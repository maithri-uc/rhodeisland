<p class="p6">The purpose of this Chapter is to develop a consumer-centered system of publicly-financed state administered health and human services that supports access to high quality services, protects the safety of the state’s most vulnerable citizens, and ensures the efficient use of all available resources by the four (4) departments responsible for the health and human services programs serving all Rhode Islanders and providing direct assistance and support services to more than 250,000 individuals and families: the department of children, youth and families; the department of health; the department of human services; and the department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals, collectively referred to within as “departments.” It is recognized that the executive office of health and human services and the departments have undertaken a variety of initiatives to further this goal and that they share a commitment to continue to work in concert to preserve and promote each other’s unique missions while striving to attain better outcomes for all the people and communities they serve. However, recent and expected changes in federal and state policies and funding priorities that affect the financing, organization, and delivery of health and human services programs pose new challenges and opportunities that have created an even greater need for structured and formal interdepartmental cooperation and collaboration. To meet this need while continuing to build on the achievements that have already been made, the interests of all Rhode Islanders will best be served by codifying in the state’s general laws the purposes and responsibilities of the executive office of health and human services and the position of secretary of health and human services.</p>

As the program’s reach has expanded, the costs of the program have continued to rise and the delivery of care has become more fragmented and uncoordinated. Given the crucial role of the Medicaid program to the state, it is of compelling importance that the state conduct a fundamental restructuring of its Medicaid program that achieves measurable improvement in health outcomes for the people and transforms the healthcare system to one that pays for the outcomes and quality they deserve at a sustainable, predictable and affordable cost.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although all attorneys have numerous important duties and responsibilities by virtue of their role as members of the bar, attorneys general have additional special duties which, because of the nature of that ancient and powerful governmental office, differ from those of the usual advocate. Unlike other attorneys who are engaged in the practice of law, the Attorney General has a common law duty to represent the public interest. State v. Lead Indus. Ass'n, 951 A.2d 428, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 79 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Contingent Fee Agreements.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is nothing unconstitutional, illegal or inappropriate in a contractual relationship whereby the Attorney General hires outside attorneys on a contingent fee basis to assist in the litigation of certain non-criminal matters. However, due to the special duty of attorneys general to “seek justice,” such contractual relationships must be accompanied by exacting limitations. The Attorney General is not precluded from engaging private counsel pursuant to a contingent fee agreement in order to assist in certain civil litigation, so long as the Office of Attorney General retains absolute and total control over all critical decision-making in any case in which such agreements have been entered into. State v. Lead Indus. Ass'n, 951 A.2d 428, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 79 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action imposing liability on former lead pigment manufacturers for creating a public nuisance, contingent fee agreements between the Attorney General and outside counsel would not violate Rhode Island Law. After a court had performed the function of reviewing and approving such a fee, allowing the requisite fee to be paid to the contingent fee counsel, the resulting balance would then be turned over to the General Treasury. State v. Lead Indus. Ass'n, 951 A.2d 428, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 79 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Public Nuisances.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>However grave the problem of lead poisoning is in Rhode Island, public nuisance law simply does not provide a remedy for this harm. The state has not and cannot allege facts that would fall within the parameters of what would constitute public nuisance under Rhode Island law. Defendant manufacturers were not in control of any lead pigment at the time the lead caused harm to children in Rhode Island, making defendants unable to abate the alleged nuisance, the standard remedy in a public nuisance action.

<p class="p6">Firms and organizations that do business with the state expect and deserve to be paid in a prompt and timely manner. Unjustified delays in paying vendors, construction contractors, and providers of service may discourage such firms and organizations from doing business with the state and may ultimately increase the costs to the state government of purchasing materials, equipment, and supplies; undertaking construction and reconstruction projects; and obtaining a wide variety of professional and other specialized services including those that are provided to persons in need. Consequently, this legislation sets standards for the payment of bills incurred by state agencies within specified periods of time and requires interest payments in situations where contract payments do not conform to these standards. Consistent with accepted business practices and with sound principles of fiscal management, it is the intent of this legislation to encourage state agencies in all three (3) branches of state government to make payments at least as expeditiously as they currently do and further reduce existing payment processing times whenever feasible, while at the same time permitting the state agencies to perform proper and reasonable financial oversight activities designed to ensure that the state government receives the quality of goods and services to which it is entitled to ensure that public funds are spent in a prudent and responsible manner.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The general assembly recognizes and declares the following purpose for enacting this chapter:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> There exists a serious shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing units that are available at rents affordable to low-income families in Rhode Island. Many families are denied access to decent housing because they are unable to meet the higher cost of rent. Rising housing costs in Rhode Island force low-income families to live in unsafe, substandard units; commit such an unreasonably high percentage of their income for rent that they deprive themselves of the other necessities of life; or, worse, find themselves without housing. The inadequacy in the supply of decent, safe, and sanitary affordable rental housing endangers the public health and jeopardizes the public safety, general welfare, and good of the entire state.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Federal housing assistance programs have not been able to meet the need to preserve existing rental units or construct new rental units for occupancy by low-income families. There is a compelling need to provide housing for low-income families in the state of Rhode Island. A rental assistance program is hereby established to be administered by the executive department to help provide low-income families with the opportunity to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> It is the intent of the general assembly to assure access to the comprehensive health care by providing health insurance to all Rhode Islanders who are uninsured;</p>
<p class="p6">Universal comprehensive coverage for all Rhode Islanders is a goal to be achieved over the course of several years;</p>
<p class="p6">The first step in providing comprehensive health coverage is to assure coverage for the most vulnerable residents of the state;</p>
<p class="p6">Uninsured pregnant women and children under age eight (8) are among the most vulnerable residents of the state; and</p>
<p class="p6">The governor’s health care advisory committee has provided advice and recommendations in its report of January, 1993 to improve access to health care for pregnant women and children up to age six (6);</p>
<p class="p6">The objectives to meet the goal of comprehensive health coverage are:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Every child under age eight (8) in Rhode Island will have a reliable source of health coverage and health care;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Every pregnant woman in Rhode Island will have early and comprehensive prenatal and maternity care services;</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> To assure access to care and availability of services, the following principles will guide the design of the health care act:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> There will be equal access to health care for children and pregnant women, regardless of the type of coverage;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> There shall be an emphasis on primary and preventive care which will include a “medical home” for every child;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Current deficiencies in the fee for service delivery system will be addressed;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> In addition to accessibility of health care, provisions must be made to address language, cultural and transportation barriers;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> Enrollment must be both timely and accomplished in a user friendly fashion;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> An adequate source of primary care providers should be developed;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> An enhanced set of services should be developed to support and address the needs of families at risk.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The general assembly finds that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The state of Rhode Island, through the Rhode Island department of transportation (“the department”), funds the reconstruction, replacement, and maintenance of all bridges in Rhode Island, except the Newport Bridge, the Mount Hope Bridge, the Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge, and the Sakonnet River Bridge.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) 2015 National Bridge Inventory (NBI) data, there are seven hundred sixty-four (764) bridges in Rhode Island greater than twenty feet (20´) in length. Of these NBI bridges, one hundred seventy-seven (177) bridges, or twenty-three percent (23%), are classified as structurally deficient.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> For the past several decades, Rhode Island has depended on three (3) primary sources for funding all transportation infrastructure construction, maintenance, and operations: federal funds, state bond funds, and motor fuel tax revenue. Of these sources, two (2), federal funds and motor fuel tax revenue, are mutable.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> The 2008 governor’s blue ribbon panel on transportation funding, the 2011 senate special commission on sustainable transportation funding, and the 2013 special legislative commission to study the funding for East Bay bridges determined that there is insufficient revenue available from all existing sources to fund the maintenance and improvement of Rhode Island transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> In 2011, the general assembly adopted a component of the recommended systemic change to transportation funding by dedicating increased resources from the Rhode Island capital plan fund and creating the Rhode Island highway maintenance account, to be funded by an increase in license and registration fees, beginning in FY2014.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> In 2014, the general assembly adopted changes to the Rhode Island highway maintenance account to provide additional state revenue for transportation infrastructure in future years.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> Although the state is shifting from long-term borrowing to reliance upon annual revenues to fund transportation infrastructure on a pay-as-you go basis, and although a recurring state source of capital funds has been established, there is still a funding gap between the revenue needed to maintain all bridges in structurally sound and good condition and the annual amounts generated by current dedicated revenue sources.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(8)</b> According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, just one, fully-loaded five-axle (5) tractor trailer has the same impact on the interstate as nine thousand six hundred (9,600) automobiles. The department estimates that tractor trailers cause in excess of seventy percent (70%) of the damage to the state’s transportation infrastructure, including Rhode Island bridges, on an annual basis. However, revenue contributions attributable to tractor trailers account for less than twenty percent (20%) of the state’s total annual revenues to fund transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(9)</b> The United States Congress, consistent with its power to regulate interstate commerce and pursuant to 23 U.S.C. § 129, has authorized states to implement reconstruction or replacement of a toll-free bridge and conversion of the bridge to a toll facility, provided that the state:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(i)</b> Has in effect a law that permits tolling on a bridge prior to commencing any such activity; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(ii)</b> Otherwise complies with the requirements of 23 U.S.C. § 129.</p>

The tolls shall be fixed after conducting a cost-benefit analysis and providing an opportunity for public comment. The tolls shall be collected on large commercial trucks only and shall not be collected on any other vehicle; provided, however, no vehicle shall be tolled other than a tractor or truck tractor as defined in 23 C.F.R. 658.5, pulling a trailer or trailers.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The general assembly recognizes that patient-centered medical home (PCMH) is an approach to providing comprehensive primary care for children, youth and adults. The patient-centered medical home is a healthcare setting that facilitates partnerships between individual patients, and their personal physicians, physician assistants and advanced practice nurses, and when appropriate, the patient’s family. Care is facilitated by registries, information technology, health information exchange and other means to assure that patients get the indicated care when and where they need and want it in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner. The goals of the patient-centered medical home are improved delivery of comprehensive primary care and focus on better outcomes for patients, more efficient payment to physicians and other clinicians and better value, accountability and transparency to purchasers and consumers. The patient-centered medical home changes the interaction between patients and physicians and other clinicians from a series of episodic office visits to an ongoing two-way relationship. The patient-centered medical home helps medical care providers work to keep patients healthy instead of just healing them when they are sick. In the patient-centered medical home patients are active participants in managing their health with a shared goal of staying as healthy as possible.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The patient-centered medical home has the following characteristics:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Emphasizes, enhances, and encourages the use of primary care;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Focuses on delivering high quality, efficient, and effective healthcare services;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Encourages patient-centered care, including active participation by the patient and family, or designated agent for healthcare decision-making, as appropriate in decision-making and care plan development, and providing care that is appropriate to the patient’s individual needs and circumstances;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> Provides patients with a consistent, ongoing contact with a personal clinician or team of clinical professionals to ensure continuous and appropriate care for the patient’s condition;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> Enables and encourages utilization of a range of qualified healthcare professionals, including dedicated care coordinators, in a manner that enables providers to practice to the fullest extent of their license;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> Focuses initially on patients who have or are at risk of developing chronic health conditions;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> Incorporates measures of quality, resource use, cost of care, and patient experience;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(8)</b> Ensures the use of health information technology and systematic follow-up, including the use of patient registries; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(9)</b> Encourages the use of evidence-based health care, patient decision-making aids that provide patients with information about treatment options and their associated benefits, risks, costs, and comparative outcomes, and other clinical decision support tools.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The general assembly recognizes that Rhode Island is a national leader in all-payer patient-centered medical homes through a model developed by providers and financed through the voluntary participation of insurers. The continuation of this model, developed by the Rhode Island chronic care sustainability initiative, is recognized as critical to the future structure of the Rhode Island primary care delivery system. The general assembly also recognizes that the model created through this legislation is not the only model for patient-centered medical homes and in no way seeks to limit the innovation of providers and insurers in the future.</p>

<p class="p6">The general assembly recognizes that open land with scenic, natural, and ecological value is important to the character of Rhode Island and provides opportunities for passive recreation. Such open land is rapidly disappearing, and it is in the best interest of the people of the state to take steps to preserve the most important of our irreplaceable open land resources. The municipalities of the state and nonprofit land trusts and other conservation organizations have expressed a willingness to act to save open land of local or regional importance and to make such land available for appropriate public use. In order to support and encourage such land preservation, to protect the scenic and natural heritage of Rhode Island, to improve our quality of life, and to enhance tourism, the general assembly hereby establishes a natural heritage revolving fund to provide zero interest loans to municipalities and to conservation organizations for projects to preserve, protect, and make available for safe use important open space and natural land throughout the state.</p>

<p class="p6">The general assembly recognizes and declares that: crime and delinquency are essentially state and local problems; crime and delinquency are complex social phenomena requiring the attention and efforts of the criminal justice system, state, and local governments, and private citizens alike; the establishment of appropriate goals, objectives, and standards for the reduction of crime and delinquency and for the administration of justice must be a priority concern; the functions of the criminal justice system must be coordinated more efficiently and effectively; the full and effective use of resources affecting state and local criminal justice systems requires the complete cooperation of state and local government agencies; and training research, evaluation, technical assistance, and public education activities must be encouraged and focused on the improvement of the criminal justice system and the generation of new methods for the prevention and reduction of crime and delinquency.</p>

<p class="p4"><b>42-26.2-2.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Legislative findings.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">It is hereby found and declared as follows:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Today’s international trade agreements have impacts which extend significantly beyond the bounds of traditional trade matters such as tariffs and quotas, and instead grant foreign investors and service providers certain rights and privileges regarding operations within a state’s territory, subject various state non-trade related laws to challenge as “barriers to trade” in the binding dispute resolution bodies that accompany the pacts, and place limits on the future policy options of state legislatures.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), for example, grants foreign firms new rights and privileges for operating within a state that exceed those granted to U.S. businesses under state and federal law. NAFTA has already generated “regulatory takings” cases against state and local land use decisions, state environmental and public health policies, adverse state court rulings, and state and local contracts that would not have been possible in U.S. courts.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> When states agree to be bound by government procurement provisions contained in trade agreements such as World Trade Organization (WTO), NAFTA and various NAFTA-expansion agreements such as Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), common economic development and environmental policies, such as buy-local laws, policies to prevent off-shoring of state jobs, as well as recycled content laws could be subject to challenge as “barriers to trade” as they contradict the obligations in the trade agreements.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> Today’s trade agreements also curtail state regulatory authority by placing constraints on future policy options. The WTO services agreement undermines state efforts to expand healthcare coverage and rein in healthcare costs, and places constraints on state and local land use planning. New negotiations in the services area will have additional implications for state regulation of energy, higher education, professional licensing, and more.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> Despite the indisputable fact that today’s international trade agreements have far-reaching impacts on state and local law and policy, federal government trade negotiators have failed to provide state legislatures with necessary information and documents regarding provisions directly affecting state jurisdiction, have failed to consult with state legislatures when seeking the consent of states to be bound to trade agreement procurement obligations, and have sought neither governor nor legislature consent before binding states to comply with numerous other trade agreement provisions.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> The current encroachment on state regulatory authority by international trade agreements has been exacerbated because U.S. trade policy is being formulated and implemented under “Fast Track” Trade Authority procedures. Fast Track eliminates any meaningful role for states and limits congress’s role to a yes or no vote with no amendments after negotiations are completed and a final agreement is signed. When Fast Track sunsets in 2007, it should be replaced with a more democratic model for negotiating trade agreements, one which ensures that the prior informed consent of states is secured before states are bound to the regulatory terms of any trade agreement.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> This law is enacted to protect the state’s sovereignty; the state’s ability to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of its citizens; and the Founders’ system of federalism in the current era of globalization.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Civilian Exclusion.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The version of this section that existed in the period between 1980-1985 limited the state police pension system to “members” of the state police so, that a civilian who was never a member of the state police could not participate in the state police retirement system, despite the absence of a provision expressly excluding civilians at the time when she retired.

<p class="p7"><b>Continuance in Service.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One who has completed one or more three-year terms as a member of the state police force is not thereby entitled to reappointment and to continue with satisfactory service toward the retirement benefits set forth in this section.

<p class="p7"><b>Disability Determinations.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice was correct in her determination that a decision denying the plaintiff a disability pension and instead placing him on retirement status pursuant to this section was neither arbitrary nor capricious where a police officer was injured while riding home from a cursory assignment on a privately owned motorcycle, accompanied by his wife.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court erred in the equitable distribution of marital assets under R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><b>Longevity Bonuses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The 1972 amendment to this section, which provides for longevity bonuses, does not apply retroactively to police officers who retired prior to the enactment of the amendment.

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The officers’ bill of rights ( §§ 42-28.6-1 — 42-28.6-15) does not violate the home rule amendment ( R.I. Const., Art. XIII) since police officers, while they may be appointed by an individual city or town, act for all the inhabitants of the state and not only for the residents of the appointing community, and the statute applies to all cities and towns and does not affect their form of government.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lynch v. King, 120 R.I. 868, 391 A.2d 117, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 735 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The officers’ bill of rights does not violate the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers by legislatively delegating an executive function to an administrative body since the legislature has the power to control the police and to vest administrative bodies or officers with some portion of that legislative power where the delegation is accompanied by standards sufficient to guide the exercise of the power delegated. Lynch v. King, 120 R.I. 868, 391 A.2d 117, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 735 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Court Action.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Service.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Service on an assistant town solicitor of a complaint requesting that the court grant a bill of rights is insufficient. International Bhd. of Police Officers, Local No. 302 v. Portsmouth, 506 A.2d 540, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 432 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Exclusive Remedy for Law Enforcement Officers.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This chapter is the exclusive remedy for permanently appointed law enforcement officers who are under investigation by a law enforcement agency for any reason that could lead to disciplinary action, demotion, or dismissal. East Providence v. McLaughlin, 593 A.2d 1345, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 134 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the injured party, an animal-control officer for the town, slipped and fell on the owners’ driveway after being called to their residence to remove a stray cat, the owners were not entitled to summary judgment pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 56 in the injured party’s negligence action; the public safety officer’s rule, which prevented a police officer or firefighter from suing landowners for injuries suffered while confronting the normal, foreseeable risks of their jobs, did not extend to the animal-control officer, as the animal-control officer did not receive the same compensation, training, and benefits as police and firefighters, and did not enjoy statutory protection of R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-1 and R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-28.6-1 et seq. DeLaire v. Kaskel, 842 A.2d 1052, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 19 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Hearing Committees.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A law enforcement agency hearing committee is not a state agency within the meaning of the Administrative Procedures Act (ch. 35 of title 42). Lynch v. King, 120 R.I. 868, 391 A.2d 117, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 735 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— “Active” Officers.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A reasonable reading of the term “active” as found in subdivision (B)(1) permits a retired officer to participate in a hearing. In re Denisewich, 643 A.2d 1194, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 202 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Privilege Against Self-Incrimination.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The introduction of grand jury testimony at hearing under this chapter could subject an officer only to liability for the potential loss of employment — a consequence to which the privilege against self-incrimination did not apply. In re Denisewich, 643 A.2d 1194, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 202 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Reconvening Hearing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The hearing committee has the inherent power, and in fact the obligation, in the performance of its duty, to reconvene for the purpose of considering recently-made available testimony and a review of the Law Officer’s Bill of Rights, and the expansive powers conferred upon the committee thereunder leads to the inescapable conclusion that the hearing committee is obligated to reconvene for the purpose of considering the relevance and materiality of grand jury testimony. In re Denisewich, 643 A.2d 1194, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 202 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Purpose of Chapter.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of this chapter is to protect police officers from any impairment of their rights when their conduct is questioned. Coalition of Black Leadership v. Cianci, 570 F.2d 12, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 12853 (1st Cir. 1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Special Injury.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was not error to grant judgment as a matter of law dismissing a police officer’s malicious prosecution claim against a town, a police chief, and a lieutenant, based on the officer’s disciplinary proceedings, conducted pursuant to the Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights (LEOBOR), R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-28.6-1 et seq., because the proceedings did not result in the required special injury, as an officer who elected to proceed with a hearing in accordance with the LEOBOR and prevailed did not suffer the type of special injury that was contemplated in the tort of malicious prosecution. Ims v. Town of Portsmouth, 32 A.3d 914, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 146 (R.I. 2011).</p>

Until such a decision is made by a police chief, the hearing provision of LEOBOR and the ensuing procedural steps are not operative. Providence Lodge No. 3, FOP v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Regardless of how many incidents are uncovered during a departmental investigation, the right to a hearing under LEOBOR simply does not vest until the chief or someone in a comparable position indicates that one of the sanctions envisioned by § 42-28.6-4 will be imposed upon the individual who has been charged with a violation of departmental rules and regulations. Until such a decision is made by a police chief, the hearing provision of LEOBOR and the ensuing procedural steps are not operative. Providence Lodge No. 3, FOP v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Police officers who sought declaratory relief concerning the validity of the city’s ordinance allowing for the investigations of the officers and the making of recommendations to the police chief did not show that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The ordinance allowed only limited oversight of the city’s police department, in the form of investigations and recommendations, and did not conflict with the Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights. Providence Lodge No. 3, FOP v. Providence External Review Auth., 951 A.2d 497, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 83 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Punitive Measure.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No clear error was present in the trial court’s determination that the reassignment of an officer from the department’s detective division to the department’s uniformed division was not a “punitive measure” and therefore not within the ambit of this section, since the transfer served the department’s best interests by removing the officer, who had leaked confidential information, from a position in which he would have access to confidential information. Morgan v. Warwick, 510 A.2d 1297, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 493 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Reconvening Hearing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The hearing committee has the inherent power, and in fact the obligation, in the performance of its duty, to reconvene for the purpose of considering recently made available testimony. A review of the Law Officer’s Bill of Rights and the expansive powers conferred upon the committee thereunder leads to the inescapable conclusion that the hearing committee is obligated to reconvene for the purpose of considering the relevance and materiality of grand jury testimony.

<p class="p7"><b>Right to Hearing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Police officer who was terminated for not returning to work after he recovered from an injury was not entitled to a hearing under R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-28.6-4 of the Rhode Island Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights (LEOBOR) because the LEOBOR was limited to instances of alleged police officer misconduct.

Town of N. Kingstown v. Local 473, Int'l Bhd. of Police Officers, N.A.G.E., 819 A.2d 1274, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 85 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Separate Hearings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The convening of a separate hearing committee to adjudicate each act underlying a recommendation of punitive action against a police officer, particularly when it is the repeated nature of the incidents that gives rise to the recommendation, is not required. Zincone v. Mancuso, 523 A.2d 1222, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 448 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Waiver.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where by executing a waiver, the plaintiff waived his right to a hearing on charges as provided by the Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights, and under the waiver, the plaintiff admitted his guilt to the charges and chose to continue his employment on a probationary status rather than proceed with a hearing and possibly risk more severe discipline, the terms of the waiver, which the plaintiff accepted through his subsequent performance, constituted the punishment imposed for the crimes, and as part of that punishment included the potential for dismissal without reason; the plaintiff’s argument that he could not waive a right that had not yet accrued for a hearing on subsequent charges therefore had no merit. McGee v. Stone, 522 A.2d 211, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 431 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since an officer is charged with constructive knowledge of the right afforded him under this section and his counsel certainly knew or should have known of his right to a hearing regarding the charges that resulted in the execution of the waiver, the officer could not have waived his right to a hearing without knowledge that he was statutorily entitled to a hearing, and the defendant’s alleged threats of loss of employment for failure to sign could not constitute duress. McGee v. Stone, 522 A.2d 211, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 431 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the plaintiff argued that a waiver of his right to a hearing was unenforceable because the right provided him under this section creates a private right for a public good, the Supreme Court found no such public purpose espoused in the Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights, and accordingly found no merit in the plaintiff’s argument.

Suspension under this subsection shall not exceed one hundred eighty (180) days.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Suspension may be imposed by the chief or highest ranking sworn officer of the law enforcement agency when the law enforcement officer in under investigation for a misdemeanor criminal matter.

In the event the law enforcement officer is acquitted of any misdemeanor related thereto, the officer shall be forthwith reinstated and reimbursed all salary and benefits that have not been paid during the suspension period.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Suspension may be imposed by the chief or highest ranking sworn officer of the law enforcement agency when the law enforcement officer is under investigation for a noncriminal matter.

Any such suspension shall consist of the law enforcement officer being relieved of duty, and he or she shall receive all ordinary pay and benefits as he or she would receive if he or she were not so suspended.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> Any law enforcement officer who is charged, indicted or informed against for a felony or who is convicted of and incarcerated for a misdemeanor may be suspended without pay and benefits at the discretion of the agency or chief or highest ranking sworn officers; provided, however, that the officer’s entitlement to medical insurance, dental insurance, disability insurance and life insurance as is available to all other officers within the agency shall not be suspended.

Whenever, upon appeal, such conviction is reversed, the suspension under this subsection shall terminate and the law enforcement officer shall forthwith be paid the salary and benefits that would have been paid to him or her during that period of suspension.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> Any law enforcement officer who pleads guilty or no contest to a felony charge or whose conviction of a felony has, after or in the absence of a timely appeal, become final may be dismissed by the law enforcement agency and, in the event of such dismissal, other provisions of this chapter shall not apply.</p>

<p class="p6">The general assembly recognizes alcohol related traffic fatalities require special legislative initiatives. Over one million (1,000,000) people are either killed or injured every year due to alcohol related crashes. About three (3) out of five (5) Americans will be affected by an alcohol related crash at some time in their lives. Economic costs of alcohol related crashes are estimated to be forty-five billion dollars ($45,000,000,000) yearly. Based on these statistics and projections, it will be the state legislature’s policy to provide more resources to state law enforcement to reduce alcohol related vehicular crashes and fatalities.</p>

Laws § 36-4-37, “just cause,” as used in § 42-29-1, does not refer to the fiscal distress of the employer; accordingly, the lay-off of sheriffs based on fiscal distress within the State was error, as such did not constitute just cause.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> It is declared that a state-wide need exists for industrial buildings and the expansion, rehabilitation, renovation, and reconstruction of existing industrial buildings and additional machinery and equipment to provide enlarged opportunities for gainful employment by the people of Rhode Island and to thus insure the preservation and betterment of the economy of the state and its inhabitants. It is also declared that it is in the interest of the public welfare and purpose to promote the expansion and diversification of industry to increase employment, prevent or reduce unemployment, and to provide a larger taxable base for the economy of the state of Rhode Island, and to generally promote economic development in Rhode Island. Therefore, the Rhode Island industrial building authority is created to encourage the making of mortgage loans for the purpose of furthering industrial expansion in the state, and, thus, improve the welfare of the public for the foregoing reasons and, by the stimulation of a larger flow of private investment funds from banks, building and loan associations, credit unions, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, including pension, retirement and profit-sharing funds, meet the need of new industrial plant expansion, the expansion, rehabilitation and renovation of existing industrial plants, and the acquisition of new machinery and equipment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> It is further declared that there is a need for the abatement or control of pollution of the environment of the state which is necessary to protect the health and welfare of the inhabitants of the state, and in particular the abatement or control of pollution by industries now operating in the state or which may in the future operate in the state. The Rhode Island industrial authority shall also exist to encourage the making of mortgage loans to enable such industries to abate or control pollution.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> It is further declared that a state-wide need exists for new recreational buildings, facilities, developments, and improvements to preserve the health and welfare of the people and to better the economy of the state. It is also declared that it is in the interest of the public welfare and purpose to promote the expansion and diversification of our recreational facilities, to increase employment, and to provide a wider tax base. Therefore, the Rhode Island industrial-recreational authority is created to encourage the making of mortgage loans for the purpose of furthering recreational expansion in the state, and, thus, improve the welfare of the public for the foregoing reasons and, by the stimulation of a larger flow of private investment funds from banks, building and loan associations, credit unions, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, including pension, retirement and profit-sharing funds, meet the need of recreational plant expansion.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> A person may petition an agency for a declaratory order that interprets or applies a statute administered by the agency or states whether, or in what manner, a rule, guidance document, or order issued by the agency applies to the petitioner.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> An agency shall promulgate rules prescribing the form of a petition under subsection (a) and the procedure for its submission, consideration, and prompt disposition. The provisions of this chapter concerning formal, informal, or other applicable hearing procedure do not apply to an agency proceeding for a declaratory order, except to the extent provided in this section or to the extent the agency provides by rule or order.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Not later than sixty (60) days after receipt of a petition under subsection (a), an agency shall issue a declaratory order in response to the petition, decline to issue the order, or schedule the matter for further consideration.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> If an agency declines to issue a declaratory order requested under subsection (a), it shall notify, promptly, the petitioner of its decision. The decision must be in a record and must include a brief statement of the reasons for declining. An agency decision to decline to issue a declaratory order is subject to judicial review for abuse of discretion. An agency failure to act within the applicable time under subsection (c) is subject to judicial action under § 42-35-15.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> If an agency issues a declaratory order, the order must contain the names of all parties to the proceeding, the facts on which it is based, and the reasons for the agency’s conclusion. If an agency is authorized not to disclose certain information in its records to protect confidentiality, the agency may redact confidential information in the order. The order has the same status and binding effect as an order issued in a contested case and is subject to judicial review under § 42-35-15.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> An agency shall publish each currently effective declaratory order on its agency website.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> An agency shall maintain a current and publicly accessible index of all of its currently effective declaratory orders on its website; file the index with the secretary of state; make the index readily available for public inspection; and make available for public inspection and, for a reasonable charge, copying the full text of all declaratory orders to the extent inspection is permitted by law of this state other than this chapter. Declaratory orders are effective only if filed with the secretary of state.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Any person, including any small business, who has exhausted all administrative remedies available to him or her within the agency, and who is aggrieved by a final order in a contested case is entitled to judicial review under this chapter. This section does not limit utilization of or the scope of judicial review available under other means of review, redress, relief, or trial de novo provided by law. Any preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency act or ruling is immediately reviewable in any case in which review of the final agency order would not provide an adequate remedy.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Proceedings for review are instituted by filing a complaint in the superior court of Providence County or in the superior court in the county in which the cause of action arose, or where expressly provided by the general laws in the sixth division of the district court or family court of Providence County, within thirty (30) days after mailing notice of the final decision of the agency or, if a rehearing is requested, within thirty (30) days after the decision thereon; provided, however, that any person who is aggrieved by a final order concerning the assessment or determination of any tax, interest, or penalty made by the tax administrator must pay the amount of the tax, interest, or penalty to the administrator as a prerequisite to the filing of such complaint. Copies of the complaint shall be served upon the agency and all other parties of record in the manner prescribed by applicable procedural rules within ten (10) days after it is filed in court; provided, however, that the time for service may be extended for good cause by order of the court.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The filing of the complaint does not itself stay enforcement of the agency order. The agency may grant, or the reviewing court may order, a stay upon the appropriate terms.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Within thirty (30) days after the service of the complaint, or within further time allowed by the court, the agency shall transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding under review. By stipulation of all parties to the review proceedings, the record may be shortened. Any party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for the additional costs. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> If, before the date set for the hearing, application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the agency, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the agency upon conditions determined by the court. The agency may modify its findings and decision by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the reviewing court.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall be confined to the record. In cases of alleged irregularities in procedure before the agency, not shown in the record, proof thereon may be taken in the court. The court, upon request, shall hear oral argument and receive written briefs.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings, or it may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The administrative head of the state police department of any party state, in his or her discretion, may withhold or recall the police forces of his or her state or any part or any member thereof, serving without its borders.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> All liability that may arise under the laws of the requesting state or under the laws of the responding state or under the laws of a third state on account of or in connection with a request for aid, shall be assumed and borne by the requesting state.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The conference shall submit to the governor or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state for presentation to the legislature thereof.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Each of the conference’s budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. The total amount of appropriations under any such budget shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: one-third (1/3) in equal shares; one-third (1/3) divided among the party states in the proportions that their populations bear to the total population of all the party states; and one-third (1/3) divided among the party states in the proportions that the major crimes committed in each party state bear to the total number of major crimes committed in all the party states. In determining population pursuant to this paragraph, the most recent decennial census compiled by the United States government shall be used. Numbers of major crimes shall be as reported in the most recent annual “Uniform Crime Report” compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States Department of Justice, or by any agency which may assume responsibility for such compilation in the place of such bureau. In the event that any source of information required to be used for the purpose of this paragraph shall be discontinued, the conference shall make its calculations on the basis of the best alternative sources of information and shall identify the sources used.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The conference shall not pledge the credit of any party state. The conference may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under article III (j) of this compact, provided that the conference takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the conference makes use of funds available to it under article III (j) hereof, the conference shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The conference shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the conference shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its rules.

<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The accounts of the conference shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party states and any persons authorized by the conference.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent conference compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the conference.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE IX — CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.

<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE I—FINDINGS</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">New England is by virtue of geographic location and other characteristics a great population, cultural, economic and resource area which, with more intense use of physical, social, and economic resources, increasingly requires coordinated planning as a basic ingredient of effective and orderly growth of the region. To this end, it is the intent of this compact to establish and provide for the operation of an interstate planning agency for New England.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE II—PURPOSE</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">It is the purpose of this compact to provide, in the New England region, improved facilities and procedures for the coordination of the policies, programs, and activities of interstate significance in the New England region in the field of physical, social and economic resources, and to study, investigate, and plan appropriate governmental activities with respect to the conservation, development and use of the same; to provide means by which interstate conflicts may be resolved; and to provide procedures for interstate coordination of the interests of all public and private agencies, persons and entities in the fields covered by this compact, and to provide an organization for cooperation in such coordination.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE III—CREATION OF COMMISSION</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">There is hereby created the New England interstate planning commission, hereinafter called the “commission.”</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE IV—MEMBERSHIP</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The commission shall consist of one member from each party state to be appointed and to serve, in accordance with and subject to the laws of the state which he or she represents. Any member of the commission may be represented by an alternate with power to act in his or her place and stead, if the laws of his or her state so provide and if notice of the designation of such alternate is given to the commission in such manner as its bylaws may provide.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE V—FUNCTIONS</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">To carry out the purpose of the compact it shall be the responsibility of the commission to prepare studies and plans, and to recommend procedures for implementing coordination of the policies and programs and activities of interstate significance in the field of physical, social, and economic conservation and development in the New England region which may include the following:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Collection and interpretation of basic data.</p>

<p class="p6">To avoid duplication of effort and in the interests of economy, the commission shall make use of existing studies, surveys, plans, data, and other materials in the possession of the governmental agencies of the party states and their respective subdivisions or in the possession of other interstate agencies. Each such agency, within available appropriations and if not expressly prevented or limited by law, is hereby authorized to make such materials available to the commission and to otherwise assist it in the performance of its functions. At the request of the commission each such agency is further authorized to provide the commission with information regarding plans and programs affecting the New England region so that the commission may have available to it current information with respect thereto.</p>
<p class="p6">The commission shall use qualified public and private agencies to make investigations and conduct research, but if it is unable to secure the undertaking of such investigations or original research by a qualified public or private agency, it shall have the power to make its own investigations and conduct its own research. The commission may make contracts with any public or private agencies or private persons or entities for the undertaking of such investigations or original research within its purview.</p>
<p class="p6">The officers and personnel of agencies of the party state, and of any other government or agency whatever, or private citizens, or representatives of private organizations, may serve at the request of the commission upon such advisory committees as the commission may determine to create; and such officers and personnel of any such government or agency, may serve upon such committees without forfeiture of office or employment and with no loss or diminution in the status, rights and privileges which they otherwise enjoy.</p>

<p class="p6">It is the finding of the general assembly that the health, safety, and welfare of many of the people of the state are being jeopardized by the failure of individual sewage disposal systems and the irremediable contamination of private drinking water wells; that these septic system failures or well contaminations while not necessarily the fault of the homeowner must either be remedied or the home must be abandoned; and that suitable remedies may be beyond the immediate financial resources of the homeowner. It is therefore the intent of the general assembly to establish a fund to be called the sewage system and water supply failure fund; and that the fund be used to provide the money necessary to remedy failed septic or water supply systems as provided in this chapter.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Notice Requirements.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The failure of a town council to comply with the open meetings law or the notice requirements of the zoning law in enacting a new zoning ordinance does not constitute a violation of due process; the ordinance is a legislative act, and procedural due process does not require that affected individuals receive notice or have an opportunity to be heard. Smithfield Concerned Citizens for Fair Zoning v. Smithfield, 719 F. Supp. 75, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9310 (D.R.I. 1989), aff'd, 907 F.2d 239, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 11007 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Town violated the Open Meetings Act by listing on its meeting notice only interviews for board and commission openings on its agenda where three appointments for the openings were actually made; this action entitled a citizen to the remedy of attorney’s fees but such award was reduced on appeal, because the trial court did not support the award of attorney’s fees on the record, therefore, the appellate court was unable to determine whether an abuse of discretion occurred. Tanner v. Town Council, 880 A.2d 784, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 154 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Town council’s actions in approving sale of property did not violate the Open Meetings Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 42, ch. 46, because the notice of the meeting at issue published five days before the meeting informed the public of the time and location of the meeting and complied with R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-46-6; the Act did not govern the veracity of the information discussed at a duly-noticed meeting or the wisdom or appropriateness of the public body’s substantive decisions. The decision to sell the property for $67,000, in light of a missing appraisal of $161,700, may have been bad government, but it was not a violation of the Act. Cullen v. Lincoln Town Council, 960 A.2d 246, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 110 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Tape Recordings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the Open Meetings Law is premised on the first amendment values of an informed public and the accountability of public institutions, certain constitutional principles should apply to the regulation of the right to tape record open, public meetings. If officials were to grant or deny permission to record on the basis of content, they would undermine the nation’s commitment to the equality of status in the field of ideas. Also, under the Equal Protection Clause, as well as under the first amendment, unbridled discretion cannot be ceded to government officials to decide whether leave to record public meetings will be granted.

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Town violated the Open Meetings Act by listing on its meeting notice only interviews for board and commission openings on its agenda where three appointments for the openings were actually made; this action entitled a citizen to the remedy of attorney’s fees but such award was reduced on appeal, because the trial court did not support the award of attorney’s fees on the record, therefore, the appellate court was unable to determine whether an abuse of discretion occurred. Tanner v. Town Council, 880 A.2d 784, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 154 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Town council’s actions in approving sale of property did not violate the Open Meetings Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 42, ch. 46, because the notice of the meeting at issue published five days before the meeting informed the public of the time and location of the meeting and complied with R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-46-6; the Act did not govern the veracity of the information discussed at a duly-noticed meeting or the wisdom or appropriateness of the public body’s substantive decisions. The decision to sell the property for $67,000, in light of a missing appraisal of $161,700, may have been bad government, but it was not a violation of the Act. Cullen v. Lincoln Town Council, 960 A.2d 246, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 110 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Waiver</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a developer claimed that there was no prior notice that a public water condition would be added to a subdivision approval, the trial court’s finding that the developer waived his right to challenge the sufficiency vel non of notice on constitutional and statutory grounds and pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-46-6(b) was proper; the developer waived whatever preexisting procedural and statutory rights were his with respect to the meeting when he took the action of telling his attorney that he had, in the words of the trial court, agreed to add the condition of public water. D'Ellena v. Town of E. Greenwich, 21 A.3d 389, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 98 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Good Faith.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the members of a school committee and a school superintendent conducted a meeting without full newspaper notification as required by this section in that their advertisement referred to a “work session” but did not contain an agenda, and at the meeting they voted to opt out of the early retirement program, since they did not act willfully or in bad faith since they did not attempt to keep the meeting secret nor to avoid meeting with those most affected by the retirement program, their action at the meeting was valid and should not have been declared null and void. Edwards v. State, 677 A.2d 1347, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 184 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Notice Insufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>City’s zoning board of review violated R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-46-6(b) of the Rhode Island Open Meetings Act, as its notice of the agenda of a meeting regarding a property owner’s petition did not identify what specific property was at issue, or indicate that any action would be taken on the request at the meeting. Anolik v. Zoning Bd. of Review of Newport, 64 A.3d 1171, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 43 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Agenda fell short of satisfying the requirements of notice set forth in this section because there was no indication that more than one pay plan would be considered or that the additional pay plans that were ultimately considered and decided by the council at the meeting would relate to retrospective fiscal years; the public had the statutory right to receive a more complete notice of what would be discussed and decided at the meeting, especially where the matters related to expenditures of taxpayer monies.

<p class="p7"><b>Attorney’s Fees.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court properly granted a motion for attorney’s fees under R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-46-8(d) in an action seeking a declaratory judgment that a state emergency hiring council was subject to the Rhode Island Open Meetings Act. Solas v. Emergency Hiring Council, 774 A.2d 820, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 190 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Town violated the Open Meetings Act by listing on its meeting notice only interviews for board and commission openings on its agenda where three appointments for the openings were actually made; this action entitled a citizen to the remedy of attorney’s fees but such award was reduced on appeal, because the trial court did not support the award of attorney’s fees on the record, therefore, the appellate court was unable to determine whether an abuse of discretion occurred. Tanner v. Town Council, 880 A.2d 784, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 154 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Declaring Action Null and Void.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the members of a school committee and a school superintendent conducted a meeting without full newspaper notification as required by § 42-26-6 in that their advertisement referred to a “work session” but did not contain an agenda, and at the meeting they voted to opt out of the early retirement program, since they did not act willfully or in bad faith since they did not attempt to keep the meeting secret nor to avoid meeting with those most affected by the retirement program, their action at the meeting was valid and should not have been declared null and void. Edwards v. State, 677 A.2d 1347, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 184 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in declaring a meeting null and void under the statute because the persons seeking to contest the meeting for lack of adequate notice lacked standing where they had actually appeared at the meeting, along with legal representation and a large number of media personnel, and therefore were no aggrieved by any defect in the notice. Graziano v. R.I. State Lottery Comm'n, 810 A.2d 215, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 212 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Notice Requirement.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No violation of the open meetings law occurred as the parties were actually present at the meeting to terminate the director’s position with the lottery commission and thus were not aggrieved by any defect in the notice, the public was also present and thus not aggrieved, and the meeting was neither corrupt, surreptitious, nor held in the absence of the light of public view. Graziano v. R.I. State Lottery Comm'n, 810 A.2d 215, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 212 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Despite a town’s subsequent voluntary compliance with the Open Meetings Act by issuing a second meeting notice to the initial misleading notice the issues of whether the town council in fact violated the Open Meetings Act during that first meeting and, if so, whether it did so willfully, were justiciable controversies entitling a citizen to pursue his complaint against the town. Tanner v. Town Council, 880 A.2d 784, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 154 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Standing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Town resident, asserting a violation of the Open Meetings Act, in a suit against the town, had standing to bring the action pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-46-8(a)(c) since his allegation that a meeting notice listed only interviews for board and commission openings on its agenda but, in fact, the three appointments for such openings were actually made at the meeting, established the resident as an aggrieved person. Tanner v. Town Council, 880 A.2d 784, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 154 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Association did not have standing to raise a claim under the Open Meetings Act, § 42-46-1 et seq., because standing under the act was statutorily limited to individuals.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> It is hereby found and declared as follows: there exists a serious shortage of safe and sanitary residential housing and shelter in the state available to and affordable by persons and families of low and moderate income, the elderly and workers, and their families; this condition is conducive to disease, crime, environmental decline, and poverty, and impairs the economic development of the state and communities and the economic value of large areas, which are characterized by depreciated value, impaired investments, and reduced capacity to pay taxes and is a menace to the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the citizens of the state; this condition results in a loss of population and further deterioration accompanied by added costs to communities in the creation of new public facilities and services elsewhere; it is difficult and uneconomical for individual owners independently to remedy this condition; it is desirable to encourage joint efforts to clear, re-plan, rehabilitate, and reconstruct these areas; it is necessary to create inducements and opportunities for private and public investment in these activities in these areas with appropriate planning, land use, and construction policies; it is also necessary to assist owners of residential housing to retain and operate these units; these activities on a large scale are necessary for the public welfare and are public uses and purposes for which private property may be acquired; one major cause of this condition has been recurrent shortages of funds from private sources; these shortages have contributed to reductions in construction of new residential units, have resulted in the sale of existing housing owned by persons and families of low and moderate income, and have made the purchase of existing residential units a virtual impossibility in certain parts of the state; hospital and other health care services provided at reasonable cost are of vital concern to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the state, and existing hospitals and other health care facilities are no longer adequate to meet the needs of modern medical care; the ordinary operations of private enterprise have not in the past corrected these conditions; the reduction in residential and health care facility construction has caused substantial unemployment and under-employment in the construction industry which results in hardships, wastes human resources, increases the public assistance burdens of the state, impairs the security of family life, impedes the economic and physical development of the state, and adversely affects the welfare, health, and prosperity of all the people of the state; a stable supply of adequate funds for residential and health care facility financing is required to encourage new housing and health care facilities in an orderly and sustained manner and thereby reduce these results; it is necessary to create a state housing and mortgage finance corporation to encourage the investment of private capital and stimulate and assist in the construction, rehabilitation, operation, retention, and maintenance of residential housing and health care facilities through the use of public financing, to provide construction and mortgage loans, to make grants to shelters for the homeless, and to make provision for the purchase of mortgage loans and otherwise; it is further necessary that the corporation be provided with the power to acquire and operate housing projects on an individual or partnership basis in order to meet the housing demands of the state; and all of the foregoing are public purposes and uses for which public moneys may be borrowed, expended, advanced, loaned, or granted.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> It is further found and declared as follows: Rhode Island has distinctive historical development patterns and natural systems, which are critical to public health, welfare, community and neighborhood identity and functionality, and quality of life, and which merit preservation, protection, and enhancement; state and local government have planning and regulatory processes that have as their purposes the accomplishment of this preservation, protection, and enhancement; it is necessary that the corporation exercise its powers and administer its programs and responsibilities in a manner that is consistent with and advances the purposes of duly adopted state plans, including specifically the state guide plan, adopted pursuant to § 42-11-10, and with local comprehensive plans, prepared and adopted pursuant to chapter 22.2 of title 45, that have been approved as consistent with the state guide plan.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Director of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections derives his authority to impose discipline pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-10. State Dep't of Corr. v. R.I. Bhd. of Corr. Officers, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 35 (R.I. Feb. 3, 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Many of the annotations appearing below are to cases decided under repealed provisions of title 13 which were to some extent embodied in the enactment of this section.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Arbitration.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although § 28-29-1 empowers an arbitrator to modify a penalty imposed by an employer, unless the parties agree in writing that he should have no such authority, that statute must be harmonized with those provisions set forth in this section, which outlines the powers of the director of the Department of Corrections. State Dep't of Corrections v. Rhode Island Bhd. of Correctional Officers, 725 A.2d 296, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an arbitrator determined there was just cause for disciplinary measures, but substituted his judgment of what the proper disciplinary action should be for that of the director of the Department of Corrections, the trial court correctly determined that the legislature did not intend that the paramount disciplinary function of the director should be subject to the caprice of an arbitrator. State Dep't of Corrections v. Rhode Island Bhd. of Correctional Officers, 725 A.2d 296, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-9-1 allows employers’ penalties in disciplinary matters to be modified by an arbitrator, but an arbitrator lacked the authority to modify the decision of the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (DOC) to terminate a correctional officer because § 28-9-1 had been harmonized with R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-10(2) and (7) (1956) to preclude the disciplinary decisions of the Director from being usurped by arbitrators. Once the arbitrator found that the officer had violated DOC policy, the arbitrator could not then modify the punishment given to the officer by the Director. State Dep't of Corr. v. R.I. Bhd. of Corr. Officers, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 35 (R.I. Feb. 3, 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Director of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections, unlike other agencies affected by R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-29-1, is not in the position to delegate disciplinary functions to an arbitrator, as the discipline of employees in a correctional facility is a highly specialized function of the Director; the Director, alone, must decide disciplinary actions in correctional facilities, and in harmonizing R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-10(2) and (7) with R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-9-1 it is the intent of the legislature to preserve the disciplinary functions of the Director over the broad powers given to arbitrators. State Dep't of Corr. v. R.I. Bhd. of Corr. Officers, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 35 (R.I. Feb. 3, 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Arbitrator acting pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws. § 28-9-1 did not have the authority to alter the discipline imposed by the director of corrections; the disciplinary powers of the director under this section could not be bargained away. State v. R.I. Bhd. of Corr. Officers, 819 A.2d 1286, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 94 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Arbitrator impermissibly substituted his judgment for that of the Department of Corrections in regard to the Department terminating an employee, since, while the Department lacked a specific policy prohibiting the use of the towels and linens, that did not equate with permission to remove them from departmental premises. Dep't of Corr. v. R.I. Bhd. of Corr. Officers, 867 A.2d 823, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was no error to vacate an arbitration award because the arbitrator substituted the arbitrator’s judgment as to proper discipline for that of the director of the Department of Corrections (director), contrary to R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-10, giving the director nondelegable authority to maintain order at state correctional facilities. State Dep't of Corr. v. R.I. Bhd. of Corr. Officers, 115 A.3d 924, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 62 (R.I. 2015).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure of a guard to notice the escape for a period would not constitute an abandonment of his custody, for custody of a prisoner is not abandoned until his sentence is completed or he is pardoned, and therefore the defendant would be criminally liable for the escape. State v. McInerney, 53 R.I. 203, 165 A. 433, 1933 R.I. LEXIS 58 (1933).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Escape of Prisoner.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whatever may be the conduct of the jailer, the prisoner cannot shield himself therewith from the charge of escaping custody, if he leaves the place of his confinement. State v. McInerney, 53 R.I. 203, 165 A. 433, 1933 R.I. LEXIS 58 (1933).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Liberty of Jail Yard.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In granting to persons imprisoned the liberty of the jail yard, the keeper of the jail is exercising an administrative function. Sullivan v. Davis, 38 R.I. 382, 96 A. 216, 1916 R.I. LEXIS 2 (1916).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the keeper grants liberty of the jail yard to one not enumerated in § 10-12-1, he has exceeded his authority and permitted an escape for which he would be liable on his bond.

<p class="p7"><b>Release of Inmate on Civil Process.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If one is imprisoned under a sentence of the law, no officer can take him from such imprisonment on civil process. In re Harriott, 18 R.I. 12, 25 A. 349, 1892 R.I. LEXIS 5 (1892).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Requiring Involuntary Overtime by Officers.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The director may properly require officers to work involuntary overtime. Vose v. Rhode Island Bhd. of Correctional Officers, 587 A.2d 913, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A collective bargaining agreement which limits the director to ordering involuntary overtime only in “emergencies” is invalid because it is an improper attempt to contractually restrict the director’s statutory powers.

<p class="p7"><b>Training.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-10(14) does not prevent the Rhode Island Department of Corrections’ director from exercising his power in consultation with the union as the statute does not specify that the statutory duty and authority to establish training programs for its employees is exclusive; a union is statutorily entitled to negotiate over matters that directly affect the work and welfare of its members. State v. R.I. Bhd. of Corr. Officers, 64 A.3d 734, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 63 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly confirmed an arbitration award for a union in dispute over weapons training for correctional officers (COs) and refused to vacate the award where: (1) the director of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections’ (DOC) duty and authority under R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-10(14) to establish training programs for correctional officers (COs) was not exclusive; (2) the union was entitled to negotiate over matters that directly affected its members’ work and welfare; (3) § 42-56-10(14) did not prevent the DOC director from exercising his power in consultation with the union; (4) the dispute was arbitrable; and (5) the arbitrator’s reading of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-17 as meaning that COs had to undergo weapons qualification at least every two years, and prescribing a maximum time period, rather than a minimum or fixed time period, within which COs had to complete weapons qualification was passably plausible. State v. R.I. Bhd. of Corr. Officers, 64 A.3d 734, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 63 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Transfer of Minor Inmates.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The power to transfer inmates to any other institutions for better care of such person is held to include minor inmates transferred to adult correctional institutions. Long v. Langlois, 93 R.I. 23, 170 A.2d 618, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 72 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The transfer of minor inmates to an adult correctional institution, where the assistant director believed such transfer would serve the purpose of reforming such inmates, did not interfere with any constitutional right.

<p class="p7"><b>Treatment of Inmates.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since all policies, practices and administrative procedures are set by and are under the control of the director of the department of corrections, and since he set no policies to safeguard inmates against unconstitutional conduct on the part of his subordinates, he had to be held responsible.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Community Confinement Act must be strictly construed and applied. Thus, the supreme court has no power to initiate a change to home-confinement status after a defendant has begun to serve the sentence imposed, and the trial justice may only order a change to home confinement after the director of corrections has made a written application suggesting that such a change in a defendant’s status is warranted. Since that procedure was not followed in this case, the order granted by the superior court is quashed. State v. Mariano, 648 A.2d 803, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 248 (R.I. 1994).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Aggregation of Sentences.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section provides for the aggregation of consecutive sentences only in determining the basis for computing the good-time credit; there is no provision for aggregating concurrent sentences. State v. Ouimette, 118 R.I. 525, 375 A.2d 209, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1494 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Calculation of Time.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The method of calculation chosen by the Department of Corrections, in its discretion, only affects the manner in which the department accomplishes the task of granting good time credits and the matter of internal management is not subject to the requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act, 1G.L. 1956, chapter 35 of title 42. Leach v. Vose, 689 A.2d 393, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 22 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the inmate’s 10-year sentence was reduced to six years on appeal, where the inmate had been granted the maximum amount of good-time credit pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-24 both during the 17 months the inmate served the 10-year sentence and the remaining time in which the inmate was serving a six-year sentence, and where the inmate’s good-time credits were reduced to reflect the shorter sentence, the reduction was proper; the reduction of the sentence nullified the 10-year sentence, and R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-24 did not allow for good-time benefits based upon a sentence that the inmate never served. Morey v. Wall, 849 A.2d 621, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 113 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Length of a probationer’s sentence was not miscalculated because the probationer’s credits for good conduct and participation in institutional industries, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-24, and for time served awaiting disposition, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-19-2(a), did not entitle the probationer to an acceleration of the end date of the probationer’s probationary term. Rose v. State, 92 A.3d 903, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 20 (R.I. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court erred in denying the State’s request to adjudge defendant a probation violator because he was on probation and subject to being adjudged a violator at the time of the incident; because defendant was sentenced to a 30-year term, and the effect of his good-time or time-served credits reduced his period of incarceration but did not reduce the overall length of his sentence, his sentence officially ended 30 years later. State v. Parrillo, 158 A.3d 283, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Facts did not present the proper circumstance for the doctrine of equitable estoppel to apply against the State; the letter from the Department of Correction stating that defendant’s probationary period had ended was not only in direct contradiction to the judicially-imposed 30-year sentence, it also contradicted §§ 42-56-24 and 12-19-2(a), including the effect the credits had on the length of his sentence. The case was remanded, however, for consideration of defendant’s due process argument. State v. Parrillo, 158 A.3d 283, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Consecutive Sentences.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inmate who had served two of his three consecutive eight-year sentences was entitled to receive a maximum “good-time” credit of 10 days per month throughout all the years of his imprisonment, even while he served the final eight-year sentence. Gomes v. Wall, 831 A.2d 817, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 192 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Due Process.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no liberty interest created by the Rhode Island good time and industrial time credit statute since it is completely discretionary; the Department of Correction’s modification of its manner of calculating good time and industrial time credits does not implicate the due-process clause. The Department can decide, within its discretion, whether to award good time and industrial time credits at all, so an inmate cannot claim a violation of his or her liberty interests when the Department decides to change the actual method of calculation. Leach v. Vose, 689 A.2d 393, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 22 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Habeas Corpus.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A petition for habeas corpus was dismissed where the petitioner contended that he was entitled to be credited with six days good behavior for each month as provided by the former statute under a 1960 amendment, rather than the five days each month previously provided for, since at the time for application for habeas corpus the petitioner would still be lawfully confined, even if given credit for six days each month. Ouimette v. Langlois, 97 R.I. 210, 196 A.2d 828 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Legislative Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Legislature clearly intended that an inmate not be entitled to good time credits for a month in which he or she has been disciplined for bad conduct. The Legislature also deemed it necessary to provide for additional deterrent penalties to discourage inmate violation of prison rules and requirements, and in response to that need, it enacted subsection (c) of this section. That subsection mandates that, in addition to not permitting an errant inmate to accumulate good time credits for a month in which the inmate exhibits bad conduct, the inmate, in addition, loses one day of already earned good time credits for each day the inmate is disciplined, to be deducted from the inmate’s earlier accumulation of monthly credits. Leach v. Vose, 689 A.2d 393, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 22 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Mootness.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the Department of Corrections’ computation of good-time credit under R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-24(a) neither implicated a constitutional right, nor a matter of extreme public importance, nor an issue that was likely to recur in such a way as to evade judicial review, the appeal was moot. Toro v. Wall, 926 A.2d 1019, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 69 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Postconviction Application.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An application for postconviction relief under § 10-9.1-1 is the correct procedure for claims involving computation of goodtime credit, rather than Rule 80 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.Leonardo v. Vose, 671 A.2d 1232, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 61 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Application for post-conviction relief was not the only vehicle for correcting an improper calculation of an inmate’s rights under R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-24; because the issue was how, rather than whether, the maximum amount of good-time credits were to be calculated, the court did not err in treating the case as a request for declaratory or injunctive relief, despite the fact that the inmate sought mandamus relief. Morey v. Wall, 849 A.2d 621, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 113 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inmate’s reliance on alleged Rhode Island Department of Corrections (DOC) representations as to the estimated time to serve had no bearing on the knowing and voluntary nature of the inmate’s nolo contendere plea for R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 11 purposes, even though DOC’s method of calculating such credits was changed after the state’s highest court found that the up-front method of calculating the credits violated R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-24(a), as: (1) DOC had the discretion to decide whether to award good-time and industrial-time credits at all; and (2) the trial court had no authority over DOC’s determination with respect to individual inmates. Cote v. State, 994 A.2d 59, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 56 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inmate did not show that the inmate’s nolo contendere plea was involuntary for R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 11 purposes, even though the Rhode Island Department of Corrections’ (DOC) method of calculating such credits was changed after the state’s highest court found that the up-front method of calculating the credits violated R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-24(a), as: (1) the inmate only presented the inmate’s unsubstantiated assertions that the inmate was informed by the DOC that the inmate might serve a lesser time based upon a table circulated to inmates illustrating credits that could be received for good-behavior and work-time; (2) there was no evidence of discussions before the trial court at the plea hearing as to the inmate’s understanding of the voluntariness of the inmate’s plea; and (3) the inmate provided no documentation of good-behavior and work-time credits actually earned during the inmate’s incarceration. Cote v. State, 994 A.2d 59, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 56 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Requirements.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A prisoner is not automatically entitled to good behavior allowance, but action by the named officials is required. Lee v. Kindelan, 80 R.I. 212, 95 A.2d 51, 1953 R.I. LEXIS 54, cert. denied, 345 U.S. 1000, 73 S. Ct. 1146, 97 L. Ed. 1406, 1953 U.S. LEXIS 1975 (1953).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section good behavior or good time credits do not accrue as a matter of constitutionally vested and protected property rights guaranteeing a prisoner immediate up-front credit deductions from his total prison term sentence, but are a matter of discretion, i.e., they must be earned and can only be given by the required affirmative action of the designated department of correction officials. Barber v. Vose, 682 A.2d 908, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 225 (R.I. 1996).</p>

If any person, including any member of the correctional staff at the state department of corrections, is assaulted or comes into contact with bodily fluid from an inmate or detainee, a department of corrections physician will incorporate accepted medical standards and determine whether the incident places the exposed person at risk for HIV or any other blood borne disease. This may involve drawing a serum sample on the source inmate or detainee in accordance with § 23-6.3-4 and performing tests to determine the presence of blood borne infections such as HIV or hepatitis virus.

The legislature further finds that events of recent years have demonstrated that abnormal market disruptions, as they relate to energy supplies, could be imminent due to both natural and man-made causes.

<p class="p6">It is declared that the energy wasted by inefficient appliances results in higher utility bills and hastens the need for new electricity generating facilities, and therefore, is a burden to the economic growth and the prosperity of the citizens of the state. Reducing demand for energy is a more cost effective and lower environmental impact strategy than the continuation of the current energy use, and therefore it is in the public interest of the state to establish minimum energy efficiency standards for appliances. Federal legislation already regulates many appliances, but the additional regulation of fluorescent light ballasts will greatly reduce our need to expand energy resources.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(b) In the 2012 general election, a majority of Rhode Island voters statewide and in the Town of Lincoln approved the following referendum question (among others):</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(d) In the voter information handbooks setting forth and explaining the question in each instance, ‘casino gaming’ was defined to include games ‘within the definition of Class III gaming as that term is defined in section 2703(8) of Title 25 of the United States Code and which is approved by the State of Rhode Island through the Lottery Division.’ ‘Casino gaming’ is also defined to include games within the definition of class III gaming in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>section 42-61.2-1 of the general laws.</p>

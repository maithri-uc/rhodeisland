<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Before the 1986 amendment to Art. I, § 2, the Rhode Island Constitution contained only a criminal due process provision, R.I. Const., Art.I, § 10, and did not contain a due process clause applicable to civil actions. Kelly v. Marcantonio, 678 A.2d 873, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 187 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Construction.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is advisory and not mandatory, and is addressed to the general assembly by way of advice and direction, rather than to the courts by way of enforcing restraint upon the lawmaking power.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In re Dorrance-Street, 4 R.I. 230, 1856 R.I. LEXIS 25 (1856);<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Crafts v. Ray, 22 R.I. 179, 46 A. 1043, 1900 R.I. LEXIS 74 (1900);<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sayles v.

LEXIS 110 (1958) (decided under former Constitution).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whether this section is advisory or mandatory with reference to the exercise of legislative power, such question is of no consequence where proposed legislation is submitted to the people and their approval in accordance with an express provision of the constitution relating specifically to such kind of legislation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Opinion to Governor, 88 R.I. 202, 145 A.2d 87, 1958 R.I.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The standard of review for determining whether legislation violates this provision, which is essentially a guarantee of equal protection of the laws, is whether the challenged statute is a capricious exercise of the legislature’s law-making power.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>City of Warwick v. Almac's, Inc., 442 A.2d 1265, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 817 (R.I. 1982) (decided under former Constitution).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The intent of the drafters in adding a “due process” and an “equal protection” clause to the new constitution clearly was to parallel the language of the U.S. Const., amend. 14. Jones v. Rhode Island, 724 F. Supp. 25, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13903 (D.R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Article 1, § 2, of the Rhode Island Constitution is an adoption by this state of an equal-protection and nondiscrimination clause that contains protections similar to the equal-protection guarantees contained in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The record of the constitutional convention and the language of the amendment itself indicate that the convention had no intention of acting beyond that point and incorporating an ERA-type provision. The enumeration of “race, gender and handicap” was not intended to mandate, nor does it require courts to consider, issues of classification, raised under these constitutional guarantees, in any way different from actions prior to 1986 when courts addressed issued of race, gender, and handicap. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic League, 612 A.2d 734, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 183 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is undisputed that intermediate scrutiny is applied to gender classifications. Intermediate scrutiny requires that classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives in order to be constitutional. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic League, 612 A.2d 734, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 183 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The constitutional equal protection guarantee does not prohibit all legislative classifications; when a statute involves neither a suspect classification nor a fundamental right, nor a gender-based classification, the proper standard of review is minimal scrutiny. Dowd v. Rayner, 655 A.2d 679, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 53 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a statutory classification does not involve a fundamental right and is not related to a suspect classification, the test for constitutionality is whether the classification is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Rhode Island Insurer's Insolvency Fund v. Leviton Mfg. Co., 716 A.2d 730, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 261 (R.I. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1068, 119 S. Ct. 797, 142 L. Ed. 2d 659, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 125 (1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a challenged economic statute responds to a legitimate legislative concern and the statute may achieve a resolution of that problem, the statute must be sustained on equal protection grounds. Rhode Island Insurer's Insolvency Fund v. Leviton Mfg. Co., 716 A.2d 730, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 261 (R.I. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1068, 119 S. Ct. 797, 142 L. Ed. 2d 659, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 125 (1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Contempt adjudications against print and broadcast media were set aside because they did not provide sufficient notice regarding restrictions on publishing information regarding witnesses in a celebrated murder trial, one witness in which had been murdered on the eve of trial; furthermore, the court held that the underlying prior restraints were also too restrictive to pass First Amendment muster. In re Court Order Dated October 22, 2003, 886 A.2d 342, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 158 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Antidiscrimination clause in R.I. Const. Art. 1, § 2 is not self-executing and does not give rise to a private right of action; the clause does not set forth rules that give its principles the force of law nor does it contain a directive to the legislature for further action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doe v. Brown Univ., 253 A.3d 389, 2021 R.I. LEXIS 77 (R.I. 2021).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The party challenging the constitutional validity of a statute carries the burden of persuading the court beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislation violates an identifiable aspect of the constitution. Dowd v. Rayner, 655 A.2d 679, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 53 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Businesses and Professions.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A criminal statute requiring profit corporations to pay wages weekly did not violate this section as to those corporations chartered before the statute’s enactment, where the power to alter, amend or repeal corporate charters expressly was reserved to the general assembly. State v. Brown &amp; Sharpe Mfg. Co., 18 R.I. 16, 25 A. 246, 1892 R.I. LEXIS 1 (1892).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>G.L. 1909, ch. 193, § 3 [former § 5-37-2] regulating practice of medicine was not in conflict with this section, since the professional qualifications described therein constituted a reasonable classification concerning a proper subject of legislative control. State v. Heffernan, 40 R.I. 121, 100 A. 55, 1917 R.I. LEXIS 14 (1917).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Statute regulating the business of undertaking which made no attempt to bring about any unreasonable or arbitrary classification among undertakers and which applied to all engaged in that occupation was not in violation of this section. Prata Undertaking Co. v. State Bd. of Embalming &amp; Funeral Directing, 55 R.I. 454, 182 A. 808, 1936 R.I. LEXIS 5 (1936).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Department of Transportation’s refusal to renew an applicant’s chauffeur’s license for failure to satisfy minimum vision requirements did not violate the applicant’s constitutional right to work under the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, § 2 of the Rhode Island Constitution. Allard v. Department of Transp., 609 A.2d 930, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 100 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since commercial fishermen failed to carry their burden of showing that a statute forbidding use of self-contained underwater breathing apparatus equipment to harvest shellfish from four named saltwater coastal ponds violated their equal protection and substantive due process guarantees, a trial court erred in entering summary judgment in their favor; R.I. Const. art. I, § 17 obliged the legislature to act to safeguard fishery resources for all citizens, not just commercial fishermen, and the challenged statute had a rational relationship to that duty, which was all that was required. Cherenzia v. Lynch, 847 A.2d 818, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 49 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management was entitled to summary judgment on the fishermen’s claim that the lobster trap allocation scheme under R.I. Marine Fisheries Regulation 15.14.2-6 denied the fishermen their fundamental right of equal access to the fisheries as guaranteed by R.I. Const. art.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Contentions that P.L. 1915, ch. 1278 delegated to the city of Providence the right to decide ex parte the necessity of a taking of property for public use and authorized such city to take possession and dispose of property without offering compensation or having value determined could not be founded on this section, as this section is intended to prohibit exactions of money from litigants for the granting of justice. Joslin Mfg. Co. v. Clarke, 41 R.I. 350, 103 A. 935, 1918 R.I. LEXIS 50 (1918), writ of error dismissed, 251 U.S. 535, 40 S. Ct. 55, 64 L. Ed. 401, 1919 U.S. LEXIS 1809 (1919).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section did not apply to an act which authorized the acquisition of the assets of an old company by a new company. Narragansett Elec. Lighting Co. v. Sabre, 50 R.I. 288, 146 A. 777, 1929 R.I. LEXIS 64 (1929).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is not limited to a prohibition of the purchase and sale of justice.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was nothing in the record that indicated that R.I. Const. art.

Ruggiero v. City of Providence, 889 A.2d 691, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 224 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Gas company’s argument that a landowner was precluded from seeking abatement or other injunctive relief for contamination of his property by hazardous substances when the contamination violated state environmental laws was not supported by either logic or law; R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-1-1 expressly permitted a private citizen to seek abatement or injunctive relief in an action for nuisance and state environmental laws were not intended to preempt that right. Corvello v. New Eng. Gas Co., 532 F. Supp. 2d 396, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6923 (D.R.I. 2008).</p>

Conley v. Woonsocket Inst. for Sav., 11 R.I. 147, 1875 R.I. LEXIS 13 (1875).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Dismissal of an action because the plaintiff failed to comply with a court order to give surety for costs under G.S. 1872, ch. 195, § 26 [former § 9-22-2] when the plaintiff is too poor to procure surety would be inconsistent with this section, so that in such a case the court should not order the plaintiff to give surety. Spalding v. Bainbridge, 12 R.I. 244, 1879 R.I. LEXIS 2 (1879).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where action was dismissed by district court for failure to furnish surety for costs under G.

Lewis v. Smith, 21 R.I. 324, 43 A. 542, 1899 R.I. LEXIS 60 (1899).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A statute exempting legislators from the process of courts during the legislative session may deny a person’s right to obtain justice promptly and without delay and is therefore in violation of this section.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action for negligent sterilization resulting in the birth of a child, plaintiffs would be entitled to recover the medical expenses of the ineffective sterilization procedure, the medical and hospital costs of the pregnancy, the expense of a subsequent sterilization procedure, loss of wages, loss of consortium to the spouse arising out of the unwanted pregnancy, and medical expenses for prenatal care, delivery, and postnatal care. However, no recovery would be allowed for emotional distress arising out of the birth of a healthy child. Emerson v. Magendantz, 689 A.2d 409, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 69 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No Interference With Right.</b></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Action of mayor in discharging members of board of canvassers and registration for malfeasance, conducting hearing and refusing to reinstate them, was not unconstitutional under this section, since such removal did not constitute any injury to person or property.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a defendant was represented by counsel of his choice, assisted his counsel in the design of a plea agreement that prevented him from felony charges and, after thorough questioning by the hearing justice, had the opportunity to “sleep on” his decision to enter into the agreement, he could not claim his rights were violated by that agreement. State v. D'Amario, 725 A.2d 276, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 18 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a plea agreement included a provision preventing the defendant from appearing pro se for a period of three years, this was a reasonable limitation that did not affect rights so fundamental as to be unwaivable, given the limited resources of the courts and the unreasonable demands on those resources posed by relentless, frivolous filings. State v. D'Amario, 725 A.2d 276, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 18 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Recreational Use Statute.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Recreational Use Statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 32-6-1 et seq., was not unconstitutional.

<p class="p6"><b>Restitution for Excessive Taxation.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the alternative relief sought by the plaintiffs is that recovery be allowed for the excess tax that was paid because not all classes of property liable to taxation were assessed at a single, uniform percentage of full and fair cash value, but the plaintiffs do not prove what portion of the tax paid constituted an illegal or disproportionate tax, the plaintiffs are not entitled to a rebate of the entire tax, and their prayer for restitution for repayment is denied.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A plea agreement that included a provision whereby the defendant could not appear pro se for a period of three years was affirmed with a modification that it not be construed so as to prevent the defendant from defending himself or petitioning a justice to seek relief from the order in an appropriate circumstance.

<p class="p6"><b>Rights of Prisoners.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The right to call witnesses, like other due process rights, is circumscribed by the necessary mutual accommodation between institutional needs and objectives and the provisions of the Constitution that are of general application.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The better course at this time, when prison practices are diverse and somewhat experimental, is to leave matters of confrontation and cross-examination to the sound discretion of the officials of state prisons.

<p class="p6"><b>Statute of Limitations.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notwithstanding the fact that application of the statute of limitations would deprive the plaintiff of a remedy against the later-added defendants, the statutory limitation on plaintiff’s ability to maintain the action of medical malpractice would not result in an unconstitutional deprivation of plaintiff’s rights, as statutes of limitation are vital to the welfare of society and are favored in law. Young v. Park, 116 R.I. 568, 359 A.2d 697, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1308 (1976).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 9-1-13(b), which requires that claims for recovery of damages involving injury-causing products must be commenced within ten years after the date the product was first purchased for use or consumption, is unconstitutional, as it completely denies products-liability claimants of their day in court, notwithstanding the merits of their claims and the direct liability of the potential defendants. If the constitutional guarantee of right of access to the courts is to have any meaning, this statute must be struck down. Kennedy v. Cumberland Eng'g Co., 471 A.2d 195, 1984 R.I.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 9-1-29, which requires that claimants who bring actions in tort against constructors of improvements to real property must do so within 10 years of the substantial completion of the improvement, does not violate this section, which guarantees access to the courts.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Limitation on medical malpractice actions in § 9-1-14.1 places a reasonable limit on the parties’ right to have their claims adjudicated by the courts and does not violate the open courts provision of this section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dowd v.

<p class="p6"><b>Statutory Notice Requirements.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The notice requirement in § 24-5-14 does not amount to an unconstitutional denial of access to the courts in violation of this provision. This provision should not be interpreted to bar the Legislature from enacting any laws that may limit a party from bringing a claim in Rhode Island courts, and notice requirements that are imposed only on victims of governmental tortfeasors are rationally based and constitutionally valid.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature in the exercise of its broad police power can provide for a distinction between “detention” and “arrest”; and a period of detention reasonably limited, unaccompanied by unreasonable or unnecessary restraint and based upon circumstances reasonably suggestive of criminal involvement is lawfully distinguished from an arrest by the legislature, creating no deprivation of liberty, due process, right to bail, speedy trial, representation by counsel and habeas corpus as guaranteed by the constitution. Kavanagh v. Stenhouse, 93 R.I. 252, 174 A.2d 560, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 102 (1961).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In attempting to ascertain whether a person was arrested at a given time, the court looks to several factors, including the following: The extent to which the person’s freedom of movement has been curtailed and the degree of force used by the police, the belief of a reasonable innocent person in the same circumstances, and whether the person had the option of not going with the police. State v. Bailey, 417 A.2d 915, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1720 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s liberty was not so curtailed as to constitute an arrest where, after receiving a telephone request from police, he went to a police station for questioning, was not told that he was under arrest or that he was not free to go, and chose to remain at the station and answer questions.

<p class="p6"><b>— Investigatory Stops.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Investigatory seizures, such as the taking of a person to police headquarters, have been held to be arrests for constitutional purposes and consequently require for their legality the existence of probable cause. State v. Frazier, 421 A.2d 546, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1857 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Police do not need probable cause to stop a suspect for questioning if unusual or suspicious activity leads an officer to conclude, in light of his experience, that the individual may be involved in criminal activity.

<p class="p6"><b>— Probable Cause.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where arresting officers observed no overt acts but acted upon mere suspicion in taking defendant to the police station, the officers at that time were without any grounds of probable cause that a felony had been committed or that defendant was committing one. The quantum of information which constitutes probable cause — evidence which would “warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief” that a felony has been committed — must be measured by the facts of the particular case. State v. Dufour, 99 R.I. 120, 206 A.2d 82, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 405 (1965).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 12-7-3(a) authorizing a warrantless arrest on reasonable grounds that a misdemeanor was committed meets the requirement of probable cause and was not in violation of this amendment.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The crucial issue is whether at the moment of the arrest the facts and circumstances within the police officer’s knowledge and of which he had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent person’s believing that the arrestee had committed or was committing an offense.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the arrest or search is made when the police do not know that a crime has been committed, more and better evidence is needed to prove that probable cause exists for the arrest than is the case when the police do know that a crime has been committed.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whether information an arresting officer receives through police channels can serve as the basis for a warrantless arrest depends in part on whether the information is reasonably trustworthy.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When an arrest is made without a warrant, the standard for measuring probable cause must be at least as stringent as when a warrant is obtained. State v. Bennett, 430 A.2d 424, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1161 (R.I. 1981).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis; an arrest is not fatally pretextual merely because the police officers have a dual motive for making an arrest as long as probable cause exists sufficient to justify the original stop or search.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Existence of probable cause to arrest without a warrant depends on whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the arresting officer possesses sufficient trustworthy facts and information to warrant a prudent officer in believing that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense; the probable-cause inquiry should focus on the arresting officer’s general knowledge and experience, as well as information received by the arresting officer through official channels and via the collective knowledge of the police department.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Based on experience in narcotics, a surveillance detective determined that a suspected drug transaction had taken place between defendant and a buyer. He seized a bag suspected to be cocaine, and then relayed the information via police radio to an arresting detective who was told the location of defendant and a description of his vehicle. When the arresting officer responded to the call within minutes of the suspected drug deal, defendant’s car was still parked in the exact spot the first detective had described. The information the arresting officer received through official channels had the requisite probable cause to arrest defendant, thus, the arrest was lawful; accordingly, defendant’s extemporaneous statements were not fruits of a poisonous tree, and defendant’s motion to suppress his statements was properly denied. State v. Castro, 891 A.2d 848, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 17 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an informant told police that defendant admitted killing the victim, and told them a detail about the murder that had not been released publicly, her information about defendant, coupled with his own statements and actions, furnished probable cause to arrest him without a warrant; therefore, his confession and evidence seized by police were admissible.

State v. Jeremiah, 696 A.2d 1220, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 213 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A warrant describing the property and articles to be searched for as “any and all evidence of breaking and entering of dwellings, and possession of stolen goods, to include, but not limited to, jewelry, coins, collectors’ items, electronic equipment, etc.” was adequate and sufficiently descriptive where the defendant, who had been taken into custody during the afternoon, was likely to be released on bail or recognizance within a short time of his arrest, thus necessitating the request for authorization to execute the warrant during the nighttime. State v. Rose, 748 A.2d 1283, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 86 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Warrant issued to search defendant’s residence did not have to specify a particular location within the residence because (1) there was probable cause to search the whole house, and (2) the place to be searched could be identified by those executing the warrant. State v. Storey, 8 A.3d 454, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 110 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For purpose of the execution of the search warrant, even though the Unit 2 listed in the warrant did not exist, and a group home was being operated at the physical address listed in the warrant, the warrant described the place to be searched and the items to be seized with sufficient particularity, and the officers were permitted to perform the search on that existing warrant. In re Austin B., 208 A.3d 1178, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 85 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Probable Cause.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Affidavit issued on complaint that several persons had visited house briefly and then left was insufficient to show probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant. State v. Butts, 97 R.I. 147, 196 A.2d 415, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 54 (1964).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Affidavit that affiants have reason to believe that the defendant is conducting a resort for gambling, that they were informed and had investigated that the defendant on a certain date registered a bet, and that they had long had him under surveillance, without setting out reasons for such belief, the source of their information, nor the results of their investigation and surveillance was not a sufficient basis for finding of probable cause for issuance of a search warrant. State v. Le Blanc, 100 R.I. 523, 217 A.2d 471, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 472 (1966).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Probable cause did not exist, nor was the affidavit proper, where only suspicions without facts were set forth that a bet was accepted by telephone on a number supplied by an informer, and the informer’s credibility, reliability and/or first-hand knowledge was not alleged. State v. Connell, 113 R.I. 605, 324 A.2d 331, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1215 (1974).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A search warrant may not be challenged as issued without probable cause merely because one or more of the persons toward whom the probable cause pointed turned out ultimately to be innocent: any contrary rule would require the evidentiary support necessary for probable cause to rise to the level of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Kowal, 423 A.2d 1380, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1866 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An affidavit establishes probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant, where the affidavit asserts that a confidential informant had furnished information in the past leading to the arrest and conviction of an individual for a narcotics offense, and the credibility of the informant is supported by an independent police investigation that corroborates the informant’s account. State v. Riccio, 551 A.2d 1183, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 150 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Only the probability, and not a prima facie showing, of criminal activity is required to establish probable cause, and the issuing justice’s determination of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing courts. State v. Baldoni, 609 A.2d 219, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 142 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the affidavit submitted in support of an apartment search warrant described the defendant’s purchase of approximately 29 pounds of marijuana and the subsequent forfeiture of approximately 26 pounds by an undercover officer to the police department, and where the affidavit further expressed the police department’s belief that the defendant “had given or sold those (missing) three pounds to person or persons unknown”, because the affidavit was devoid of any facts or other evidence to support the conclusion that the defendant had actually sold the marijuana, the issuing magistrate could reasonably conclude that the defendant had not sold or given away the drugs, but in fact still possessed them in his home. State v. Pratt, 641 A.2d 732, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 161 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The issuing magistrate had probable cause to issue a search warrant based on an affidavit referencing a written statement obtained from the defendant’s roommate describing defendant’s behavior when he arrived at their apartment after the charged offense occurred. State v. Correia, 707 A.2d 1245, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 104 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Requisite nexus between contraband described in a search warrant affidavit and the place to be searched need not be based on direct observation of the suspect with the contraband at or near the area to be searched. Rather, it may be found in the type of crime, the nature of the items sought, the extent of the suspect’s opportunity for concealment, and normal inferences as to where a criminal would be likely to hide items of the sort sought in the warrant. State v. Byrne, 972 A.2d 633, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 78 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As a reasonable inference could be drawn from the facts alleged in a detective’s affidavit that defendant would take home the easily transportable digital camera he used to take photos beneath a child’s skirt, a warrant to search defendant’s home for cameras was supported by probable cause under U.S. Const. amend. IV and R.I. Const. art. I, § 6. State v. Byrne, 972 A.2d 633, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 78 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Search warrant affidavit established probable cause to issue a search warrant for defendant’s residence, under the totality-of-the-circumstances test, because the confluence of an anonymous tip, twelve cut plastic baggies from defendant’s trash, cocaine residue on one baggie, defendant’s non-drug-related criminal history, and inferences therefrom showed a “fair probability” that drugs and indicia of drug distribution would be found at the residence. State v. Storey, 8 A.3d 454, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 110 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Totality of the circumstances presented in an affidavit in support of a search warrant allowed the magistrate to reasonably infer that drugs would be found in defendant’s apartment, as the affiant stated that a confidential informant reported the sale of cocaine by a black male from an apartment, and police determined that defendant was that male and lived in that apartment. State v. Cosme, 57 A.3d 295, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 160 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Respondent juvenile’s motion to suppress was properly denied because the warrant was based on probable cause as the warrant application listed the correct IP address that was suspected of involvement with child pornography and the correct physical address linked to that IP address; and the fact that the named subscriber did not reside at the physical address listed in the warrant did not invalidate the warrant. In re Austin B., 208 A.3d 1178, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 85 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Scope.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a murder case, police did not exceed the scope of a second warrant in seizing a camera and its contents from defendant’s residence where the camera was metal or hard plastic and was a compact piece of equipment that could have been swung to inflict serious pain, and thus it fell within the language of the warrant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>State v.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Two-month-old tip relied on to obtain a warrant to search defendant’s residence was not stale because trash seized from the residence shortly before the warrant was issued refreshed the tip, as evidence found in the trash was directly consistent with the tip.

<p class="p6"><b>Double Jeopardy.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Indictment of defendant for being a common seller of liquor under section of a statute which required three sales as evidence of being a common seller did not subject defendant to double jeopardy on the ground that he was subject to indictment under another section of the statute for each sale of liquor, since the defendant was not indicted for making any one sale, but for being a common seller. State v. Johnson, 3 R.I. 94, 1855 R.I. LEXIS 1 (1855).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A defendant could not plead prior jeopardy on the ground that he had previously been charged with the same offense where the district court which had power to try or bind over had dismissed the prior charge for failure to prosecute after a plea of not guilty.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Discharge on writ of habeas corpus of prisoner indicted for murder who had been imprisoned without trial for a period of six months contrary to provisions of G.L. 1909, ch. 354, § 17 [§ 12-13-7] did not constitute a discharge for the offense of murder but was only a discharge from prison under the indictment so that when state nol-prossed and a new grand jury returned another indictment for murder, the prior discharge was not a bar to the prosecution. State v. Deslovers, 40 R.I. 89, 100 A. 64, 1917 R.I. LEXIS 15 (1917).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Acquittal on charge of assault could not be pleaded as a bar to a subsequent charge for rape where the prior court did not have jurisdiction to try the offense of rape.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where sentence of petitioner was to to begin after expiration of prior sentence he was then erroneously thought to be serving and it was later discovered that he was not serving a prior sentence, a correction of the sentence four days later, when he was again brought before the court, did not constitute two sentences on one indictment and was not a violation of his constitutional rights under this provision. Sanford v. Langlois, 93 R.I. 1, 170 A.2d 283, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 69 (1961).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s acquittal on charge of driving under the influence of liquor does not preclude the introduction of such evidence in the trial of defendant for driving so as to endanger, death resulting, and the defendant’s right against double jeopardy is not thereby violated. State v. Amaral, 109 R.I. 379, 285 A.2d 783, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 1196 (1972).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was double jeopardy to indict on both a crime of violence and assault with a dangerous weapon where all elements of the former crime were included in those of the latter. State v. Boudreau, 113 R.I. 497, 322 A.2d 626, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1203 (1974).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The granting of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal under the Rules of Criminal Procedure of the Superior Court did not preclude on double jeopardy grounds a changed ruling and submission of the original charges to the jury, where the granting of the motion only had the effect of reducing certain charges and was never communicated to the jury. State v. Iovino, 524 A.2d 556, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 449 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The record was barren of any evidence of a manifest necessity that would justify the declaration of a mistrial due to the sudden illness of a juror, where there was a strong possibility that the juror could have returned to his duties after a few days away from the courthouse, and, therefore, the defendant’s retrial was barred by the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. State v. Sanchez, 541 A.2d 455, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 59 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Double jeopardy does not bar the state from proceeding on all three available theories of murder in the second degree where a charge of second-degree murder has been reinstated without limitation one day after the grant of a judgment of acquittal on the charge. State v. Iovino, 554 A.2d 1037, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 31 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant’s convictions on abominable and detestable crime against nature counts violates the prohibition against double jeopardy, where some, if not all, of the actions underlying the conviction are the same acts that constituted the basis of the defendant’s first degree sexual assault convictions. State v. Barnes, 559 A.2d 136, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 95 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the same set of facts give rise to the charges as contained in counts 2, 4, and 7 of a criminal information lodged against a defendant, who argues that the information is multiplicious and a violation of his Federal and State Constitutional protections against double jeopardy and that counts 4 and 7 are lesser included offenses of count 2 and do not require proof of any additional facts, the trial justice is correct in denying the defendant’s motion to compel election because the state can prove any one of the charges at trial if the evidence elicited supports a guilty verdict, and because the defendant can adequately prepare a defense, as he is effectively put on notice of the possible conviction of a lesser offense supported by the evidence. State v. Tessier, 589 A.2d 1199, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 78 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant, who was convicted on two counts of first-degree sexual assault, is not placed in double jeopardy, where two separate acts, one occurring outdoors in the woods and one in a bathroom, properly constitute the basis for two separate charges of first-degree sexual assault. State v. Purro, 593 A.2d 450, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 133 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Only where the governmental conduct in question is intended to “goad” the defendant into moving for a mistrial may a defendant raise the bar of double jeopardy to a second trial after having succeeded in aborting the first on his own motion. State v. Perez, 605 A.2d 1305, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 69 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The double-jeopardy clause did not bar the state from prosecuting a juvenile defendant in the superior court following his participation in a waiver-of-jurisdiction hearing in the family court, since the double-jeopardy clause applies only to proceedings that are “essentially criminal”, subjecting the defendant to the possibility of punitive incarceration. State v. Grabowski, 644 A.2d 1282, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 196 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although first-degree murder and second-degree murder constitute the “same offense” under Rhode Island law, the defendant’s retrial for second-degree murder, the lesser-included offense, following his acquittal on the charge of first-degree murder, did not violate his constitutional rights against double jeopardy, since first-degree murder also requires proof of premeditation of more than a momentary duration and proof of deliberation, whereas second-degree murder does not, thus satisfying the applicable “same evidence” test. State v. Grabowski, 644 A.2d 1282, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 196 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant never properly brought the defense of double jeopardy to the trial justice’s attention, nor did the facts give rise to one of the limited situations wherein the court would address a double jeopardy claim despite its improper assertion. State v. Thomas, 654 A.2d 327, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining whether a defendant is threatened with being twice prosecuted for the same offense, the “same evidence” test is applied; that is, whenever a defendant is charged under multiple statutory provisions based on a single criminal episode, that defendant may be prosecuted for each offense only if each crime requires proof of an element distinct from the other. There can be no doubt that assault with a dangerous weapon under § 11-5-2 and leaving the scene of an accident under § 31-26-1 require proof of different elements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>State v. Sabetta, 672 A.2d 451, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 64 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since possession of the same shotgun and possession of the same cocaine served as the basis for charges of possession of cocaine while having available a shotgun, and possession of a shotgun while committing a crime of violence, being in possession of cocaine, double jeopardy attached. In re Malik D., 730 A.2d 1070, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 136 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Prior finding that a confined juvenile who refused to participate in required psychiatric treatment was in civil contempt did not preclude, on double jeopardy grounds, a later prosecution for criminal contempt based on continued noncompliance. State v. Price, 820 A.2d 956, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Standard for determining whether an accused is in danger of being twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense, in violation of R.I. Const. art. 1, § 7, precluding such conduct, is the same standard that is enunciated in the <i>Blockburger </i>test; because of the similar wording and purpose underlying § 7 and U.S. Const. amend. V on this subject, Rhode Island cases have hewed closely to United States double-jeopardy law when applying R.I. Const. art. 1, § 7. State v. Rodriguez, 822 A.2d 894, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 113 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the <i>Blockburger </i>test is satisfied, then a court can impose separate and cumulative sentences because such sentences can be given after conviction of two or more crimes that are not the “same” offense under <i>Blockburger</i>; but if the crimes are found to be the “same” under <i>Blockburger</i>, then the court must examine the challenged statutes to ascertain whether the legislature intends to authorize cumulative sentencing in the circumstances of the case at bar. State v. Rodriguez, 822 A.2d 894, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 113 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant waived an argument that convictions and separate sentences for second-degree murder and carrying a dangerous weapon in the commission of a crime of violence violated double jeopardy guarantees by failing to raise it in a pretrial motion; nonetheless, the court ruled on the merits and held in furtherance of <i>Rodriguez</i>, that the two crimes were separate for double jeopardy purposes as each required an element that the other did not, namely, commission of a murder and the carrying of a dangerous weapon. State v. McGuy, 841 A.2d 1109, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 209 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Collateral estoppel, under R.I. Const. art. I, § 7, did not bar State from prosecuting defendant for firearms violations because, although the offenses had been tried in a probation violation hearing, an appeals court had quashed that judgment; thus it was a nullity and had no preclusive effect. State v. Santiago, 847 A.2d 252, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 82 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s convictions for first-degree murder and discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, resulting in death did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause in R.I. Const. art. I, § 7. State v. Feliciano, 901 A.2d 631, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 140 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rhode Island trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to dismiss, on double jeopardy grounds, a kidnapping charge due to his conviction in New York of felony murder, with the same kidnapping being the predicate felony. Defendant did not show that the cooperative efforts of officials of both states in investigating and prosecuting him defeated the dual sovereignty rule. State v. Rodriguez, 917 A.2d 409, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 30 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Dual convictions for carrying a dangerous weapon when committing a crime of violence and first-degree robbery did not constitute a double jeopardy violation because each offense included an additional element of proof that was not contained in the other; the jury could have returned a verdict of guilty on the robbery charge based on either defendant’s use of a dangerous weapon or the injury inflicted upon the victim, while the conviction for committing a crime of violence while armed or having available a firearm did not require that the weapon be used or that there be an injury to the victim. State v. Stone, 924 A.2d 773, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 77 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the court determined that defendant’s actions, which resulted in robbery, felony assault, and obstruction charges being filed against him, violated his probation, but it never convicted or punished him for those offenses, the State’s subsequent prosecution of defendant for those offenses did not implicate double jeopardy considerations under R.I. Const. art. I, § 7. State v. Yates, 934 A.2d 222, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 97 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and assault and battery resulting in serious injury did not merge, as defendant’s assault of the victim with a screwdriver supported the former, while the dislocation of the victim’s shoulder supported the latter. State v. Scanlon, 982 A.2d 1268, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 127 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant did not preserve for review a merger claim under the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions, U.S. Const. amend. IV, and R.I. Const. art. I, § 7 as the merger issue was not raised before the trial justice as required by R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(2), and the trial justice did not rule on the issue; however, defendant could seek relief under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 within 120 days of the opinion. State v. Shelton, 990 A.2d 191, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 35 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Convictions for robbery and using a firearm during a violent crime did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the state and federal constitutions, where the General Assembly expressed a clear directive that consecutive sentences be imposed for certain violence crimes committed by use of a firearm. State v. Marsich, 10 A.3d 435, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 118 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was no double jeopardy violation under the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the federal and Rhode Island Constitutions in defendant’s conviction of assault with a dangerous weapon (ADW) and larceny since ADW was not a lesser included offense of larceny, and the ADW and larceny convictions were based on distinct acts as the larceny occurred after the ADW and was not related to the ADW, which was motivated by defendant’s rage against the victim.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>State v. Oliver, 68 A.3d 549, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 117 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s convictions and sentences for using a firearm to commit second-degree murder and second degree murder did not violate double jeopardy because (1) each crime required proof of a fact the other did not, and (2) the legislature intended consecutive sentences under the circumstances. Linde v. State, 78 A.3d 738, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 135 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not entitled to acquittal on double jeopardy grounds as to convictions for discharging a firearm in commission of a crime of violence and assault with intent to murder because the legislature clearly intended multiple sentences for such convictions arising from one incident. State v. Young, 78 A.3d 787, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 142 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the question of double jeopardy was not properly raised prior to trial under the rules of criminal procedure, and the issue was waived, nonetheless, there was no double jeopardy violation to remedy; defendant stood convicted of (and punished for) assault by strangulation, and was acquitted of assault with a dangerous weapon. State v. Funches, 160 A.3d 981, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 72 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Civil Fines.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A fine assessed against a former mayor for violations of the Code of Ethics may represent punishment to the extent that it would bar a subsequent prosecution for criminal acts under double jeopardy analysis, if the fine is not merely remedial but also serves a retributive or deterrent purpose.

<p class="p6"><b>— Retrial.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A retrial following a mistrial was not barred, where the record did not indicate any attempt by the prosecution or the court to goad defendant into seeking a mistrial. State v. Mallett, 604 A.2d 1263, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though the necessity for a mistrial was brought about by the state’s failure to comply with the rules of discovery, double-jeopardy principles did not preclude a second trial. There is only one exception to the general rule that a mistrial requested by a defendant does not bar a retrial: when the prosecutorial conduct in question was intended to “goad” the defendant into moving for a mistrial. State v. McIntyre, 671 A.2d 806, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 63 (R.I. 1996).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because it was undisputed that the State’s discovery violation was unintentional, there were no double jeopardy issues that would preclude a new trial. State v. Gonzalez, 923 A.2d 1282, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 83 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to dismiss an indictment for murder and assault on double jeopardy grounds, after he was granted a mistrial in the first trial as a result of the prosecutor eliciting testimony from a witness that referenced defendant’s purported drug business, as there was no evidence that the prosecution goaded defendant into moving for a mistrial based on mistakenly eliciting the testimony. The record and transcript indicated that both the prosecution and the defense were surprised by the witness’s testimony and prosecutorial mistake did not, in and of itself, constitute goading. State v. O'Connor, 936 A.2d 216, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 124 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Retrial on the charge of kidnapping did not violate double jeopardy, as there was not abuse of discretion by the trial judge when he determined that the jury was “genuinely deadlocked” after he had made a prudent examination of the jury’s progress, provided supplemental instructions, and requested that the jurors return to deliberations for a reasonable period. State v. Gordon, 30 A.3d 636, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 133 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to dismiss a charge of second-degree sexual assault on double jeopardy grounds under R.I. Const. art. 1, § 7 and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution because sufficient evidence supported the trial court’s finding that the prosecutor’s production during trial of a revised statement from the complaining witness was not intended to provoke a mistrial. State v. Rolle, 84 A.3d 1149, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 16 (R.I. 2014).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court properly denied defendant’s motion to dismiss, on double jeopardy grounds, a criminal information charging him with breaking and entering a dwelling; while the prosecutor’s comment during closing argument indirectly addressed defendant’s failure to take the witness stand, the comment was likely the result of a mistake and was not intended to goad defendant into seeking a mistrial. The prosecutor’s misconduct did not occur when the case was unraveling, the prosecutor’s experience was minimal, and the trial justice considered all of the arguments presented by the parties and performed a balanced and conscientious analysis of the objective facts and circumstances in the case. State v. Corleto, 161 A.3d 504, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 81 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s right to be free from double jeopardy was not violated because he merely asserted that admitting the acquitted conduct into evidence, under R.I. R. Evid. 404(b), would force him to relitigate issues already decided by a valid judgment of acquittal, but defendant did not argue that the jury in the first trial necessarily decided the ultimate issue in count five, one of the first-degree sexual assault counts, which resulted in a deadlocked jury and was the only count for which the State sought a retrial; and his argument that admitting the acquitted conduct into evidence would force defendant to relitigate those same issues already decided by a valid judgment of acquittal conflated a double jeopardy contention with one that was evidentiary.

<p class="p6"><b>Grand Jury.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This provision gives to an accused the right to insist that the indictment be found by a legally constituted grand jury. State v. Muldoon, 67 R.I. 80, 20 A.2d 687, 1941 R.I. LEXIS 75 (1941).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An indictment would be quashed as invalid, when properly challenged, where any one member of grand jury was drawn or qualified by a person other than the one designated by law. State v. Muldoon, 67 R.I. 80, 20 A.2d 687, 1941 R.I. LEXIS 75 (1941).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Grand jurors from cities not drawn and qualified by appointed jury commissioner in compliance with P.L. 1939, ch. 700 [§ 9-9-1 et seq.] after its effective date but taken from list of those drawn and qualified by clerk of superior court under pre-existing law were not grand jurors within the meaning of this section. State v. Muldoon, 67 R.I. 80, 20 A.2d 687, 1941 R.I. LEXIS 75 (1941).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The presence of an officially-appointed court stenographer, serving within the conditions imposed by the statute which authorizes the use of the stenographer appointed by court under certain circumstances to report stenographically the testimony given before grand jury and to be present only during the taking thereof would not deprive an accused of any rights guaranteed under either the state or federal constitutions. State v. Edwards, 89 R.I. 378, 153 A.2d 153, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 96 (1959).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The term “county” is used to define the territorial limits of the jurisdiction of the grand jury, and since it is merely an appendage of the court for which it is summoned and authorized to inquire, its jurisdiction may be made coextensive with that of the court’s jurisdiction and the territory over which such jurisdiction extends, and not necessarily confined to the geographical lines of any county. Therefore it is clear that the legislature by the enactment of § 37 of General Laws 1938, ch. 506, now § 12-11-2, expressly provided that the jurisidiction of the grand jury would be coextensive with that of the court when sitting for those counties. State v. Edwards, 89 R.I. 378, 153 A.2d 153, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 96 (1959).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the jurisdiction of the superior court includes geographically both counties, and since the jurisdiction of the grand jury is coextensive with that of the court under whose supervision it is impaneled, it is the court’s opinion that with respect to grand jury proceedings the combined counties are a “county” within the meaning of the declarement of common law where all members of the grand jury must be residents of the county for which they are sworn to inquire. Therefore, there is no merit in defendant’s contention that the statute which authorized the Bristol residents to serve on the instant grand jury is unconstitutional. State v. Edwards, 89 R.I. 378, 153 A.2d 153, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 96 (1959).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Upon discovery that the jurisdiction of a charge of assaulting with a dangerous weapon was in the family court by reason of the fact that the victim was the defendant’s wife, it was improper for the superior court to refer the case to the family court notwithstanding the fact that the indictment had been returned by the superior court grand jury and the family court had no grand jury. State v. Perry, 103 R.I. 6, 234 A.2d 115, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 568 (1967).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Prosecutors were not required to introduce “substantially exculpatory” evidence to the grand jury, where the exculpatory evidence in a charge of first degree sexual assault under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-2 was merely the defendants’ claim of consensual sex. The proposed evidence in the case that the two defendants had consensual sex with the woman allegedly victimized was not clearly substantially exculpatory, but instead went to the competency of the state’s evidence. State v. Russell, 950 A.2d 418, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 80 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Indictment.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unlike the federal system, the criminal charging process created by this constitutional provision permits a defendant to be charged by either grand jury indictment or by information filed by the Attorney General or his or her designated assistant.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section may be waived by the accused and was not violated by the trial of a defendant with his consent on an affidavit that contained his correct name on the jacket but a wrong name in the body of the indictment, where the court with the consent of the accused amended the indictment by correcting the name in the body. Picillo v. Sharkey, 107 R.I. 147, 265 A.2d 644, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 751 (1970).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Simplified indictment for embezzlement authorized by G.L. 1909, ch. 345, § 18, under which the court may order a bill of particulars, did not violate this section, because bill of particulars is not an amendment of an indictment nor does it supply a defect therein.

State v. Ephraim, 80 R.I. 321, 96 A.2d 641, 1953 R.I. LEXIS 70 (1953).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a conviction under R.I. Gen.

<p class="p5">All persons imprisoned ought to be bailed by sufficient surety, unless for offenses punishable by imprisonment for life, or for offenses involving the use or threat of use of a dangerous weapon by one already convicted of such offense or already convicted of an offense punishable by imprisonment for life, or for offenses involving the unlawful sale, distribution, manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture, sell, distribute or deliver any controlled substance or by possession of a controlled substance punishable by imprisonment for ten (10) years or more, when the proof of guilt is evident or the presumption great. Nothing in this section shall be construed to confer a right to bail, pending appeal of a conviction. The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety shall require it; nor ever without the authority of the general assembly.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>Bail After Conviction.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A justice of the superior court was entitled to require defendant to post additional bail of $8,000 after he was found guilty of manslaughter, notwithstanding that prior bail of $2,500 had not been defaulted or broken, since the state was entitled under this provision to a guaranty in sufficient amount that the defendant would be in court when required.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In re Mariano, 4 R.I. 534, 84 A. 1086, 1912 R.I. LEXIS 81 (1912).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section confers the right to bail only in those cases in which the accused has not had a trial and does not confer that right pending appeal from a conviction. Quattrocchi v. Langlois, 100 R.I. 741, 219 A.2d 570, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 506 (1966); City of Warwick v. Robalewski, 120 R.I. 119, 385 A.2d 669, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 642 (1978).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Despite heavy proof of guilt, post conviction bail remains within trial court’s discretion based on good faith appellate grounds, likelihood of new violent acts, community and family ties and severity and circumstances of sentence with conviction of violent crime not an automatic bar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>State v. Abbott, 113 R.I. 430, 322 A.2d 33, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1195 (1974).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Denial of bail on appeal of rape and kidnapping convictions was abuse of discretion where based only on nature of the offense and amount of proof.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>State v. Abbott, 113 R.I. 430, 322 A.2d 33, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1195 (1974).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Bail pending appeal of an unsuccessful collateral attack on a final conviction should be granted only in exceptional cases. State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1840 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court requires an applicant who requests bail to show that incarceration pending review of his application for post-conviction relief would be manifestly unjust. State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1840 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In assessing applications for bail pending direct appeal consideration should be given to: (1) whether the appeal is taken for delay or in good faith on grounds not frivolous but fairly debatable; (2) the habits of the individual regarding respect for the law insofar as they are relevant on the question of whether an applicant’s release would pose a threat to the community; (3) local attachments to the community by way of family ties, business or investment; (4) the severity of the sentence imposed, and circumstances relevant to the question of whether a defendant would remove himself from the jurisdiction of the court. State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1840 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For purposes of granting bail, the supreme court shall treat an appeal from a denial of an application for post-conviction relief as equivalent to a denial of a writ of habeas corpus following a final conviction. Thus, the court’s inherent power to grant bail pending review of a habeas challenge to a final conviction is incorporated in a review of the merits of an application for post-conviction relief. State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1840 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Bail Opposed by State.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the right to bail is sought after a party has been indicted for murder, where the state opposes bail, it must carry the burden of proving that guilt is evident or presumption great, since a person is innocent until proven guilty. Taglianetti v. Fontaine, 105 R.I. 596, 253 A.2d 609, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 793 (1969).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Bail Pending Retrial.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment but conviction was subsequently vacated and a new trial ordered, defendant was entitled to bail pending retrial, since case of North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969), precluded imposition of life imprisonment or any other enhanced penalty on retrial. Clarke v. Moran, 451 A.2d 577, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1060 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Bail Revocation.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The requirements of due process apply to bail revocation proceedings; therefore, a defendant awaiting a revocation hearing has the right to a speedy determination of his status. Mello v. Superior Court, 117 R.I. 578, 370 A.2d 1262, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1729 (1977).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A bail revocation hearing must be conducted with the same promptness as the hearing which follows state opposition to the granting of bail (see § 12-13-1.1 and Super. R. Crim. P. 5); a two-week delay in the bail revocation hearing is clearly unlawful. Mello v. Superior Court, 117 R.I. 578, 370 A.2d 1262, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1729 (1977).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The standard of proof applicable in bail revocation hearings is that evidence must “reasonably satisfy that there had been a violation”; this standard requires the state to go beyond probable cause and affords a defendant the necessary due process. Mello v. Superior Court, 117 R.I. 578, 370 A.2d 1262, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1729 (1977).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Conditions Imposed on Bail.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The action of the trial court in imposing the condition of good behavior on a defendant requesting release on bail is not unconstitutional. Mello v. Superior Court, 117 R.I. 578, 370 A.2d 1262, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1729 (1977).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not provide a continuing, renewable right to bail on the same charge where a bail condition has been breached. Mello v. Superior Court, 117 R.I. 578, 370 A.2d 1262, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1729 (1977).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Denial of Bail.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although this section states that bail may be denied only when defendant has been charged with a crime which is punishable by death or life imprisonment, it is not confined to crimes which carry mandatory life sentences, but applies also to crimes where death or life imprisonment could possibly be imposed. Fountaine v. Mullen, 117 R.I. 262, 366 A.2d 1138, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1622 (1976).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even where both conditions for denying bail are satisfied, denial of bail is not mandatory, but rather the hearing judge should determine whether defendant should be granted bail as a matter of discretion. Fountaine v. Mullen, 117 R.I. 262, 366 A.2d 1138, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1622 (1976); DiMasi v. Mullen, 117 R.I. 281, 366 A.2d 1149, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1624 (1976).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is constitutionally permissible to hold a defendant without bail in order to prevent danger to the community. Witt v. Moran, 572 A.2d 261, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 58 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 12-13-5.1, which provides that no absolute right to bail exists for defendants charged with the delivery of a controlled substance when the proof of guilt is evident or the presumption great, is constitutional. However, the trial justice may not rely solely on the statute in denying a defendant’s bail. In deciding whether to grant bail, the trial justice must make findings of fact on the record that relate to the individual defendant’s dangerousness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Witt v. Moran, 572 A.2d 261, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 58 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Detention.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>G.L. 1938, ch. 625, § 68, cl. 11, as amended by P.L. 1941, ch. 982 [former § 12-7-13], under which a defendant could be detained twenty-four hours before arraignment, did not violate the defendant’s right to be admitted to bail since G.L. 1938, ch. 501, § 1 [§ 12-10-1] did not mean that the courts must be open twenty-four hours a day for the transaction of criminal business. State v. Wax, 83 R.I. 319, 116 A.2d 468, 1955 R.I. LEXIS 68 (1955).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature in the exercise of its broad police power can provide for a distinction between “detention” and “arrest”; and a period of detention reasonably limited, unaccompanied by unreasonable or unnecessary restraint and based upon circumstances reasonably suggestive of criminal involvement is lawfully distinguished from an arrest by the legislature, creating no deprivation of liberty, due process, right to bail, speedy trial, representation by counsel and habeas corpus as guaranteed by the constitution. Kavanagh v. Stenhouse, 93 R.I. 252, 174 A.2d 560, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 102 (1961).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Determining Factors.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining whether the proof of guilt is evident or the presumption great, the hearing judge at a pretrial bail hearing shall not make any determination of guilt, but shall merely determine whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the state, is legally sufficient to sustain a guilty verdict. Fountaine v. Mullen, 117 R.I. 262, 366 A.2d 1138, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1622 (1976); DiMasi v. Mullen, 117 R.I. 281, 366 A.2d 1149, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1624 (1976).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining whether the proof of guilt is evident or the presumption great, a confession obtained in violation of defendant’s Miranda rights may not be relied upon and denial of bail based solely upon such a confession is improper. Massey v. Mullen, 117 R.I. 272, 366 A.2d 1144, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1623 (1976).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining whether the proof of guilt is evident or the presumption great, under the test set out in Fountaine v. Mullen, 117 R.I. 262, 366 A.2d 1138 (1976), the court need not assess the credibility of witnesses, since the evidence is to be viewed in the light most favorable to the state. DiMasi v. Mullen, 117 R.I. 281, 366 A.2d 1149, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1624 (1976).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Juveniles.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The right to bail guaranteed by this section extends only to persons imprisoned; juveniles held pending delinquency proceedings are not so detained. Morris v. D'Amario, 416 A.2d 137, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1662 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Juveniles seeking release pending adjudication are not situated like adults applying for bail pending trial. A child does not have the unqualified right of individual liberty that an adult has because a child is subject to parental control. Therefore, the full basis for bail does not exist with regard to children, for a child released on bail would not gain individual freedom from custody but would simply be restored to parental control. Morris v. D'Amario, 416 A.2d 137, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1662 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the court grants custody of the child to the state, it is placing him in the care of surrogate parents who exercise parental authority, not penal authority; accordingly the right to bail guaranteed to adults, on whom the state cannot impose parental authority, is inapplicable to the family court detention decision. Morris v. D'Amario, 416 A.2d 137, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1662 (R.I. 1980).</p>

Perez, 605 A.2d 1305, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 69 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although nearly 18 months elapsed from the date of a defendant’s arrest until the start of his trial, and such delay was sufficient to be presumptively prejudicial, the lack of any prejudice to the defendant as a result of the delay weighed against his claim that the state violated his speedy-trial right. State v. Austin, 643 A.2d 798, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 189 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant’s state and federal constitutional rights to a speedy trial were violated, requiring vacating of conviction for a possession-of-a-firearm charge that was brought to trial almost 11 years after the defendant’s indictment. State v. Powers, 643 A.2d 827, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 201 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For speedy trial purposes, “the line that demarks the ‘presumptively prejudicial’ boundary may be drawn at 12 months. State v. Powers, 643 A.2d 827, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 201 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant was deprived of his right to a speedy trial since the delay lasted five years and was primarily attributable to the negligence of the state. State v. DeAngelis, 658 A.2d 7, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 136 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although more than five years passed between the defendant’s indictment and the trial, most of that delay was attributable to the defendant’s voluntary and unlawful absence from the state. Accordingly, the trial court found, with no objection from the defendant, that the new speedy trial clock began to run when the defendant was returned to this state. Based on this finding, the length of delay was less than twelve months and, therefore, not presumptively prejudicial, eliminating the requirement to consider the remaining three <i>Barker v. Wingo, </i>407 U.S. 514, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972) factors. State v. Bleau, 668 A.2d 642, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 296 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant’s single request to counsel for a speedy trial following the defendant’s extended unlawful absence from the state is clearly insufficient to qualify as an assertion of the right to a speedy trial. State v. Bleau, 668 A.2d 642, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 296 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the primary reason for a one and a half year delay between the defendant’s arrest and the start of his trial was court congestion, since some of the delay was due to the fact that the defendant was tried during that time for two other cases that occurred within the same time-frame, and some was due to minor delays attributable to the defendant, the bulk of the delay being attributable to the state was weighted less heavily in a determination of the defendant’s right to a speedy trial because the delay was the product of crowded calendars and not deliberate conduct. State v. Austin, 731 A.2d 678, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since, over the course of a year and a half, defendant never requested a speedy trial, but waited until ten months after his arrest to move to dismiss the charges, renewing this motion five months later, defendant’s efforts fell short of indicating a real desire to invoke his constitutional rights and proceed to trial. State v. Austin, 731 A.2d 678, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since defendant suffered no prejudice resulting from pre-trial incarceration or disruption of his life, as he was already being held for other crimes committed during a robbery spree, since he presented no evidence in support of his contention that he suffered extraordinary anxiety, and since he made no showing of how the delay in bringing him to trial affected his ability to mount a defense, the defendant suffered no actual prejudice from the delay, and the trial justice correctly denied his motion to dismiss for want of a speedy trial. State v. Austin, 731 A.2d 678, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where review of the lack of speedy trial assertions by the defendant revealed that the primary reason that it took 21 months for him to arrive at the courtroom door was because of his difficulty in dealing with his various court-appointed counsel was of his own choosing and fault, there was no violation of his right to a speedy trial. State v. Austin, 742 A.2d 1187, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 228 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not denied a speedy trial since, although the state moved for and obtained several continuances, it was not primarily responsible for causing the long delays, most of which were attributable to the defendant’s churning through the seven attorneys who represented him. State v. Verrecchia, 766 A.2d 377, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 46 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court’s denial of defendant’s motion to dismiss charges against him, pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 12, based on an alleged violation of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 13-13-2, was properly denied where trials would have been commenced within the 180-day period except that continuances were required, which were found to be both necessary and reasonable; accordingly, denial of dismissal for violation of the Act and for an alleged violation of his right to a speedy trial, under R.I. Const. art. I, § 10, was proper. State v. Werner, 831 A.2d 183, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 145 (R.I. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1123, 124 S. Ct. 1083, 157 L. Ed. 2d 921, 2004 U.S. LEXIS 356 (2004).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err by failing to recognize defendant’s remarks at the commencement of his trial as a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial as no such motion was articulated for the trial justice to have made a ruling on, and defendant’s counsel made no such motion. As a result, defendant’s issue on appeal that the trial court erred by denying his <i>pro se </i>motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial was deemed unpreserved for appellate review. State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 2 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Application of the four-factor <i>Barker </i>speedy trial test showed that defendant was not denied the right that defendant had under U.S. Const. amend. VI and R.I. Const. art. I, § 10. In particular, defendant did not show that he made an explicit request for a speedy trial or that defendant was prejudiced by the 25-month delay between the filing of charges and the start of defendant’s trial. State v. Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 115 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to dismiss an indictment on speedy trial grounds; as much of the 14-year delay between the applicant’s arrest and his extradition to Rhode Island was attributable to his flight from the state and his attempts to fight extradition, such a motion would have been denied. Bido v. State, 56 A.3d 104, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 152 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Retrial.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not prejudiced by a delay of 67 months between the reversal of his first conviction and his retrial, where defendant acquiesced in the delay attributable to a codefendant, obtained another delay owing to his fear of improper publicity, and did not generally show an aggressive assertion of his right to a speedy trial. State v. Nordstrom, 529 A.2d 107, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 531 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated, even though the 45-month delay between the vacation of the conviction from defendant’s first trial and the commencement of his retrial was presumptively prejudicial, where the primary reasons for the delay were defendant’s first attorney’s unpreparedness for trial and his second attorney’s reasonable trial preparation efforts. In addition, both attorneys failed to assert defendant’s speedy trial rights, defendant acquiesced in the first 17 months of the delay, and he failed to show prejudice. State v. Oliveira, 127 A.3d 65, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 113 (R.I. 2015).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Waiver of Rights.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The determination of whether statements made during custodial interrogation are admissible against the accused is to be made upon an inquiry into the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation in order to ascertain whether the accused in fact knowingly and voluntarily decided to waive his rights to remain silent and to have the assistance of counsel.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Usually, in the absence of coercive pressures, a court will find a waiver of an accused’s right to counsel and privilege against self-incrimination if the defendant was informed of his rights, as required by Miranda, indicated that he understood them, and then voluntarily made a statement.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where on cross-examination a prosecution witness invoked his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination, any claim that defendant was deprived of his right of confrontation was waived by defendant’s failure to move that the witness’ direct testimony be stricken.

State v. Burbine, 451 A.2d 22, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1013 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s conviction for sexual assault was reversed where the defendant was denied his right to counsel because his supposed waiver of that right was not established; the court failed to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>make sure that the record revealed that the defendant’s waiver of his right to counsel was not merely voluntary, but was also knowing and intelligent. The evidence showed that: (1) the defendant did not know that his decision to fire his privately retained attorney just before trial would be construed as a waiver of his right to counsel; (2) he was denied a continuance to seek new counsel; (3) the court rebuffed the prosecutor’s suggestion that the court inquire into defendant’s ability to represent himself; and (4) the defendant strenuously objected to proceeding to trial on a pro se basis, even with standby counsel, and he insisted that he was not acting as his own attorney. State v. Bluitt, 850 A.2d 83, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 106 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant clearly waived his right to counsel under both U.S. Const. amend. VI and R.I. Const. art. 1, § 10 where he rejected eight court appointed attorneys before deciding to proceed pro se with stand by counsel in his criminal trial. The trial court’s rejection of his request during trial to seek private counsel was not an inhibition of his right to counsel. State v. Gordon, 880 A.2d 825, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 173 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s statements to police regarding a killing that occurred while defendant was engaged in a gang fight were voluntary because defendant was advised of defendant’s Miranda rights, defendant’s guardian was present during the interview and allowed to converse with defendant privately at several points during the interview, defendant did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and a detective testified that no one made any promises to defendant or otherwise coerced defendant into waiving defendant’s Miranda rights.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although defendant’s waiver of counsel was voluntary, because the magistrate did not undertake steps that would satisfy the magistrate that defendant appreciated the burdens, dangers, and downside risks of self-representation, the waiver was not knowingly and intelligently made.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived the defendant’s right to counsel by demanding removal of three successive counsel appointed to represent the defendant, and repeatedly and forcefully insisting on the right to self-representation, with full explanation by the court of the defendant’s rights and the consequences of waiver.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s right to counsel was not violated when the trial court allowed her to represent herself at trial because the record established her voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of her right to counsel. The lengthy colloquies between the trial court and defendant showed that her decision to waive counsel was a product of her own free will, the trial court made defendant aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, and the record was devoid of any concern raised in the colloquy as to her mental competency.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in finding that defendant voluntarily waived counsel without the trial court first independently inquiring into defendant’s indigency status, after the Public Defender’s office had found him ineligible; defendant continuously said he had funds to hire counsel, even after claiming he was indigent but was deemed ineligible for Public Defender representation, and R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-15-9, which defines eligibility requirements for indigent representation, does not expressly mandate or permit a trial justice to review the Public Defender’s finding of ineligibility. Moreover, defendant’s continuous failure to obtain representation demonstrated a voluntary waiver of counsel. State v. Souto, 210 A.3d 409, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 96 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Despite defendant’s claims that he was forced to proceed to trial without counsel, defendant’s continuous failure to obtain representation demonstrated a voluntary waiver of counsel; defendant repeatedly represented that he was able to afford counsel but that he was not comfortable with the retainer payment system, and he was generously granted more than 10 continuances over the course of 14 months, yet he still failed to procure representation.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in finding that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel because (1) defendant was told of the seriousness of the situation, (2) defendant’s alleged lack of understanding that he would have to proceed pro se if he did not hire counsel did not show a constitutionally inadequate waiver, (3) the appellate court deferred to the trial justice’s finding that defendant intentionally manipulated the proceedings, (4) defendant’s mental competency was not at issue, (5) defendant’s technical legal knowledge did not have to be assessed, and (6) defendant was clearly warned of the dangers of proceeding pro se.

State v. Andrews, 120 R.I. 771, 390 A.2d 926, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 723 (1978).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Cautionary instructions must (1) identify the prosecutor’s conduct as improper, (2) unequivocally indicate that the jury must disregard it, and (3) unequivocally indicate that since the defendant has no duty to present witnesses or any other evidence, his failure to do so cannot be construed as an admission that the evidence, if produced, would have been adverse. State v. Taylor, 425 A.2d 1231, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1043 (R.I. 1981).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining whether to admit inculpatory statements allegedly obtained in violation of constitutional guarantees, the trial justice must first conduct a preliminary hearing out of the jury’s presence in which the state must show by clear and convincing evidence that the statements were obtained in a constitutional manner; and if the trial justice admits the evidence, he must specifically instruct the jury that before it may consider the evidence, it must first determine beyond any reasonable doubt that the inculpatory statements were not obtained in violation of the defendant’s constitutional guarantees.

<p class="p6"><b>Evidence, Silence of Defendant.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The doctrine that, after <i>Miranda </i>warnings have been given by a police officer, the state may not present evidence of a defendant’s silence is not applicable when a defendant’s silence is in response to questions from a person who is not a police officer or otherwise acting in an official law enforcement capacity. State v. Martinez, 651 A.2d 1189, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 294 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>After a police officer made an unsolicited remark that defendant remained silent after he had been informed of his Miranda rights, the trial court did not err in refusing to declare a mistrial, as it immediately provided the jury with a thorough curative instruction that foreclosed any prejudice to defendant that may have arisen. State v. Enos, 21 A.3d 326, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 88 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Invocation of Right.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even if defendant had requested to speak with his aunt or mother prior to interrogation, such requests would not have served to invoke his right to remain silent or his right to counsel. State v. Benton, 413 A.2d 104, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1517 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is nothing inherent in a request for a probation officer that requires the finding that a juvenile’s request to see one necessarily constitutes an expression of the juvenile’s right to remain silent.

<p class="p6"><b>— Waiver.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whether a defendant waived his rights voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently is a question to be decided by the trial justice initially, and the burden is on the state to establish such waiver by clear and convincing evidence. State v. Benton, 413 A.2d 104, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1517 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The determination of whether statements made during custodial interrogation are admissible against the accused is to be made upon an inquiry into the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation in order to ascertain whether the accused in fact knowingly and voluntarily decided to waive his rights to remain silent and to have the assistance of counsel. State v. Benton, 413 A.2d 104, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1517 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When an accused voluntarily chooses to testify in his own behalf, the prosecution has the right to cross-examine him in respect to such testimony with the same latitude as would be exercised in the case of an ordinary witness regarding the circumstances connecting him with the alleged crime. State v. Wallace, 428 A.2d 1070, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1106 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where prosecution’s cross-examination of the defendant had ceased, but the trial court allowed a reopening of such cross-examination to allow the prosecution to impeach the defendant with prior convictions, this was not tantamount to calling defendant as the state’s witness nor was it an abuse of the trial court’s discretion. State v. Wallace, 428 A.2d 1070, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1106 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Admissions made pursuant to a good-faith contingent plea agreement are voluntary when the defendant is fully informed of his rights prior to his testifying, when there exists no evidence that the state falsely induced the statements, and when the defendant makes a free and rational choice to speak. State v. Malone, 568 A.2d 1378, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 2 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As defendant was orally apprised of his Miranda rights and initialed a form to acknowledge his understanding of those rights, the surreptitious recording of his statement after he said he preferred that it not be recorded did not render his waiver of his rights unknowing and unintelligent. State v. Musterd, 56 A.3d 931, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 133 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Noncustodial Questioning.</b></p>

<p class="p6"><b>Preservation for Review.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When defendant claimed it was error to deny defendant’s motion to suppress defendant’s confession since the confession was the fruit of an illegal arrest, whether defendant’s arrest was based on probable cause, under U.S. Const. amend. IV and R.I. Const. art. I, § 6 was not preserved because defendant said the confession was obtained contrary to R.I. Const. art. I, §§ 10 and 13 and U.S. Const. amends. V and VI. State v. Chum, 54 A.3d 455, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 131 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Voluntariness of Confession.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Both the Rhode Island and the federal Constitutions bar the use in a criminal trial of a defendant’s involuntary statements. The determination of voluntariness must be made on the basis of all facts and circumstances, including the behavior of the defendant and the behavior of the interrogators; the ultimate test is whether the defendant’s statements were the product of free and rational choice or a result of coercion that had overcome the defendant’s will at the time he confessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>State v. Griffith, 612 A.2d 21, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 158 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A confession obtained by direct or implied promises resulting from improper influence is involuntary, and the state bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the confession was voluntary. However, the statements made by the investigating officers to the defendant did not amount to constitutionally impermissible police tactics even though the officers told the defendant that they did not want to hear any more denials from him and that the crime he committed “could happen to anybody.” State v. Griffith, 612 A.2d 21, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 158 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in suppressing defendants’ alleged confessions on grounds that the transcripts of their tape-recorded statement were of doubtful authenticity, as the issue at the suppression hearing was not whether the confessions were admissible under the rules of evidence, but whether they were voluntary, and the State proved that they were. State v. Forbes, 900 A.2d 1114, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 113 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in suppressing defendants’ confessions, as testimony that an officer was alone with them during the interviews, that he was unarmed, that he made neither promises nor threats, and that they signed forms acknowledging their understanding of the officer’s <i>Miranda </i>warnings, proved by clear and convincing evidence that they gave their statements voluntarily. State v. Forbes, 900 A.2d 1114, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 113 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s confession was properly not suppressed as a hearing justice did not credit defendant’s testimony that the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families threatened to take defendant’s children if defendant did not give a police statement; defendant voluntarily waived defendant’s right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, and R.I. Const. art. I, § 13 when defendant made incriminating statements to the detectives at the police station. State v. Gonzalez, 986 A.2d 235, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 8 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to suppress his confession because it found that any delay in presentment under R.I. Super.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Miranda violations do not taint the admissibility of physical evidence that is the product of an unwarned and inadmissible statement, so long as that statement is voluntary.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Law enforcement’s failure to comply with Miranda did not taint the admissibility of evidence that was the product of an unwarned and inadmissible statement because the statement was not coerced, in violation of R.I.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Department of environmental management’s action to enforce a penalty pursuant to a consent agreement is analogous to a motion to adjudge a litigant in civil contempt for violation of an order having the force of law, and does not give rise to a right to trial by jury, where the only question is whether the consent order has been violated.

<p class="p6"><b>— Equity Cases.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice’s decision to rule on an undue influence claim in equity and disregard the jury’s verdict in favor of plaintiffs did not deprive them of their constitutional right to a trial by jury, because the revocable inter vivos trust at issue had to receive the same treatment in equity as a trust, and there was no state constitutional right to a jury trial in an equitable matter.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The determination of whether to issue injunctive relief and enforce the same by a contempt order is one that is traditionally made by a justice in furtherance of equitable power without the intervention of a jury.

<p class="p6"><b>Election of Civil Officers.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former R.I. Const. Amend., Art. VII, § 1, did not apply to fire districts, which are considered quasi-public corporations, as the term “civil officers” primarily if not solely related to municipal and state officers. Wood v. Quimby, 20 R.I. 482, 40 A. 161, 1898 R.I. LEXIS 97 (1898).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An act which required a vote for one person only for office of town councilman, the five candidates receiving highest number of votes to be elected, would restrict the right of qualified voters to vote in the election of all civil officers, in violation of former R.I. Const., Art. II, § 1, and former R.I. Const. Amend., Art. VII, § 1. In re Opinion of Judges, 21 R.I. 579, 41 A. 1009 (1898).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former R.I. Const. Amend., Art. VII, § 1, did not guarantee to every elector the right to vote for all civil officers, but only guaranteed the right to vote for those civil officers elected by the people. In re Election of Sch. Comm., 28 R.I. 629, 72 A. 417, 1903 R.I. LEXIS 137 (1903).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Hare system for election of city council consisting of nine members, so that each elector would vote for only one member, would violate former R.I. Const. Amend., Art. XX, § 1, since it was mandatory upon the legislature to accord each elector the right to vote for each elective officer. Opinion to Governor, 62 R.I. 316, 6 A.2d 147, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 36 (1939).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “all” in the clause “shall have a right to vote in the election of all civil officers” in former R.I. Const. Amend., Art. XX, § 1, meant that an elector had the right to vote for all officers subject to election and he could not be limited by the legislature to voting for only one officer. Opinion to Governor, 62 R.I. 316, 6 A.2d 147, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 36 (1939).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As qualified electors have the right to vote for all officers to be elected, the legislature is not permitted to deny a qualified elector the right to vote for the candidate of his choice for every elective office to be filled and the pairing system cannot be reconciled with the constitutional requirement of this amendment. Chase v. Burns, 114 R.I. 485, 335 A.2d 334, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1442 (1975).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Property Ownership.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since fire protection is a governmental function, voting restriction granting franchise only to land owners set forth in a legislative charter of a fire district must be shown to be necessary to promote a compelling state interest. Flynn v. King, 433 A.2d 172, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1239 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No compelling state interest was promoted by denying franchise to otherwise qualified voters who did not own property in a local fire district and thus the legislative charter of the fire district denied equal protection to certain qualified voters and was invalid. Flynn v. King, 433 A.2d 172, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1239 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Qualifications of Electors.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under former R.I. Const. Amend., Art. VII, § 1, a voter who had resided in a town for more than six months prior to an election and who filed a certificate of registration issued by the town clerk of another town in the state within the year last passed, should have been placed on the voting list of the town not only for general elections but also for elections of town officers. In re Voter's Certificate, 19 R.I. 726, 37 A. 810, 1896 R.I. LEXIS 91 (1896).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where name of naturalized citizen was placed on voting list and he was permitted to vote for office of councilman, such citizen was a qualified elector for the office within the meaning of former R.I. Const., Art. IX, § 1, and former R.I. Const. Amend., Art VII, § 1, where he was otherwise qualified but failed to file proof of citizenship as required by G.L. 1909, ch. 7, § 2 [former § 17-9-9], and election of such citizen to office of councilman would not be set aside. Bryer v. Sevigney, 42 R.I. 187, 106 A. 155, 1919 R.I. LEXIS 20 (1919).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In order to be “a qualified elector” for “civil office” the holder of a state civil office must be eligible to vote in a state election and the holder of a local civil office in a local election, and this eligibility requirement extends to the holder of civil office and not to the holders of other type of governmental positions. Advisory Opinion to Senate, 108 R.I. 551, 277 A.2d 750, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1305 (1971).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Effect on Residency Requirements.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This amendment does not nullify the senatorial district residency requirement of § 17-23-4, and therefore a state senator’s conviction under § 17-23-10 for registering a voter in violation of that requirement was not invalid. State v. Woodcock, 118 R.I. 296, 373 A.2d 803, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1458 (1977).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Residence and Home.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “residence” as used in former R.I. Const., Art. II, §§ 1 and 2, meant the domicile or home of the elector rather than his place of actual habitation or abode, so that an elector who temporarily changed his place of abode to another city did not lose his right to vote or hold office in the city in which he maintained his residence. State ex rel. Goldsworthy v. Aldrich, 14 R.I. 171, 1883 R.I. LEXIS 28 (1883).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The standard to ascertain an elector’s qualification as to his “residence and home” was not that of mere residence or actual place of abode, without more, but his voting domicile. In re Opinion of Justices, 65 R.I. 451, 16 A.2d 331, 1940 R.I. LEXIS 139 (1940).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The abandonment by an elector of his voting domicile is a matter of his intent, to be established by proper proof, with the burden of proof on the one challenging the elector’s qualification, since it is easier to establish a domicile than to prove abandonment. In re Opinion of Justices, 65 R.I. 451, 16 A.2d 331, 1940 R.I. LEXIS 139 (1940).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Knowledge by the board of canvassers of the mere change by an otherwise qualified elector of his residence to another city or town within six months of an election, so that he is unable to qualify to vote in his new residence, without proof of intent to change his voting domicile, is not of itself sufficient to authorize canvassers to strike him from qualified elector list on grounds of abandonment of voting domicile. In re Opinion of Justices, 65 R.I. 451, 16 A.2d 331, 1940 R.I. LEXIS 139 (1940).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Question of Eligibility.</b></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even if a prohibition in Rhode Island’s constitution against acceptance of appointments by other governments had still applied to judges, it would not have applied to bar the chief justice from accepting an appointment to a military review panel as part of the federal government’s war on terror, because application of the prohibition would have violated the supremacy clause.

Therefore, whether the General Assembly’s inclusion of chiefs of police as members of local police bargaining units violates this section must be evaluated in light of a particular chief ’s powers, responsibilities, policy-making authority, and the extent of that chief ’s actual involvement in employment negotiations.

<p class="p6"><b>Constitutional Criteria.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In order for an interim reapportionment plan of the Rhode Island State Senate to pass constitutional muster, it must meet two basic criteria; the one-person, one-vote requirement of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution and the Rhode Island constitutional mandate in this amendment that each senate district be as compact as possible and not the result of a political gerrymander. Farnum v. Burns, 561 F. Supp. 83, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19320 (D.R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Compact” as used in R.I. Const. art. VIII, § 1 referred to more than geography for purposes of determining that it was met by the redistricting plan encompassed within R.I. Gen. Laws § 22-1-2; compactness was determined by a qualitative approach with the goal of maintaining effective representation in the districts, and factors considered included contiguity, political gerrymandering, communities of interest, geographical, natural, historical, and political boundary concerns, and functional compactness. Parella v. Montalbano, 899 A.2d 1226, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 104 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an overall deviation in population in challenged Senate districts as a result of redistricting under R.I. Gen. Laws § 22-1-2 was less than 10 percent, the actual deviations were de minimis for purposes of a claim by voters and residents that the redistricting resulted in invidious discrimination under U.S. Const. amend. XIV so as to require justification by Rhode Island; there was no equal protection violation shown and no extremely close violation for purposes of finding the redistricting legislation unconstitutional under the compactness requirement of R.I. Const. art. VIII, § 1. Parella v. Montalbano, 899 A.2d 1226, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 104 (R.I. 2006).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Proposed legislation transferring full prosecutorial authority to a special prosecutor appointed by a member of the judicial branch of government severely infringes upon the fundamental powers of the attorney general.

<p class="p6"><b>Advisory Nature of Opinion.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Opinions of the supreme court under this section are merely advisory opinions. In re Opinion to Governor, 41 R.I. 209, 103 A. 513 (1918); In re Opinion of Justices, 51 R.I. 322, 154 A. 647, 1931 R.I. LEXIS 46 (1931); DiPrete v. Vallone, 70 R.I. 286, 38 A.2d 769, 1944 R.I. LEXIS 58 (1944).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the supreme court has been requested to given written opinion upon questions involving the scope of the authority of the registrar of motor vehicles to revoke or suspend the license of the operator of a motor vehicle under the provisions of §§ 31-11-15, 31-11-17, 31-11-18, 31-11-21 and 31-11-25 (see now §§ 31-11-6, 31-11-7 and 31-11-15) and where the court found that all basic questions were directly or indirectly involved in litigation pending in the superior court such court could decline to express any opinion at the time upon the questions propounded, however the attorney-general could obtain a certification of such questions for the court’s determination whereupon the court would have the benefit of briefs and arguments by adversary counsel and its determination would not be a mere advisory opinion but a binding decision having the force and effect of law. Opinion to Governor, 88 R.I. 392, 149 A.2d 341, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 24 (1959); Opinion to House of Representatives, 88 R.I. 396, 149 A.2d 343, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 25 (1959).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An advisory opinion would not constitute a decision of the supreme court, would not finally determine a question and would have no binding effect upon any person whose legal rights might be involved, but, on the other hand, a final decision and determination of the question would result if it were properly brought before the court in a litigated case. Opinion to Governor, 88 R.I. 392, 149 A.2d 341, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 24 (1959); Opinion to House of Representatives, 88 R.I. 396, 149 A.2d 343, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 25 (1959).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In performing the constitutional function of rendering a purely advisory opinion, the supreme court judges do not speak ex cathedra, from the chair of judgment, but only as consultors somewhat like the jurisconsults under the Roman law, it not being an exercise of supreme court’s judicial power. Opinion to Governor, 93 R.I. 262, 174 A.2d 553, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 129 (1961).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provision of this section is mandatory, when the inquiry falls within the purview thereof; however, it does not obligate the judges of the supreme court as the judicial department of the state but rather in their capacity as individual judges of the court; and, therefore, action pursuant thereto does not constitute an exercise of the judicial power. Opinion to Governor, 96 R.I. 358, 191 A.2d 611, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 141 (1963).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provision of this section requires that an opinion given on a question of law be exclusory in effect and intends to exclude opinions which involve directly or indirectly an exercise of the fact-finding power of the supreme court. Opinion to Governor, 96 R.I. 358, 191 A.2d 611, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 141 (1963).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the judges of the supreme court have given advisory opinions on questions of law, out of concern for the common good, to the co-ordinate branches of government, that relate only indirectly to the consistency with pertinent constitutional provisions, they scrupulously avoided violation of the principle of separation of powers, because of a conviction that this doctrine is not an absolute bar to enlarging the area of advisory opinions, but such a liberal application of this section is not intended to substitute the advisory opinion for litigation in order to obtain rulings upon the effect of law whether enacted or proposed. Opinion to Governor, 96 R.I. 358, 191 A.2d 611, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 141 (1963).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While an advisory opinion rendered by the supreme court is entitled to respect, it is advisory only and is without weight as a legal precedent. Romeo v. Cranston Redevelopment Agency, 105 R.I. 651, 254 A.2d 426, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 802 (1969).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is settled that in giving advisory opinions the Supreme Court will not give opinions which require directly or indirectly, an exercise of the fact-finding power of the court, inasmuch as the justices of this court, in so doing, are acting as individuals and not exercising the judicial power of the state. Advisory Opinion to the Governor, 113 R.I. 586, 324 A.2d 641, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1213 (1974).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Clarity of Question.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An opinion of the judges of the supreme court should be given only in response to a question so clearly stated that there can be no possibility of creating confusion. Opinion to Senate, 87 R.I. 56, 137 A.2d 527, 1958 R.I. LEXIS 4 (1958).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the circumstances it was deemed unwise to venture an opinion as to whether a proposed bill was a proper delegation of the powers of the general assembly when the supreme court justices had not been informed of the full contents of the proposed bill and also as to what provisions of the state constitution that were giving the representatives concern regarding the validity of the bill. Opinion to House of Representatives, 93 R.I. 465, 176 A.2d 393, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 3 (1962).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provision of this section requires that an opinion given on questions of law be exclusory in effect primarily to exclude opinions given on questions of law that do not challenge the consistency of law, enacted or proposed, with pertinent constitutional provisions. Opinion to Governor, 96 R.I. 358, 191 A.2d 611, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 141 (1963).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where questions propounded are of mixed fact and law, they are not within the purview of this section, and the manner in which they can best be recast as questions of law involves decisions that the judges of the supreme court are not prepared to make; such decisions will best be made after due consideration of the scope of the judges’ authority to give advisory opinions and the value of such opinions on the rules of law contemplated in the questions when not given in the context of pertinent fact situations. Opinion to Governor, 96 R.I. 358, 191 A.2d 611, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 141 (1963).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Duty to Render Opinion.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since this section expressly imposes the duty on the judges of the supreme court to “give their written opinion upon any question of law whenever requested by the governor or by either house of the general assembly,” the court is obliged to respond even though its opinion may carry no mandate. Opinion to Governor, 93 R.I. 262, 174 A.2d 553, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 129 (1961).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Fact-Finding Power.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In rendering an advisory opinion, the Supreme Court cannot exercise its fact-finding power. In re Request for Advisory Opinion Regarding House Bill 83-H-5640, 472 A.2d 301, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 464 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Questions Reviewable.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court is constitutionally obligated to give advisory opinions to either House of the General Assembly only when the questions propounded concern the constitutionality of pending legislation, and to the Governor only when the questions propounded concern the constitutionality of existing statutes which require implementation by the chief executive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In re Advisory Opinion (Chief Justice), 507 A.2d 1316, 1986 R.I.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Supreme Court is required to respond to a governor’s request for an advisory opinion only when the question propounded concerns the constitutionality of existing statutes which require implementation by the chief executive, and when it has a bearing upon a present constitutional duty awaiting performance by that executive.

<p class="p6"><b>Refusal of Advisory Opinion.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a question does not direct attention of supreme court to any particular provisions of federal or state constitutions which might be impinged upon by proposed legislation if it is enacted into law, the supreme court would decline to render an advisory opinion on such question.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where questions propounded by the governor to the judges of supreme court concerning the qualification for the appointment of city manager had no relationship to the official duties of the coordinate branch propounding the questions and absent any standing either under the constitution or any statute to seek resolution of the doubts by the city council members through the governor, the giving of opinions would be grossly gratuitous and an inexcusable participation by the judges in the affairs of the municipality. Opinion to Governor, 109 R.I. 289, 284 A.2d 295, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1056 (1971).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where questions propounded by the House of Representatives were involved in litigation pending in the Superior Court, the Supreme Court chose to refrain from rendering an advisory opinion during the pendency of the litigation.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Supreme Court declined to give an advisory opinion regarding the constitutionality of two bills since the request failed to point to particular constitutional provisions that might be violated by the proposed legislation and therefore had too broad a sweep to fall within the purview of the court’s constitutional obligation to render advisory opinions. Advisory Opinion to House of Representatives, 468 A.2d 258, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1108 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The constitutional requirement that judges of the Supreme Court give their written opinion upon any question of law whenever requested by the governor or by either house of the general assembly is mandatory in nature when the inquiry falls within the purview thereof.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supreme Court refused the Governor’s request for an advisory opinion on the legality of proposed legislation involving a consolidated rental car facility planned by the state, because resolution of the issues would require it to engage in forbidden fact finding; it further held that filing of a lawsuit by an affected party would not always preclude it from rendering an advisory opinion.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a slip and fall suit against a city and the State, the State lacked standing to appeal the trial court’s grant of summary judgment to the city because, not having filed a cross-claim against the city, the State was not a “party aggrieved by a final judgment” within the meaning of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>R.I.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The home rule amendment altered the traditional rule that cities and towns were creatures of the legislature having no inherent right to self-government but deriving all of their authority and power from the legislature. Lynch v. King, 120 R.I. 868, 391 A.2d 117, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 735 (1978).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 11-45.1-2 and 31-45-5 did not preempt Providence, R.I., Code of Ordinances § 16-93, prohibiting loud noise in certain locations, because (1) the ordinance did not conflict with the statutes but, rather, furthered the policy of the general assembly as stated in the statutes by creating a specific standard for a particular set of devices in a specific area, (2) the general assembly did not intend to completely occupy the field of noise regulation, and (3) R.I. Const. art. 13 allowed local governments to regulate noise in residential areas. State ex rel. City of Providence v. Auger, 44 A.3d 1218, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 72 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court properly granted declaratory and injunctive relief to two businesses and their owners in their action against a town for preemption of its ordinance banning the sale of flavored tobacco products and prohibiting the providing of any tobacco products to anyone under the age of 21 because the town lacked authority under its home rule charter to enact the ordinance where the ordinance was preempted by state law, and, although the ordinance was enacted to protect public health and safety, it constituted legislation concerning a matter of statewide concern and, therefore, infringed upon the power of the State. K&amp;W Auto., LLC v. Town of Barrington, 224 A.3d 833, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 13 (R.I. 2020).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Municipal Budget Regulation.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because § 45-9-3 provides uniform regulation in each city or town whose financial instability produces a lowered bond rating and threatens imminent default on debt obligations, and is an act of general applicability to all cities and towns whose budgetary problems have statewide impact, it does not violate this article. Marran v. Baird, 635 A.2d 1174, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 4 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>No Surrender of State Sovereignty.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The sovereignty of the state in the matter of elections was not surrendered to those cities and towns which adopted a home rule charter nor was the sovereignty of the state with relation to the exercise of the police power transferred to such cities or towns. State v. Krzak, 97 R.I. 156, 196 A.2d 417, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 55 (1964).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Nothing in this provision prevents an arbitration board from amending the pension plans of policemen and firemen, for even though such power is vested in the city council by the city charter, the board acts pursuant to state legislation and the general assembly has the overriding power to legislate even on local matters so long as it does so in a general act affecting all cities and towns alike without affecting the form of local government.

<p class="p6"><b>Regulation of Hospitality Businesses.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ordinance requiring hospitality businesses to retain their predecessors’ employees for 90 days following a change in the ownership or management of certain hotels within a city did not exceed the city’s home rule authority because the ordinance addressed a matter of local concern by promoting the stability of the city’s hospitality and tourism businesses, the ordinance did not conflict with state law, and there was no evidence indicating how the ordinance would impact other communities. R.I. Hospitality Ass'n v. City of Providence, 775 F. Supp. 2d 416, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34821 (D.R.I.), aff'd, 667 F.3d 17, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 23915 (1st Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Regulation of Licenses.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Challenge to a city’s Price and Flavor Ordinances on tobacco sales, directed generally toward tobacco sales license-holders and regulating certain discounting and prohibiting certain flavored tobacco sales, based on the argument that the city lacked authority to regulate businesses through licensing schemes, failed because there had been no challenge to the local licenses scheme and thus, any such argument was not properly before the court. Nat'l Ass'n of Tobacco Outlets v. City of Providence, 731 F.3d 71, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 19928 (1st Cir. 2013).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Regulation of Sewers.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The town of Westerly has the inherent power to expand and maintain its sewer system. The power to regulate sewers is not a matter of statewide concern and the location of public drains and sewers in the town of Westerly is a purely local concern, as set out in its home rule charter. Westerly Residents for Thoughtful Dev. v. Brancato, 565 A.2d 1262, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 155 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Removal of City Manager.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In ruling on the basic question of whether “under the charter of the city of Newport and the law of the state of Rhode Island, the proceedings by which the respondents seek to remove the relater from his office of city manager for the city of Newport are quasi-judicial in nature,” such city charter having been adopted pursuant to the provisions of this article, the provisions of the charter would be controlling and such charter does not expressly require that the city manager may be removed only for cause shown nor can it be so construed in the light of this section under which counsel may suspend or remove only for cause shown any officer of the city elected by it, it being finally ruled not necessary to prefer charges against the city manager to effect his removal.

Newport v. Horton, 22 R.I. 196, 47 A. 312, 1900 R.I. LEXIS 86 (1900).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>P.L. 1901, ch. 894, § 9, providing for payment of salaries of police commissioners of city of Newport by the city, does not violate this section, since the general assembly has the right to control police, although their duties are confined to a certain locality, and the right to provide for payment of expenses of local police department out of local funds of the municipality. Horton v. City Council of Newport, 27 R.I. 283, 61 A. 759, 1905 R.I. LEXIS 88 (1905).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Legislature could withdraw right of city, through its mayor and aldermen, to appoint police and fire commissioners and a public service engineer, and could provide for a state-appointed board of public safety to serve these functions, since cities and towns have no inherent right of local government.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The power to regulate occupations and businesses by licensing provisions and by imposing licensing fee is an attribute of sovereignty. It is not an incident of municipal administration and may not be exercised by municipalities except where it is lawfully delegated to them in particular instances expressly or by necessary implication. This amendment does not either expressly or by necessary implication vest municipalities with such power. It clearly states that the intent thereof is to grant the right of self-government only in all local matters. The power to license is definitely not a local matter. Newport Amusement Co. v.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Fire Fighters’ Act making promotion a bargainable issue in collective bargaining is general in nature and, notwithstanding the broad sweep of the home rule article, applies equally to all cities and towns and supersedes a controverting home rule charter provision. City of Cranston v. Hall, 116 R.I. 183, 354 A.2d 415, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1263 (1976).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The officers’ bill of rights (§§ 42-28.6-1 — 42-28.6-15) does not violate the home rule article (R.I. Const., Art. 13), since police officers, while they may be appointed by an individual city or town, act for all the inhabitants of the state and not only for the residents of the appointing community and the statute applies to all cities and towns and does not affect their form of government.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The parameters of “local” and “general” legislation may be more clearly discerned with the aid of three variables. First, when it appears that uniform regulation throughout the state is necessary or desirable, the matter is likely to be within the state’s domain. Second, whether a particular matter is traditionally within the historical dominion of one entity is a substantial consideration. Third, and most critical, if the action of a municipality has a significant effect upon people outside the home rule town or city, the matter is apt to be deemed one of statewide concern. East Greenwich v. O'Neil, 617 A.2d 104, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 209 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission’s review of a municipal ordinance prohibiting the construction of a certain class of high voltage lines does not involve a coordinate branch of government exercising powers in violation of the separation of powers doctrine.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the home rule charter amendment to the state Constitution confers power on cities and towns to exercise their right of self-government in all local matters, the legislature retains the right to legislate on matters of statewide concern, as well as the power to act in relation to property located in cities and towns. Munroe v. Town of E. Greenwich, 733 A.2d 703, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 139 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Licenses and Franchises.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The granting of an exclusive franchise to operate a community antenna service in a town was the licensing of a business and the exercise of a power which has been reserved to the state.

<p class="p6"><b>Penalties.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This article does not purport to diminish the legislative power of the general assembly in matters of statewide application, therefore the home rule charter permitting the imposing of greater penalties than those provided by law was unconstitutional and invalid, it being an attempt to diminish the legislative power of the general assembly. State v. Krzak, 97 R.I. 156, 196 A.2d 417, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 55 (1964).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Police Officers’ Arbitration Act.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Given the Police Officers’ Arbitration Act’s uniform application, its negligible impact on the town’s form of government and the statewide collective importance of municipal police officers, the Act as applied in this case did not violate the town’s right to self-government as guaranteed by the Rhode Island Constitution. Town of Lincoln v. Lincoln Lodge No. 22, 660 A.2d 710, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 178 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Regulation of Power Lines.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Considering the need for uniformity in the area of public utility regulatory policy and the extra-territorial effect of a municipal ordinance regulating the installation of power lines, the town’s ordinance was impermissibly one of statewide character and the ordinance constituted an action ultra vires of the authority delegated by the town’s home rule charter. East Greenwich v. O'Neil, 617 A.2d 104, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 209 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Special Legislation Subject to Approval by Electors.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notwithstanding adoption of a home rule charter, the general assembly may legislate in local matters by special legislation directed to a particular city or town, subject to the condition that the act shall not become effective until it has been duly approved by a majority of the qualified electors thereof voting at a general or special election, and subject to the additional condition, where it involves imposition of a tax or expenditure of money by a town as distinguished from a city, that it must be submitted to and approved by town electors qualified to vote on taxes and money expenditures. Opinion to House of Representatives, 79 R.I. 277, 87 A.2d 693, 1952 R.I. LEXIS 44 (1952).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Provision for approval at a primary election of an act relating to payment of legal fees by Town of Westerly was unconstitutional under this article, since the article provides for such approval only at a general or special election.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because 85-H 6525 and 87-H 6883 both affect matters of local concern and were not submitted to the voters of the city of Newport as required by art. XIII, § 4, these acts are invalid and unenforceable. McCarthy v. Johnson, 574 A.2d 1229, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 104 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Two acts, 85-H 6525 and 87-H 6883, are not general acts applicable to all towns and cities. They directly affect a single community, the city of Newport, by raising the potential liability exposure for injuries sustained by this plaintiff. Clearly these two acts affect the “property, affairs and government” of the defendant city. McCarthy v. Johnson, 574 A.2d 1229, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 104 (R.I. 1990).</p>

(the act), allowing the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue (Director) to appoint a receiver to conduct a city’s affairs in a fiscal emergency, did not violate the home rule provisions of R.I. Const. art. XIII, § 4 because the act (1) was an enactment of general application, and (2) did not alter the city’s form of government in R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-9-7, as the receiver’s powers were contained and channeled by (1) standards setting forth a deliberate and progressive mechanism by which a town or city was provided with varying levels of support and control depending on the circumstances, (2) the Director’s ability, under R.I. Gen.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>On February 21, 1787, Congress adopted a resolution in favor of a convention to devise provisions to render the Constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigencies of the union.

On September 28, 1787, Congress ordered the Constitution submitted to conventions of the people of the various states.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>P.L. 1981, ch. 85, requiring the only nuclear fuel processing plant in the state to post a bond for 20 years to ensure adequate decontamination efforts and results, represents a permissible legislative initiative aimed at safeguarding a distinct and substantial public interest although limited to a class of one, and therefore is not invalid as a bill of attainder.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining whether a statute inflicts punishment and qualifies as a Bill of Attainder, three factors are relevant: (1) whether the challenged statute falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment; (2) whether the statute viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes; and (3) whether the legislative record evidences a legislative intent to punish. Section 42-116-40 does not rise to a Bill of Attainder because: (1) it does not limit a defendant’s access to the courts or right to contribution, it merely limits the right of the settling tortfeasor’s contribution; (2) it promotes settlements and decreases the litigation expenses incurred by taxpayers; and (3) the legislative history does not indicate that passage of the section was motivated solely to punish one party.

<p class="p4">Text</p>
<p class="p5">The executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America. He shall hold his office during the term of four years, and, together with the vice-president, chosen for the same term, be elected as follows:</p>
<p class="p5">Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress; but no senator or representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector.</p>
<p class="p5">The electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which list they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the president of the senate. The president of the senate shall, in the presence of the senate and house of representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the president, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the house of representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for president; and if no person have a majority, then from the five highest on the list the said house shall in like manner choose the president. But in choosing the president, the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. In every case, after the choice of the president, the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the vice-president. But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes, the senate shall choose from them by ballot the vice-president.</p>
<p class="p5">The congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the same throughout the United States.</p>
<p class="p5">No person except a natural-born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of president; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United States.</p>
<p class="p5">In case of the removal of the president from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the vice-president, and the congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or inability, both of the president and vice-president, declaring what officer shall then act as president, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a president shall be elected.</p>
<p class="p5">The president shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected; and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any of them.</p>
<p class="p5">Before he enters on the execution of his office, he shall take the following oath or affirmation:</p>
<p class="p5">“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The clause relating to oaths of office requires that the members of the state legislature, and all executive and judicial officers of the several states as well as those of the federal government shall take the oath to support the Constitution. Ableman v. Booth, 62 U.S. (21 How.) 506, 16 L. Ed. 169, 1858 U.S. LEXIS 676 (1859).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A succeeding state attorney-general cannot be substituted as defendant in a suit to restrain his predecessor from enforcing an unconstitutional statute in view of the oath of office required by this article. Ex parte La Prade, 289 U.S. 444, 53 S. Ct. 682, 77 L. Ed. 1311, 1933 U.S. LEXIS 974 (1933).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Prior Debts Valid Under Constitution.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provision as to debts prior to the adoption of the Constitution was inserted to meet a present emergency, and not to regulate the powers of government, and was indispensable if the Constitution was adopted. Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 15 L. Ed. 691, 1856 U.S. LEXIS 472 (1857).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Supreme Law.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a state law conflicts with a federal law and prevents accomplishment of the full congressional purpose, it must yield to the federal law. In re Grand Jury Investigation, 441 A.2d 525, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1166 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rhode Island statutes (former §§ 28-10-10, 28-10-12), making it a crime for an employer to utilize the services of a third party in recruiting or hiring workers to replace those who are engaged in a labor strike, have been preempted by the National Labor Relations Act and are therefore unconstitutional. Charlesgate Nursing Center v. Rhode Island, 723 F. Supp. 859, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12835 (D.R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 28-33-44, requiring an employer to continue providing health insurance coverage to an employee receiving workers’ compensation benefits for a two-year period, is preempted by provisions of the federal bankruptcy code giving priority to “allowed unsecured claims for contributions to employee benefit plans” which arose 180 days before the date of the filing of the petition and subject to a $2,000 per employee limit. In re National Bickford Foremost, Inc., 116 B.R. 351, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 1983 (Bankr. D.R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the proscription of the state Franchise Investment Act limits the statute’s application to one type of provision, venue clauses, in one type of agreement, franchise agreements, the lack of general applicability subjects it to preemption by federal statute. KKW Enters. v. Gloria Jean's Gourmet Coffees Franchising Corp., 184 F.3d 42, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 16671 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even without an express provision for preemption, state law must yield to a congressional statute where Congress intends that federal law should occupy the field and where state law is naturally preempted to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute. Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 120 S. Ct. 2288, 147 L. Ed. 2d 352, 2000 U.S. LEXIS 4153 (2000).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state is free to enact limitations on the type and amount of service for which members of the retirement system can purchase retirement credit, but federal law will preempt any state law that differentiates between those who receive a military pension and those who do not when offering former military personnel the opportunity to purchase retirement credit. Almeida v. Ret. Bd. of the R.I. Emples. Ret. Sys., 116 F. Supp. 2d 269, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14741 (D.R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because § 36-9-25(b) applies universally, regardless of whether an individual receives a military pension, it does not conflict with federal law and is not preempted by any federal statute. Almeida v. Ret. Bd. of the R.I. Emples. Ret. Sys., 116 F. Supp. 2d 269, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14741 (D.R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Conflict Between Federal Statutes.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The doctrine of preemption applies only to conflicts between federal provisions, on the one hand, and state or local provisions, on the other hand, and the proper mode of analysis for cases that involve a perceived conflict between two federal statutes is that of implied repeal. Rhode Island v. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 5487 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 919, 115 S. Ct. 298, 130 L. Ed. 2d 211, 1994 U.S. LEXIS 6990 (1994).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Constitution and Laws.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Laws of the United States when made in pursuance of the Constitution are the supreme law of the land. McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 4 L. Ed. 579, 1819 U.S. LEXIS 320 (1819), limited, Thomson v. Pacific Railroad, 76 U.S. 579, 19 L. Ed. 792, 1869 U.S. LEXIS 1001 (1869), limited, Central Pac. R.R. v. California, 162 U.S. 91, 16 S. Ct. 766, 40 L. Ed. 903, 1896 U.S. LEXIS 2196 (1896).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Among the matters which are implied, though not expressed in the Constitution, is that the nation may not in the exercise of its powers prevent a state from discharging the ordinary functions of government, just as it follows from the clause that no state can interfere with the free and unembarrassed exercise by the national government of all the powers conferred upon it. South Carolina v. United States, 199 U.S. 437, 26 S. Ct. 110, 50 L. Ed. 261, 1905 U.S. LEXIS 991 (1905).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This clause was not intended to be the means by which congress could compel a state to provide at its own expense courts for the enforcement of federal laws which such state deemed to be penal, and therefore unenforceable in its courts. Robinson v. Norato, 71 R.I. 256, 43 A.2d 467, 1945 R.I. LEXIS 48 (1945), disapproved, Testa v. Katt, 330 U.S. 386, 67 S. Ct. 810, 91 L. Ed. 967, 1947 U.S. LEXIS 2950 (1947).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Exclusion under § 16-7-20 of federal funds from the determination of local school district expenditures did not violate the supremacy clause; for although the federal program was intended to supplement and not substitute for state aid to local districts, the intent and effect of the exclusion was not to reduce state aid in proportion to federal funding, but only to assess the amount of local funding free of distortion by outside grants. Middletown School Committee v. Board of Regents for Education, 439 F. Supp. 1122, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13474 (D.R.I. 1977).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state’s authority to regulate interstate wholesale utility rates was preempted by congress’ enactment of the Federal Power Act, hence jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of the wholesale rate charged by the New England Power Company to the Narragansett Electric Company rests exclusively with the federal power commission. Narragansett Elec. Co. v. Burke, 119 R.I. 559, 381 A.2d 1358, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 2060 (1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 972, 98 S. Ct. 1614, 56 L. Ed. 2d 63, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 1507 (1978).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>P.L. 1981, ch. 85, requiring the state’s only nuclear fuel processing plant to post a bond for 20 years to ensure adequate decontamination efforts and results, represented a simultaneous attempt at regulation in an area preempted by federal law and is therefore invalid under the supremacy clause of this article. United Nuclear Corp. v. Cannon, 553 F. Supp. 1220, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9943 (D.R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since its enactment in November 1978, the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Reform Act has been widely and often construed by the federal courts, and where there is a federal statute with a substantial body of federal case law already established with respect to such issues that federal authority is controlling. Gambogi v. Capodalupo (In re Gambogi), 20 B.R. 587, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 3994 (Bankr. D.R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action by disgruntled workers, asserting a potpourri of claims arising out of a temporary change in the hours of duty policy which prevailed at their place of employment, was preempted by the elaborate remedial system of the federal Civil Service Reform Act. Tucker v. Defense Mapping Agency Hydrographic/Topographic Center, 607 F. Supp. 1232, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20331 (D.R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>— State Rules.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The United States attorney’s petition to amend Rule 3.8(f), Rules of Professional Conduct, which restricts the use of subpoenas to compel lawyers to provide evidence, was denied, where the federal district court in Rhode Island had adopted the rule and there was, therefore, no state interference because the state and federal courts were in harmony as to the proper ethical conduct of attorneys practicing in their respective courts. In re Petition of Almond, 603 A.2d 1087, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 41 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Treaties.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court is bound to take notice of a treaty, and will reverse an original decree of condemnation, and restore the property under a treaty made subsequent to the decree. United States v. Schooner Peggy, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 103, 2 L. Ed. 49, 1801 U.S. LEXIS 118 (1801).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A treaty may supersede a prior act of congress, and an act of congress may supersede a prior treaty. Cherokee Tobacco, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 616, 20 L. Ed. 227, 1870 U.S. LEXIS 1507 (1871).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While a treaty and an act of congress are placed on the same footing by the Constitution when they both relate to the same subject, and courts will construe them so as to give effect to both, if the two are inconsistent, the one last in date will control, providing the stipulations of the treaty are self-executing. Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U.S. 190, 8 S. Ct. 456, 31 L. Ed. 386, 1888 U.S. LEXIS 1852 (1888).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A treaty by the express words of this clause is binding alike on federal and state courts, and is capable of enforcement, and must be enforced in the litigation of private rights. Maiorano v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R., 213 U.S. 268, 29 S. Ct. 424, 53 L. Ed. 792, 1909 U.S. LEXIS 1872 (1909).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An affidavit was not invalid for failure to particularly describe the premises to be searched, where the allegations in the affidavit amply supported the inference drawn by the issuing justice that the entire dwelling unit and both occupants were involved in the storage of stolen drugs, and the issuing justice could infer on the basis of ordinary experience in the facts of life that a person engaged in the storage of a great quantity of stolen narcotics and related substances would not place it in a portion of a single-family dwelling house without having first taken the precaution of making a confederate of his tenant; in drawing these inferences from the affidavit, the justice was following the principal that affidavits for search warrants must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a common sense and realistic fashion.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the DEA agent had extensive training and expertise, her statements in the affidavit supporting the search warrant simply provided only generalized information regarding how drug traffickers operate; thus, the totality of the circumstances, as summarized within the four corners of the affidavit, did not give rise to a fair probability that the search of the particular location that the agent only presumed to be the suspected trafficker’s residence would uncover contraband.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a child pornography case in which the named subscriber of an IP address did not reside at the address listed in the warrant, nothing within the affidavit rose to the level of a knowing or intelligent false statement or one made with reckless disregard for the truth as the police were able to make a direct connection between the device using that IP address, the physical address listed in the warrant, and the downloaded child pornography; and, even if the name of the subscriber listed in the warrant affidavit was disregarded, there was probable cause for the search warrant, considering the information regarding the IP address, and the detective’s surveillance of the physical address. Thus, the family court magistrate properly denied the respondent juvenile’s request for a Franks hearing. In re Austin B., 208 A.3d 1178, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 85 (R.I. 2019).</p>

Veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge all remain “highly relevant” factors, closely intertwined with the commonsense, practical question whether there is “probable cause.” State v.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Warrant authorizing search and seizure of “evidence relating to the homicide of (name of victim),” which set forth an illustrative list of the types of evidence that would be sought and which was supported by a detailed affidavit, was not a “general warrant.” State v.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s motion to suppress evidence seized from his residence was properly denied, as a confidential informant’s tip that he was selling drugs from his apartment was corroborated, and this corroborated tip, combined with defendant’s recent sale of cocaine in a controlled buy, satisfied the probable cause requirement to support the search warrant.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Exigent circumstances occur when a reasonable officer believes that to delay acting to obtain a warrant would, in all likelihood, permanently frustrate an important police objective, such as to prevent the destruction of evidence relating to criminal activity or to secure an arrest before a suspect can commit further serious harm.

Once firefighters enter a building for this purpose, they may seize evidence of arson that is in plain view. An immediate threat that the blaze might rekindle also presents an exigency that justifies a warrantless and nonconsensual post-fire investigation. State v. Hoffman, 567 A.2d 1134, 1990 R.I.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Exigency created by an explosion and fire was still present when an official investigation began, where, even though rekindling did not appear to be imminent, legitimate concerns regarding additional structural collapse did persist at the time a fire inspector began his search of the premises.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since law enforcement officers’ relevant knowledge regarding a raccoon being kept as a pet in a residence was complete almost two hours before environmental management officers arrived to seize the animal, and since the officers on the scene were not motivated by an objective or subjective belief that the animal would be spirited away or that it was imminently dangerous, there were no exigent circumstances justifying an exception to the warrant requirement. Bilida v. McCleod, 41 F. Supp. 2d 142, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 585 (D.R.I. 1999), aff'd, 211 F.3d 166, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 9136 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>

United States v. D'Alo, 486 F. Supp. 945, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10552 (D.R.I. 1979).</p>

<p class="p6"><b>Double Jeopardy.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The prohibition of this amendment is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy, and the accused whether convicted or acquitted, is equally put in jeopardy after trial on the first offense. United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 16 S. Ct. 1192, 41 L. Ed. 300, 1896 U.S. LEXIS 2296 (1896).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where sentence of petitioner was to begin after expiration of prior sentence he was then erroneously thought to be serving and it was later discovered that he was not serving a prior sentence, a correction of the sentence four days later, when he was again brought before the court, did not constitute two sentences on one indictment and was not a violation of his constitutional rights under this provision. Sanford v. Langlois, 93 R.I. 1, 170 A.2d 283, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 69 (1961).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendants indicted for rape, kidnapping, sodomy and larceny pled nolo contendere pursuant to a plea bargain which provided for sentences on all four charges, and where trial judge first accepted, then revoked, the plea bargain and reinstated the not guilty pleas upon which the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of rape and kidnapping with sentences greater than those originally agreed upon in the plea bargain, upon remand by the supreme court with instructions to resentence in accordance with the original bargain, the sentencing judge could not impose the agreed-upon sentences for sodomy and larceny since defendants had been acquitted for those charges by the jury and to do so would violate the double jeopardy prohibitions of the Constitution. State v. Abbott, 117 R.I. 295, 366 A.2d 1135, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1627 (1976).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To determine whether a defendant being tried for the violation of two distinct statutory provisions which arose from the same act or transaction is being placed twice in jeopardy, the test to be applied is whether each statutory provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not. State v. Davis, 120 R.I. 82, 384 A.2d 1061, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 764 (1978); State v. Pope, 414 A.2d 781, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1640 (R.I. 1980), overruled in part, State v. Acquisto, 463 A.2d 122, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1012 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where appellants themselves have pressed for a mistrial, the double jeopardy clause bars a new trial only if it can be said that the government’s claimed error stemmed from bad faith, an effort to harrass or prejudice, or an attempt to provoke a mistrial. United States v. Zozlio, 617 F.2d 314, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 19534 (1st Cir. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Retrial would constitute double jeopardy where prosecutorial or judicial overreaching had caused the original mistrial. United States v. D'Alo, 486 F. Supp. 954, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10776 (D.R.I. 1980), disapproved, United States v. Motley, 655 F.2d 186, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 18136 (9th Cir. 1981); State v. Doyon, 416 A.2d 130, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1663 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A new information which was prompted by evidence developed a trial prior to a declaration of mistrial and which increased the potential for conviction could not be imposed in lieu of the original indictment, as it would have victimized the defendant significantly for having successfully pursued a legitmate trial tactic. United States v. D'Alo, 486 F. Supp. 954, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10776 (D.R.I. 1980), disapproved, United States v. Motley, 655 F.2d 186, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 18136 (9th Cir. 1981).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the same act or transaction constitutes the violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the applicable standard is found in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932) wherein the court stated, “where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.” State v. Anthony, 422 A.2d 921, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1852 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the meaning of a criminal statute is ambiguous, the policy of lenity in the construction of criminal statutes requires that the less harsh of two possible meanings be adopted. Its purpose is to prevent the pyramiding of sentences when the penalties have not been clearly authorized. State v. Anthony, 422 A.2d 921, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1852 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fifth amendment ban on double jeopardy is based upon the common-law pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict. Ventures Management Co. v. Geruso, 434 A.2d 252, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1254 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The concept of double jeopardy is wholly inapplicable to the issue of civil contempt. Ventures Management Co. v. Geruso, 434 A.2d 252, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1254 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The standard used for determining whether an accused is in danger of being twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense is that set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932), wherein the supreme court held that: “the applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.” State v.

<p class="p6"><b>— Interrogation.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Miranda safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent; that is, the term “interrogation” under Miranda refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating reponse from the suspect. Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 94 (1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Not all statements obtained by the police after a person has been taken into custody are to be considered the product of interrogation; rather, “interrogation” must reflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody itself.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was no “interrogation” within the meaning of Miranda where police officers transporting an arrested defendant to the station conversed briefly among themselves but within the defendant’s hearing about the need to find the murder weapon, believed to be located in the vicinity of a school for handicapped children; the fact that the officers’ comments struck a responsive chord in the defendant, who then located the shotgun for the police, did not decide the matter where it was not established that the police should have known that their words were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 94 (1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The definitions of “interrogation” under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, if indeed the term “interrogation” is even apt in the Sixth Amendment context, are not necessarily interchangeable since the policies underlying the two constitutional protections are quite distinct.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since <i>Miranda </i>warnings are necessary only when a suspect is in official custody, subject to questioning by law-enforcement officials, their agents, or agents of the court, the questioning of a student by a principal after a fight as part of the school’s policy to call students involved in fights to the principal’s office, and after a police officer had left the school grounds without asking the principal to speak to the student, did not render the principal an agent of law enforcement, and did not require that the student be informed of his rights prior to the questioning.

<p class="p6"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Denial of request that nurse be permitted to sit alongside defendant’s counsel during medical testimony was not a denial of any right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. State v. Carvalho, 122 R.I. 461, 409 A.2d 132, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1564 (1979).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The definitions of “interrogation” under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, if indeed the term “interrogation” is even apt in the Sixth Amendment context, are not necessarily interchangeable since the policies underlying the two constitutional protections are quite distinct. Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 94 (1980).</p>

<p class="p6"><b>Confronted With Witnesses.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This provision is not violated by reading in evidence on a second trial a transcribed copy of the stenographic notes of the reporter of the testimony of a witness who had died after the first trial. Mattox v. United States, 156 U.S. 237, 15 S. Ct. 337, 39 L. Ed. 409, 1895 U.S. LEXIS 2131 (1895), limited, Carver v. United States, 164 U.S. 694, 17 S. Ct. 228, 41 L.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An act of congress declaring that a judgment of conviction against the principal felons shall be evidence in the prosecution against the receiver that property of the United States was embezzled or stolen, violates this amendment. Kirby v. United States, 174 U.S. 47, 19 S. Ct. 574, 43 L. Ed. 890, 1899 U.S. LEXIS 1481 (1899).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The admission in evidence of a statement or deposition of a co-defendent taken at the examining trial violates the right of a defendant to be confronted with the witnesses against him where the failure of the witness to appear at the trial to testify in person is plainly due to the negligence of the prosecution. Motes v. United States, 178 U.S. 458, 20 S. Ct. 993, 44 L. Ed. 1150, 1900 U.S. LEXIS 1694 (1900).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Introduction of letters of persons not examined as witnesses did not constitute a denial of the right to be confronted with the witnesses where the accused had answered the letters. Salinger v. United States, 272 U.S. 542, 47 S. Ct. 173, 71 L. Ed. 398, 1926 U.S. LEXIS 22 (1926).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was charged with first degree murder of a woman, and his alleged accomplice, who had pleaded guilty to second degree murder of the same deceased, was permitted to testify against him, defendant had no standing to object by virtue of his sixth amendment right of confrontation, since the alleged accomplice testified in the presence of defendant who cross-examined him. State v. Espinosa, 109 R.I. 221, 283 A.2d 465, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1044 (1971).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an out-of-court statement referred to threats of future conduct of defendant, where the state of mind of the victim was placed in issue by the defense to show a friendly relationship between victim and defendant, and where defendant made no attempt to show whether the circumstances indicated the statement was reasonably trustworthy, there was no error in admitting the hearsay as rebuttal evidence. State v. Patriarca, 112 R.I. 14, 308 A.2d 300, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 955 (1973).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not deprived of right of confrontation by denial of his pretrial motion for severance where evidence of an out-of-court conversation implicating defendant was admitted at trial, defendant cross-examined one of the participants as to whether the statement had in fact been made, there were no circumstances rendering suspect the reliability of declarant’s statement, and statement was not devastatingly incriminating. State v. Patriarca, 112 R.I. 14, 308 A.2d 300, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 955 (1973); State v. Lerner, 112 R.I. 62, 308 A.2d 324, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 957 (1973).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that informer did not testify against defendant on drug charge did not deprive defendant of his right to confrontation where the informer was not the accuser and where state was unable to locate the informer. Frazier v. Howard, 112 R.I. 630, 314 A.2d 141, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1479 (1974).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s right to counsel was not violated when the trial court allowed her to represent herself at trial because the record established her voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of her right to counsel.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s motion to suppress statements he made to a Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF) investigator on grounds that his statements were involuntary and that his right to due process was violated was improperly granted because the investigator’s interview at defendant’s kitchen table was the antithesis of a coercive interrogation; there was no DCF policy requiring the investigator to give defendant the DCF brochure informing him of his right to counsel at the beginning of the interview, and it was not unconstitutional for the investigator to have waited until the end of the interview to give defendant the brochure; and defendant’s rights to counsel had not attached as he was not in custody and had not been charged with a crime.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Six-year delay between defendant’s arraignment and his trial for arson did not violate his right to a speedy trial, where defendant conducted discovery and sought nine separate continuances in the first two years after his arraignment and his counsel later made five additional motions to continue the proceedings.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial is to be assessed according to the four-part test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972). The elements of the four-part test include (1) length of the delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) the defendant’s assertion of the right, and (4) the prejudice to the defendant. State v.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although nearly 18 months elapsed from the date of a defendant’s arrest until the start of his trial, and such a delay was sufficient to be presumptively prejudicial, the lack of any prejudice to the defendant as a result of the delay weighed against his claim that the state violated his speedy-trial right. State v. Austin, 643 A.2d 798, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 189 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant’s state and federal constitutional rights to a speedy trial were violated, requiring vacating of his conviction for possession-of-a-firearm charge that was brought to trial almost 11 years after the defendant’s indictment.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant was deprived of his right to a speedy trial when the delay lasted five years and was primarily attributable to the negligence of the state. State v. DeAngelis, 658 A.2d 7, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 136 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although more than five years passed between the defendant’s indictment and the trial, most of that delay was attributable to the defendant’s voluntary and unlawful absence from the state. Accordingly, the trial court found, with no objection from the defendant, that the new speedy trial clock began to run when the defendant was returned to this state. Based on this finding, the length of delay was less than twelve months and, therefore, not presumptively prejudicial, eliminating the requirement to consider the remaining three <i>Barker v. Wingo, </i>407 U.S. 514, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972) factors. State v. Bleau, 668 A.2d 642, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 296 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant’s single request to counsel for a speedy trial following the defendant’s extended unlawful absence from the state is clearly insufficient to qualify as an assertion of the right to a speedy trial.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the primary reason for a one and a half year delay between the defendant’s arrest and the start of his trial was court congestion, but some of the delay was due to the fact that the defendant was tried during that time for two other cases that occurred within the same time-frame, and some was due to minor delays attributable to the defendant, the bulk of the delay being attributable to the state was weighted less heavily in a determination of the defendant’s right to a speedy trial because the delay was the product of crowded calendars and not deliberate conduct. State v. Austin, 731 A.2d 678, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, over the course of a year and a half, defendant never requested a speedy trial, but waited until ten months after his arrest to move to dismiss the charges, renewing this motion five months later, defendant’s efforts fell short of evidencing a real desire to invoke his constitutional rights and proceed to trial. State v. Austin, 731 A.2d 678, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant suffered no prejudice resulting from pre-trial incarceration or disruption of his life, as he was already being held for other crimes committed during a robbery spree, where he presented no evidence in support of his contention that he suffered extraordinary anxiety, and where he made no showing of how the delay in bringing him to trial affected his ability to mount a defense, the defendant suffered no actual prejudice from the delay, and the trial justice correctly denied his motion to dismiss for want of a speedy trial. State v. Austin, 731 A.2d 678, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not denied a speedy trial since, although the state moved for and obtained several continuances, it was not primarily responsible for causing the long delays, most of which were attributable to the defendant’s churning through the seven attorneys who represented him. State v. Verrecchia, 766 A.2d 377, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 46 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A defendant was more culpable than the state for causing a delay in his trial since he knew of his indictment, his initial court date, and the warrant for his arrest, yet still left the jurisdiction for 16 years, which was not merely negligent but willful and deliberate. State v. Crocker, 767 A.2d 88, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 70 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a defendant intentionally avoided returning to the jurisdiction to face charges that he knew or should have known were still pending against him, and was thus himself largely responsible for the delay in his eventual trial, any presumptive prejudice he may have suffered was insufficient by itself to support a finding that the state violated his right to a speedy trial.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err by failing to recognize defendant’s remarks at the commencement of his trial as a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial as no such motion was articulated for the trial justice to have made a ruling on, and defendant’s counsel made no such motion. As a result, defendant’s issue on appeal that the trial court erred by denying his pro se motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial was deemed unpreserved for appellate review. State v.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Application of the four-factor <i>Barker </i>speedy trial test showed that defendant was not denied the right that defendant had under U.S. Const. amend. VI and R.I. Const. art. I, § 10. In particular, defendant did not show that he made an explicit request for a speedy trial or that defendant was prejudiced by the 25-month delay between the filing of charges and the start of defendant’s trial. State v. Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 115 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to dismiss an indictment on speedy trial grounds; as much of the 14-year delay between the applicant’s arrest and his extradition to Rhode Island was attributable to his flight from the state and his attempts to fight extradition, such a motion would have been denied. Bido v. State, 56 A.3d 104, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 152 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Retrial.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not prejudiced by a delay of 67 months between the reversal of his first conviction and his retrial, where defendant acquiesced in the delay attributable to a codefendant, obtained another delay owing to his fear of improper publicity, and did not generally show an aggressive assertion of his right to a speedy trial. State v. Nordstrom, 529 A.2d 107, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 531 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated, even though the 45-month delay between the vacation of the conviction from defendant’s first trial and the commencement of his retrial was presumptively prejudicial, where the primary reasons for the delay were defendant’s first attorney’s unpreparedness for trial and his second attorney’s reasonable trial preparation efforts. In addition, both attorneys failed to assert defendant’s speedy trial rights, defendant acquiesced in the first 17 months of the delay, and he failed to show prejudice. State v.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that eleventh amendment immunity can be waived, and that courts have the discretion to raise eleventh amendment questions <i>sua sponte,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i> suggests that the amendment is just as much a grant of immunity, and thus a type of defense, as it is a limitation on the courts’ jurisdiction.

The dispositive factor is “ultimate state liability” which rests on the degree to which the organization is financially dependent upon the state, and the extent to which the organization performs a state obligation or function.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The housing authorities of cities, created by chapter 25 of title 45, are basically different from municipal corporations since they exercise both municipal and federal powers, have a dual public and private character, and are not created for political purposes nor strictly as instruments of the government for its own uses or subject to its complete control; therefore, such housing authorities are persons within the meaning of this amendment and as such have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a state statute under the due process and equal protection clauses.

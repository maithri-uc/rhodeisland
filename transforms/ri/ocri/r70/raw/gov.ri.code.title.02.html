<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8">Whereas it is recognized that freshwater wetlands, buffers, floodplains, and other areas that may be subject to storm flows and flooding as defined in this chapter provide storage and absorption areas for flood waters which reduce flood hazards; and</p>
<p class="p8">Whereas all flood plains for all rivers, streams, and other water courses are certain to be overflowed with water periodically in spite of all reasonable efforts to prevent those occurrences; and</p>
<p class="p8">Whereas flood waters overflowing into freshwater wetlands, buffers, floodplains, and other areas that may be subject to storm flows and flooding are not only released more slowly downstream, thus reducing the damage they may cause, but flood waters may be absorbed into the ground water supply further reducing the flood hazard and recharging the vital ground water resource; and</p>
<p class="p8">Whereas precipitation patterns are known to be changing and Rhode Island has experienced a higher frequency of intense storm events resulting in flooding; and</p>
<p class="p8">Whereas freshwater wetlands and buffers are among the most valuable of all wildlife habitats and are high-value recreational areas as well, and wildlife and recreation are widely recognized as essential to the health, welfare, and general well-being of the general populace; and</p>
<p class="p8">Whereas it has been established through scientific study that activities conducted in lands adjacent to freshwater wetlands can exert influence on their condition, functions, and values and subsequently these lands should be protected; and</p>
<p class="p8">Whereas it has been established through scientific study that maintaining lands adjacent to freshwater wetlands as naturally vegetated buffers protects the functions and values of wetlands and that such buffers in and of themselves perform vital ecological functions; and</p>
<p class="p8">Whereas it has been established through scientific study that freshwater wetlands and buffers maintained in a natural condition can provide benefits to water quality through the filtering and uptake of water pollutants, retention of sediment, stabilizing shorelines, and other natural processes; and</p>
<p class="p8">Whereas freshwater wetlands, buffers, and floodplains, are increasingly threatened by random and frequently undesirable projects for drainage, excavation, filling, encroachment, or other forms of disturbance or destruction, and that a review of scientific literature indicates that aspects of existing state standards to protect these areas need to be strengthened; and</p>
<p class="p8">Whereas the protection of freshwater wetlands, buffers, floodplains, and other areas that may be subject to storm flows and flooding from random, unnecessary, and/or undesirable drainage, excavation, filling, encroachment, or any other form of disturbance or destruction is recognized as being in the best public interest and essential to the health, welfare, and general well-being of the general populace and essential to the protection of property and life during times of flood or other disaster affecting water levels or water supply;</p>
<p class="p8">Whereas the lack of uniform standards results in duplication of reviews administered by state and local governments and burdens businesses and property owners who require a predictable regulatory environment to be successful; and</p>
<p class="p8">Whereas it is recognized that statewide regulatory standards to protect freshwater wetlands, buffers, and floodplains are in the public interest, important to supporting economic vitality, and necessary to ensure protection is achieved in a consistent manner; and</p>
<p class="p8">Therefore, the provisions of the following sections are intended to preserve freshwater wetlands, buffers, and floodplains and regulate the use thereof through the establishment of jurisdictional areas and the regulation of activities consistent with this chapter.</p>

I, §§ 2 and 16 was without merit, since the defendants failed to introduce any evidence that the department of environmental management would have acted unfavorably had either defendant submitted an application for a permit to alter the subject property and they failed to sustain their burden of proof to demonstrate that the statute deprived them of all beneficial or economical use of their property.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> Application for approval of a project to the director of environmental management shall be made in a form to be prescribed by the director and provided by the director upon request. Prior to the application, a request may be made for preliminary determination as to whether this chapter applies. A preliminary determination shall be made by the director only after an on-site review of the project and the determination shall be made within thirty (30) days of the request. This chapter shall be determined to apply if a significant alteration appears to be contemplated and an application to alter a freshwater wetland, buffer, or floodplain will be required. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of the completed application accompanied by plans and drawings of the proposed project, the plans and drawings to be prepared by the registered professional engineer to a scale of not less than one inch (1") to one hundred feet (100'), the director shall notify all landowners whose properties are within two hundred feet (200') of the proposed project and the director will also notify the city or town council, the conservation commission, the planning board, the zoning board, and any other individuals and agencies in any city or town within the borders of which the project lies that may have reason, in the opinion of the director, to be concerned with the proposal. The director may also establish a mailing list of all interested persons and agencies who or that may wish to be notified of all applications.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> If the director receives any objection to the project within forty-five (45) days of the mailing of the notice of application from his or her office, the objection to be in writing and of a substantive nature, the director shall then schedule a public hearing in an appropriate place as convenient as reasonably possible to the site of the proposed project. The director shall inform by registered mail all objectors of the date, time, place, and subject of the hearing to be held. The director shall further publish notice of the time, place, date, and subject of the hearing in one local newspaper circulated in the area of the project and one statewide newspaper, the notices to appear once per week for at least two (2) consecutive weeks prior to the week during which the hearing is scheduled. The director shall establish a reasonable fee to cover the costs of the investigations, notifications and publications, and hearing and the applicant shall be liable for the fee.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(c)</b> If no public hearing is required, or following a public hearing, the director shall make his or her decision on the application and notify the applicant by registered mail and the applicant’s attorney and any other agent or representative of the applicant by mail of this decision within a period of six (6) weeks. If a public hearing was held, any persons who objected, in writing, during the forty-five (45) day period provided for objections shall be notified of the director’s decision by first-class mail.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(d)</b> In the event of a decision in favor of granting an application, the director shall issue a permit for the applicant to proceed with the project and shall require the applicant to pay a permit fee of one hundred dollars ($100). The permit may be issued upon any terms and conditions, including time for completion, that the director may require. Permits shall be valid for a period of one year from the date of issue and shall expire at the end of that time unless renewed. A permit may be renewed for up to three (3) additional one-year periods upon application by the original permit holder or a subsequent transferee of the property subject to permit, unless the original permit holder or transferee has failed to abide by the terms and conditions of the original permit or any prior renewal. The director may require new hearings if, in his or her judgment, the original intent of the permit is altered or extended by the renewal application or if the applicant has failed to abide by the terms of the original permit in any way. In addition, in the event a project authorized by a permit was not implemented by the permit holder or transferee because approval of the project by a federal agency, for which application had been timely made, had not been received or a federal agency had stopped the project from proceeding, prior to the expiration of the permit, the permit holder or transferee may apply for a renewal of the permit at any time prior to the tenth (10th) anniversary of the original issuance, and the application shall be deemed to be an insignificant alteration subject to expedited treatment. The request for renewal of a permit shall be made according to any procedures and form that the director may require.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(e)</b> The original permittee or subsequent transferee shall notify the director, in writing, of any change of ownership that occurs while an original or renewal permit is in effect by forwarding a certified copy of the deed of transfer of the property subject to the permit to the director.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(f)</b> A notice of permit and a notice of completion of work subject to permit shall be eligible for recordation under chapter 13 of title 34 and shall be recorded at the expense of the applicant in the land evidence records of the city or town where the property subject to permit is located and any subsequent transferee of the property shall be responsible for complying with the terms and conditions of the permit.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(g)</b> The director shall notify the person requesting a preliminary determination and the person’s attorney, agent, and other representative of his or her decision by letter, copies of which shall be sent by mail to the city or town clerk, the zoning board, the planning board, the building official, and the conservation commission in the city or town within which the project lies.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(h)</b> The director shall report to the general assembly on or before February 1 of each calendar year on his or her compliance with the time provisions contained in this chapter.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(i)</b> Normal farming activities shall be considered insignificant alterations and, as normal farming activities, shall be exempted from the provisions of this chapter in accordance with the following procedures:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Normal farming and ranching activities are those carried out by farmers as defined in this title, including plowing, seeding, cultivating, land clearing for routine agriculture purposes, harvesting of agricultural products, pumping of existing farm ponds for agricultural purposes, upland soil and water conservation practices, and maintenance of existing farm drainage structures, existing farm ponds and existing farm roads are permissible at the discretion of farmers in accordance with best farm management practices which assure that the adverse effects to the flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of freshwater wetlands are minimized and that any adverse effects on the aquatic environment are minimized.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> In the case of construction of new farm ponds, construction of new drainage structures, and construction of new farm roads, the division of agriculture shall be notified by the filing of a written application for the proposed construction by the property owner. The application shall include a description of the proposed construction and the date upon which construction is scheduled to begin, which date shall be no earlier than thirty (30) calendar days after the date of the filing of the application. The division of agriculture shall review such applications to determine that they are submitted for agricultural purposes and to ensure that adverse effects to the flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of freshwater wetlands are minimized and that any adverse effects on the aquatic environment are minimized and will not result in a significant alteration to the freshwater wetlands. Pursuant to this review, the division shall notify the applicant, in writing, whether the proposal is an insignificant alteration. This notice shall be issued not later than thirty (30) days after the date that the application was filed with the division. In the event notice is given by the division as required, the application shall be conclusively presumed to be an insignificant alteration. If no notice is given as required, or if an application is approved as an insignificant alteration, the applicant may cause construction to be done in accordance with the application, and neither the applicant, nor the applicant’s agents or employees who cause or perform the construction in accordance with the application, shall be liable for any criminal, civil, administrative or other fine, fee, or penalty, including restoration costs for violations alleged to arise from the construction.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The division of agriculture shall, in coordination with the agricultural council’s advisory committee, adopt regulations for subdivision (i)(2), and shall determine whether a proposed activity, other than an activity listed in subdivision (i)(1), constitutes a normal farming activity, or involves the best farm management practices. In making such a determination, the division of agriculture shall consider the proposed activity on a case-by-case basis, relative to the characteristics of the particular jurisdictional area in which the activity is proposed, and shall consider whether the activity incorporates best farm management practices and ensures that adverse effects to the flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of freshwater wetlands, buffers, and floodplains are minimized and that any adverse effects on the aquatic environment are minimized in each instance.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> Except as otherwise provided for farm road construction, filling of freshwater wetlands conforms to the provisions of this chapter.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(k)</b> For the purposes of this section as applicable to normal farming and ranching activities specified in §§ 2-1-22(i)(1) and (i)(2) above, freshwater wetlands shall be defined as: freshwater wetlands, floodplains, areas subject to storm flowage, areas subject to flooding as defined in § 2-1-20 and the land area within two hundred feet (200´) of a flowing body of water having a width of ten feet (10´) or more during normal flow; the area of land within one hundred feet (100´) of a flowing body of water having a width of less than ten feet (10´) during normal flow; and the area of land within fifty feet (50´) of a bog, marsh of one acre or greater, swamp of three (3) acres or greater and pond not less than one quarter (1/4) acre in extent.

<p class="p8"><b>Article I</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><b>Findings</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">The party states find that:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> In the absence of the higher degree of cooperation among them possible under this compact, the annual loss of approximately one hundred thirty-seven billion dollars ($137,000,000,000) from the depredations of pests is virtually certain to continue, if not to increase.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> Because of varying climatic, geographic and economic factors, each state may be affected differently by particular species of pests; but all states share the inability to protect themselves fully against those pests which present serious dangers to them.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> The migratory character of pest infestations makes it necessary for states both adjacent to and distant from one another to complement each other’s activities when faced with conditions of infestation and reinfestation.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(d)</b> While every state is seriously affected by a substantial number of pests, and every state is susceptible of infestation by many species of pests not now causing damage to its crop and plant life and products, the fact that relatively few species of pests present equal danger to or are of interest to all states makes the establishment and operation of an insurance fund, from which individual states may obtain financial support for pest control programs of benefit to them in other states and to which they may contribute in accordance with their relative interests, the most equitable means of financing cooperative pest eradication and control programs.</p>

<p class="p8">The Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis, a native insect pest of China, is known to be a serious insect pest to several tree species within the United States, including, but not limited to, maples, willows, poplars, birch, London Plane, and elms. The emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, also a native insect pest from Asia, is also known to be a serious insect pest to several types of ash trees within the United States, including, but not limited to, green ash, white ash, and black ash. All of the at-risk trees are part of the natural environment of Rhode Island and occur on many of the state’s public and private lands, contributing to their value and health. Additionally these insects pose substantive risk to the Rhode Island nursery and landscape industry plant materials and market opportunities. Accordingly, the Asian longhorned beetle and emerald ash borer are hereby declared to be public nuisances, and their suppression is authorized and required. No owner or occupant of an estate infested with either or both nuisances is by reason of that infestation liable to an action, civil or criminal, except to the extent and in the manner and form set forth in §§ 2-17-22 — 2-17-24.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> It is the duty of the director to inspect at least once each year during the growing season, all nurseries in the state of Rhode Island to ascertain whether they are infested with injurious insect pests or infected with injurious plant diseases. If upon the inspection of any nursery it appears that the nursery and the nursery stock are apparently free from injurious insects and plant diseases, it is the duty of the director to issue to the owner of the nursery, or the person in charge of the nursery, a certificate setting forth the fact of the inspection and freedom from injurious insects and plant diseases. Conversely, if inspection of any nursery and the stock reveals the presence of injurious insects and/or plant diseases, the owner or person in charge of the nursery shall take any measures to suppress or eradicate these injurious insects and/or plant diseases that the director prescribes, and a certificate shall not be issued until the director, by subsequent inspections, determines that the nursery and stock are apparently free from injurious insects and plant diseases.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> Notwithstanding subsection (a), the director may refuse to inspect and certify a nursery if the nursery, for lack of care or neglect, is in such condition that it cannot be adequately inspected.</p>

<p class="p4"><b>2-24-1.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ratification of compact — Text.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8">The governor having entered on behalf of this state into a compact, substantially in the following form, with one or more of the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Virginia and with any other states of the United States or provinces of the Dominion of Canada as may have legally joined in this compact, the legislature signifies its approval and ratification of the compact entered into, as to any of those states or provinces that may have or may hereafter legally join in the compact:</p>
<p class="p8"><b>ARTICLE I</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><b>STATEMENT OF PURPOSE, FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">Section 1. <i>Statement of purpose, findings and declaration of policy. </i>The purpose of this compact is to recognize by constitutional prerequisite the interstate character of the northeast dairy industry and to form an interstate commission for the northeast region. The mission of the commission is to take such steps as are necessary to assure the continued viability of dairy farming in the northeast, and to assure consumers of an adequate, local supply of pure and wholesome milk.</p>
<p class="p8">In today’s regional dairy marketplace, cooperative, rather than individual state action may address more effectively the market disarray. Under our constitutional system, properly authorized, states acting cooperatively may exercise more power to regulate, interstate commerce than they may assert individually without such authority. For this reason, the participating states invoke their authority to act in common agreement, with the consent of Congress, under the compact clause of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="p8">In establishing their constitutional regulatory authority over the region’s fluid milk market by this compact, the participating states declare their purpose that this compact neither displace the federal order system nor encourage the merging of federal orders. Specific provisions of the compact itself set forth this basic principle.</p>
<p class="p8">Designed as a flexible mechanism able to adjust to changes in a regulated marketplace, the compact also contains a contingency provision should the federal order system be discontinued. In that event, the interstate commission is authorized to regulate the marketplace in replacement of the order system. This contingent authority does not anticipate such a change, however, and should not be so construed. It is only provided should developments in the market other than establishment of this compact result in discontinuance of the order system.</p>
<p class="p8">Recent, dramatic price fluctuations, with a pronounced downward trend, threaten the viability and stability of the northeast dairy region. Historically, individual state regulatory action has been an effective emergency remedy available to farmers confronting a distressed market. The federal order system, implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 [7 U.S.C. § 601 et seq.], establishes only minimum prices for dairy products, without preempting the power of states to regulate milk prices above the minimum levels so established. Based on this authority, each state in the region has individually attempted to implement at least one regulatory program in response to the current dairy industry crisis.</p>
<p class="p8">The participating states find and declare that the dairy industry is the paramount agricultural activity of the northeast. Dairy farms, and associated suppliers, marketers, processors and retailers, are an integral component of the region’s economy. Their ability to provide a stable, local supply of pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the region.</p>
<p class="p8">The participating states further find that dairy farms are essential to the region’s rural communities and character. The farms preserve open spaces, sculpt the landscape and provide the land base for a diversity of recreational pursuits. In defining the rural character of our communities and landscape, dairy farms also provide a major draw for our tourist industries.</p>
<p class="p8">By entering into this compact, the participating states affirm that their ability to regulate the price which northeast dairy farmers receive for their product is essential to the public interest. Assurance of a fair and equitable price for dairy farmers ensures their ability to provide milk to the market and the vitality of the northeast dairy industry, with all the associated benefits.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> Investigate costs and charges for producing, hauling, handling, processing, distributing, selling and for all other services performed with respect to milk.</p>

<p class="p8">Section 9. <i>Equitable farm prices. </i>(a) The power granted in this section and § 10 shall apply only to the establishment of a compact over-order price, so long as federal milk marketing orders remain in effect in the region. In the event that any or all such orders are terminated, this article shall authorize the commission to establish one (1) or more commission marketing orders, as herein provided, in the region or parts thereof as defined in the order.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> A compact over-order price established pursuant to this section shall apply only to class I milk. Such over-order price shall not exceed one dollar fifty cents ($1.50) per gallon. Beginning in 1990, and using that year as a base, the foregoing one dollar fifty cents ($1.50) per gallon maximum shall be adjusted annually by the rate of change in the consumer price index as reported by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of labor. For purposes of the pooling and equalization of an over-order price, the value of milk used in other use classifications shall be calculated at the appropriate class price established pursuant to the applicable federal order or state dairy regulation and the value of unregulated milk shall be calculated in relation to the nearest prevailing class price in accordance with and subject to such adjustments as the commission may prescribe in regulations.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(e)</b> In determining the price, the commission shall consider the balance between production and consumption of milk and milk products in the regulated area, the costs of production including, but not limited to the price of feed, the cost of labor including the reasonable value of the producer’s own labor and management, machinery expense, and interest expense, the prevailing price for milk outside the regulated area, the purchasing power of the public and the price necessary to yield a reasonable return to the producer and distributor.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(f)</b> When establishing a compact over-order price, the commission shall take such action as necessary and feasible to ensure that the over-order price does not create an incentive for producers to generate additional supplies of milk.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(g)</b> The commission shall whenever possible enter into agreements with state or federal agencies for exchange of information or services for the purpose of reducing regulatory burden and cost of administering the compact. The commission may reimburse other agencies for the reasonable cost of providing these services.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> Provisions for the payment to all producers and associations of producers delivering milk to all handlers of uniform prices for all milk so delivered, irrespective of the uses made of such milk by the individual handler to whom it is delivered, or for the payment of producers delivering milk to the same handler of uniform prices for all milk delivered by them.</p>

No such provisions shall discriminate against milk producers outside the regulated area. The provisions for compensatory payments may require payment of the difference between the Class I price paid to producers for such milk in the state of production by a federal milk marketing order or state dairy regulation and the Class I price established by the compact over-order price or commission marketing order.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> Provisions specially governing the pricing and pooling of milk handled by partially regulated plants.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> The general assembly recognizes that forest land in the state has many important values, including, but not limited to: clean air, clean water, economic importance, climate change mitigation, habitat, and supporting human health and well-being. Forest land should be maintained to meet Rhode Island’s aggressive climate change goals through carbon sequestration and storage. Core forest land and connecting natural areas should be conserved to prevent ongoing fragmentation of the state’s forests. Moreover, forest conservation is necessary to protect and maintain water quality and important wildlife habitat. It is in the best interest of the people that the state identify and acquire the development rights to core and unfragmented forests so as to maintain these important forest values for future generations. Moreover, the state must develop incentives to encourage private forest land owners to maintain forests and to enhance urban and community forestry ecosystems that provide collective benefits to people and wildlife, including filtering air and water, controlling storm water, conserving energy, and a myriad of additional critical benefits.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> The general assembly finds that forest land is being converted to other uses because its current development value far exceeds its economic value to individual private landowners as forest; that forest land is an important part of the state’s economy, environment, and quality of life; and that forests provide important economic opportunities for many people living in the rural portions of the state. Whereas most of the development value of forests accrue to the private landowner, many of the economic benefits of retaining forests are also public benefits, some of which are not often quantified. All of this serves to undervalue forests without proper mechanisms and tools to account for public services and cost savings provided by private forests.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(c)</b> Therefore, the general assembly establishes a forest conservation commission to be coordinated and staffed by the department of environmental management to implement the following objectives:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

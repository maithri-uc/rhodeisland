<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was no town limitation on licenses, by the denial of petitioner’s application for the issuance of a Class A retail liquor license, the board was not thereby attempting to prescribe the maximum number of Class A licenses that could be issued but was denying the application on the basis that petitioner had not shown that the necessity and convenience of the residents of the town warranted the establishment of another retail liquor outlet under a Class A license which was within board’s discretion. Hobday v. O'Dowd, 94 R.I. 172, 179 A.2d 319, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 47 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The facts that, since there were already six Class B licenses within a radius of 2,000 feet, the local board considered an additional license in that area unnecessary and that the applicant for license indicated he proposed to sell his property, raised no question of law and the decision of the administrator who chose to overlook the decision of the local board and grant the license was final.

<p class="p7"><b>Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a proceeding for a suspension of license it was proper for the notice to charge a violation of § 3-8-1 in selling intoxicating beverages to minors rather than charge a violation of § 3-8-5. Hallene v. Smith, 98 R.I. 360, 201 A.2d 921, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 177 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice to petitioner that he had permitted the licensed premises to become disorderly in violation of the statute adequately informed him as to the offense with which he was charged under the statute in a hearing for revocation of a liquor license. Cesaroni v. Smith, 98 R.I. 377, 202 A.2d 292, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 181 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Proof of Violation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Liquor control administrator’s revocation of Class A liquor license for violation of § 3-7-10 in sale of alcoholic beverages to unlicensed dealers was reversed for failure to find that licensee had reason to believe beverages would be resold, but without prejudice to power of administrator to institute new proceedings on same conduct. Belconis v. Brewster, 65 R.I. 279, 14 A.2d 701, 1940 R.I. LEXIS 124 (1940).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where inspectors were lawfully on premises under §§ 3-2-2, 3-12-3 and obtained evidence after licensees consented to search, there was no violation of constitutional rights in obtaining evidence of violation. Kmiec v. Liquor Control Hearing Bd., 87 R.I. 257, 140 A.2d 133, 1958 R.I. LEXIS 49 (1958).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was not incumbent on the administrator to find the licensee guilty of permitting gambling on his premises beyond a reasonable doubt, but he would be justified in finding that he had permitted gambling within the licensed premises if there were any legal evidence from which he could find, or reasonably infer, that the licensee had failed in his obligation to maintain an efficient and affirmative supervision of the business to which his license applied. Scialo v. Smith, 99 R.I. 738, 210 A.2d 595, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 510 (1965).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Responsibility of Licensee.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though the responsibility may be onerous, a licensee agrees to assume such an obligation by its acceptance of the license. Schillers, Inc. v. Pastore, 419 A.2d 859, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1947 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Review.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was no valid reason for quashing the liquor control administrator’s decision of suspension in view of the evidence disclosed in the record that a minor was served liquor on the licensed premises, such act constituting such a violation of the statutory provisions justifying administrator’s order of suspension. Cesaroni v. O'Dowd, 94 R.I. 66, 177 A.2d 777, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 29 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was not an abuse of discretion for the administrator to consider matters in aggravation, such as the large number of minors in the licensed premises and the state of the record book showing proof of age, when he revoked petitioner’s license. Santos v. Smith, 99 R.I. 430, 208 A.2d 524, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 457 (1965).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Violation by Transferor.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where licensees are deceased at time of hearing and daughter-in-law was their transferee, she took license subject to charge of violating this section and suspension resulting is effective as to her license.

<p class="p7"><b>Discretion of Board.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In establishing “cause” as the controlling standard for administrative actions, the legislature did not intend to confer upon the licensing authority a limitless control or to permit the exercise of an unbridled discretion in revoking or suspending a license.

<p class="p7"><b>Grounds for Rejection.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the record reveals that the state liquor control administrator found that fistfights with attendant injuries occurred on the premises of licensed establishment, that patrons congregated on the sidewalks in front of the premises, that there were numerous bottle-throwing incidents on the premises, and that the owners had been warned by the police that failure to control such conduct could lead to disciplinary action, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the administrator’s finding of a violation of § 3-5-23 and the subsequent denial of petitioner’s application for the renewal of the liquor license. Mathieu v. Board of License Comm'rs, 115 R.I. 303, 343 A.2d 1, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1152 (1975).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A direct causational link sufficient to support a finding that disorderly incidents or disturbances occurring outside of a licensee’s premises had generated from within the premises so as to establish sufficient cause for nonrenewal of a liquor license is established when it can be reasonably inferred from the evidence presented that the disorderly incidents occurred just outside a licensee’s premises and had their genesis within.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not permit a town to deny a license renewal on the ground that a restaurant owner does not have an occupancy permit, where such a permit is not immediately available because the town obstructs the owner’s efforts to demolish and reconstruct his restaurant pursuant to a condemnation order issued by the state. De Falco v. Voccola, 557 A.2d 474, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 66 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Nature of Proceeding.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A proceeding under the laws regulating the sale of alcoholic beverages is entirely separate and distinct from a criminal prosecution for the same offense and the two proceedings are coexistent, one in nature of an action in rem, the other being against the licensee personally, and may be instituted and pursued simultaneously or otherwise. Chernov Enters. v. Sarkas, 109 R.I. 283, 284 A.2d 61, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1055 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Receivers.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A receiver applying for renewal of a license succeeds only to the debtor’s rights and a decree of the superior court enjoining the holding of a hearing on such application and ordering the town council to show cause why such license should not be renewed prior to a decision by such council after the scheduled hearing was premature.

The arbitration proceeding shall be held within the state and shall be governed by chapter 3 of title 10.

Every owner or keeper of thoroughbred dogs may make application to the city or town clerk or board of police commissioners or chief of police granting the dog licenses in the town or city in which that kennel is proposed to be located for what shall be known as a kennel license. The application states the name or names of the owner and keeper of the kennel, the proposed location of the kennel, and the number of dogs to be kept; and that the dogs are to be kept only for breeding and stud purposes. If that town or city clerk or board of police commissioners or chief of police deems that the kennel and the use and operation of that kennel at that location would not constitute a public nuisance, he, she, or they shall issue a kennel license authorizing the owner or keeper to keep the kennel in the definite location to be specified in the license, upon the payment by the applicant of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for the license. Every kennel license is for a period not exceeding one year and expires on the first day of April. All moneys received shall be credited to the dog fund of the town or city. Any person without a kennel license who establishes or keeps a kennel shall be fined not exceeding five dollars ($5.00) for each day the kennel is kept.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence of prior peaceable habits of the dog was not admissible either as a defense or in mitigation of damages. Kelly v. Alderson, 19 R.I. 544, 37 A. 12, 1896 R.I. LEXIS 90 (1896).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action for injuries resulting from a dog bite, the peaceable character of the dog was not material, because the statute has enlarged the common law liability of the dog’s owner or keeper. Whittet v. Bertsch, 39 R.I. 31, 97 A. 18, 1916 R.I. LEXIS 18 (1916).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rhode Island Supreme Court has never stated that the only type of prior incident which would suffice to indicate a dog’s vicious propensity is restricted to a bite; the pertinent language of this section imposes liability when a dog assaults, bites, or otherwise injures any person. Other kinds of canine behavior that might cause injury to persons may clearly indicate a dog’s vicious propensities; therefore, a determination of whether a incident relating to a scratch by an offending dog rose to the level of a vicious propensity was one that should properly have been made by a finder of fact after a trial.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there were no signs, fences, gates or other barriers and nothing to warn the general public that there was a dog running loose on the land, there was no enclosure under this section and it was not error to award damages for a dog bite.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a dog bite case wherein a guest was bitten in a second floor apartment leased from the building owner, who lived in the first-floor apartment, a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the second-floor apartment was an entirely separate “enclosure” from the first-floor apartment where the dog had been because there was no inquiry into whether the second-floor apartment was kept locked and whether the owner was excluded from the premises. Carreiro v. Tobin, 66 A.3d 820, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 88 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a dog bite case, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a delivery man was within an enclosure at the time he was bitten; the existence of an enclosure for purposes of this section was usually a fact-intensive inquiry.

<p class="p7"><b>Federal Immunity.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The federal government may not be held liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) as a “harborer or keeper” of a dog which bites a child living in a military housing area, because Rhode Island dog bite law provides for strict liability, i.e., liability absent proof of scienter, negligence, or fault, and the FTCA precludes strict liability actions against the United States government.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One purpose of enacting this section was to relieve the plaintiff from the burden of proving knowledge of the previous acts and character of the dog but this was not the only purpose and the words “or otherwise injure any person” were broad enough to sustain an action for indirect injuries.

The director of environmental management is authorized to issue an order to restrain all dogs from running at large in any city or town where, in the director’s opinion, this restraining order is necessary to prevent dogs from chasing, hunting, molesting, attacking, or killing deer. This order shall be in effect forty-eight (48) hours after publication in one or more newspapers circulated in the city or town. When, in the director’s opinion, the director determines that this restraining order is no longer necessary, the director shall, by publication, rescind this order. A person owning, keeping, or possessing a dog shall restrain it from running at large in any city or town in which this restraining order is in effect. The chief of the division of enforcement, the chief’s assistants, conservation officers, members of the state police, members of the local police, in areas over which they have jurisdiction, may issue a citation to the owner of any dog found chasing, hunting, molesting, attacking, or killing a deer, charging the owner with a violation of this chapter. During any period when this order is not in force, the chief of the division of enforcement, the chief’s assistants, conservation officers and members of the state police and members of the local police and park police in areas over which they have jurisdiction, may issue a citation to the owner of any dog found chasing or hunting a deer if the dog is chasing or hunting with the knowledge or consent of the owner. Whenever a dog has been found chasing, hunting, molesting, attacking, or killing a deer and the owner or keeper of the dog has been notified by the director, and the same dog is found chasing, hunting, molesting, attacking, or killing, it shall be prima facie evidence that this chasing, hunting, molesting, attacking, or killing was with the knowledge or consent of the owner or keeper.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> In the event that the dog officer or law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a dog is vicious, the chief dog officer, or his or her immediate supervisor, or the chief of police, or his or her designee, is empowered to convene a hearing for the purpose of determining whether or not the dog in question should be declared vicious. The dog officer or chief of police shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, an investigation and shall notify the owner or keeper of the dog that a hearing will be held, at which time he or she may have the opportunity to present evidence why the dog should not be declared vicious. The hearing shall be held promptly within no less than five (5), nor more than ten (10), days after service of notice upon the owner or keeper of the dog. The hearing shall be informal and shall be open to the public. The hearing shall be conducted by a panel of three (3) persons that shall consist of the chief of police, or his or her designee, the executive director of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (S.P.C.A.), or his or her designee; and a person chosen by the chief of police and the executive director of the S.P.C.A. All members of the panel shall have one vote in making a determination whether or not the dog in question is vicious. Hearing officers shall have immunity.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> After the hearing, the owner or keeper of the dog shall be notified in writing of the determination. If a determination is made that the dog is vicious, the owner or keeper shall comply with this chapter in accordance with a time schedule established by the dog officer or chief of police, but in no case more than thirty (30) days subsequent to the date of the determination. If the owner or keeper of the dog contests the determination, he or she may, within five (5) days of that determination, bring a petition in the district court within the judicial district where the dog is owned or kept, praying that the court conduct its own hearing on whether or not the dog should be declared vicious. After service of notice upon the dog officer, the court shall conduct a hearing de novo and make its own determination as to viciousness. The hearing shall be conducted within seven (7) days of the service of the notice upon the dog officer or law enforcement officer involved. The issue shall be decided upon the preponderance of the evidence. If the court rules the dog to be vicious, the court may establish a time schedule to ensure compliance with this chapter, but in no case more than thirty (30) days subsequent to the date of the court’s determination. If the owner has not complied with the provisions of this chapter at the end of thirty (30) days from the written notification that the dog is vicious, the dog may be euthanized.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The court may decide all issues for or against the owner or keeper of the dog regardless of the fact that the owner or keeper fails to appear at the hearing.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The determination of the district court shall be final and conclusive upon all parties. The dog officer or any law enforcement officer shall have the right to convene a hearing under this section for any subsequent actions of the dog.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> In the event that the dog officer or law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that the dog in question is vicious and may pose a threat of serious harm to human beings or other domestic animals, the dog officer or law enforcement officer may seize and impound the dog pending the hearings.</p>
<p class="p6">The owner or keeper of the dog is liable to the city or town where the dog is impounded for the costs and expenses of keeping the dog. The city or town council may establish by ordinance a schedule of those costs and expenses.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For purposes of determining liability under R.I. Gen. Laws § 4-14-1, the distinguishing factor in determining whether an animal is “at large” is the presence or absence of control. If an animal is roaming at will and free to follow its own instincts, it may be said to be “at large;” however, if it is either physically restrained or subject to the moral authority of the person in charge, it is not “at large.” Johnston v.

It is declared to be the policy of the state to require that the slaughter of all livestock and the handling of livestock, in connection with slaughter, be carried out only by humane methods and to provide that methods of slaughter conform generally to those employed in other states where humane slaughter is required by law and to those authorized by the Federal Humane Slaughter Act of 1958, 7 U.S.C. § 1901 et seq., and regulations under that act.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The state finds that a cat identification program, which would require an owner of a cat to maintain an identification for the cat, would serve the following public purposes:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Cat identification would provide cats protection under the law, equal to that afforded dogs, by establishing ownership which, in turn, would encourage cat owners to take full responsibility for their pets’ welfare.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Cat identification would protect cats, as dogs are now protected, by establishing minimum holding periods for cats released to and/or impounded by municipal animal control facilities and private animal shelters.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> A program to require cat identification should facilitate the return of lost, owned cats.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> Cat identification would provide a method to help distinguish between owned and unowned cat populations thus assisting animal control officers and animal shelters in carrying out their mission.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> Cat identification would advance the reduction of the untold suffering of cats at-large in our state by helping to insure the quick return of injured and sick animals to their owners.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> Passage of this bill would reduce the number of unowned cats and increase education to owners as to the need for sterilization of cats, thereby reducing unwanted litters, eliminating cat over-population problems, and reducing the costs to cities and towns for euthanizing at-large or unowned cats.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> Cat identification would help support public health and safety in the control of rabies.</p>
<p class="p6">The purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to establish a cat identification program, which would require that an owner of a cat maintain an identification for the cat. These measures will also reduce the spread of rabies.</p>

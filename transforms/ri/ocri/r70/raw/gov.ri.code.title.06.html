While price comparisons accurately reflecting market values in the trade area provide consumers with useful information in making value comparisons and market buying decisions, price comparisons based on arbitrary or inflated prices or values can only serve to deceive or mislead.

The terms “producer”, “manufacturer”, “wholesaler”, “importer”, or words of similar meaning, mean sellers engaged in resales, not sellers of products or services for consumer, personal, family, or household use or consumption. No price comparison may be made by a seller for precious metal and stones at wholesale, wholesale prices, factory prices, or the like. If the prices for the sale being offered are the net-cost prices retailers usually and customarily pay when they buy that merchandise for resale, sales may be termed net-cost sales and in that event sellers may advertise cost prices providing the substantiation of net-cost prices that are maintained for six (6) months. In no event may retailers, in their departments that sell precious metals or stones, hold themselves or their sale out as wholesalers or as wholesale prices or otherwise;</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> “Precious metal” means metals that are prized because of chemical and physical properties (notably resistant to corrosion, hardness, strength, and beauty) desirable in jewelry, coinage, and objects of art, and that are at the same time relatively rare or inexpensive.

Burdon v. Unrath, 46 R.I. 89, 125 A. 204, 1924 R.I. LEXIS 52 (1924).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Discharge or Extension of Previous Debts.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where money borrowed was used to pay off a previous loan owed to a different party, the amount of discount that the borrower received in paying off the previous loan could not be credited to the lender as a deduction from the amount of interest the borrower paid on the second loan so as to reduce the interest from a usurious rate to a legal rate. St. Germain v. Lapp, 72 R.I. 42, 48 A.2d 181, 1946 R.I. LEXIS 40 (1946).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an existing loan was paid off and the mortgage securing such loan was discharged by means of a new loan obtained from a different party at an usurious rate of interest, the rule that an usurious bonus paid for the extension of a prior loan will not invalidate the transaction but will be applied in reducing the amount owed had no application. St. Germain v. Lapp, 72 R.I. 42, 48 A.2d 181, 1946 R.I. LEXIS 40 (1946).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Transaction in which an existing loan was paid off and mortgage securing such loan was discharged by means of a new loan obtained from a different party with an usurious interest rate was not a business transaction whereby an extension of time was purchased for benefit of the purchaser but constituted a loan of money at an usurious rate. St. Germain v. Lapp, 72 R.I. 42, 48 A.2d 181, 1946 R.I. LEXIS 40 (1946).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where evidence of entire proceedings surrounding obtaining of loan was necessary for an understanding of the situation, such evidence was relevant and properly admissible in action for repayment of usurious loan. Burdon v. Unrath, 46 R.I. 89, 125 A. 204, 1924 R.I. LEXIS 52 (1924).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Promissory note for $100,000 securing a mortgage on a debt of about $68,000 from a son to his father did not establish a usurious 32% interest rate prohibited by R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 6-26-2(a), 6-26-4(a); the trial court properly found that the note’s facial 12% rate applied to funds transferred by the father to the son before the note was signed, less amounts covered by a partial release, and that recovery of sums transferred after the note was signed would be without interest. Opella v. Opella, 896 A.2d 714, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 77 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Intent of Lender.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where mistake of lender was one of law rather than of fact, the fact that lender did not intend to violate the usury statute did not excuse the violation. Burdon v. Unrath, 47 R.I. 227, 132 A. 728, 1926 R.I. LEXIS 43 (1926).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Parties in Pari Delicto.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fact that plaintiff seeking to recover payment made to defendant under usurious note had taken a usurious note from a third party did not render plaintiff and defendant in pari delicto so as to defeat plaintiff’s right of recovery where plaintiff’s contract with the third party had no relation to the contract between plaintiff and defendant. Burdon v. Unrath, 46 R.I. 89, 125 A. 204, 1924 R.I. LEXIS 52 (1924).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Pleadings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A complaint for damages for a usurious contract is insufficient if it does not allege that plaintiff has paid something on the usurious obligation. Rowell v. Kaplan, 103 R.I. 60, 235 A.2d 91, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 576 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Usurious Interest as Consideration.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mere release of a part of usurious interest does not of itself constitute a valid consideration for an alleged general release. Nazarian v. Lincoln Fin. Corp., 77 R.I. 497, 78 A.2d 7, 1951 R.I. LEXIS 115 (1951).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Usurious Loan Void.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although in law a mortgage is of no effect as security for a usurious contract, equity will treat the mortgage as valid security for the amount it regards as justly due from the borrower to the lender. Moncrief v. Palmer, 44 R.I. 37, 114 A. 181, 1921 R.I. LEXIS 41 (1921).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court properly found that a loan was usurious and void because a fee contained in the loan agreement was not a commercial loan commitment fee since it did not assure the availability of a specified amount of credit for a specified time; the fee was a part of the interest being charged on the loan, and it substantially exceeded the 21 percent interest allowed. Labonte (Am. Steel Coatings, LLC) v. New Eng. Dev. R.I., LLC, 93 A.3d 537, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 96 (R.I. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Waiver.</b></p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The general assembly finds that economic stabilization would be enhanced and that competition among the various financial institutions and other firms engaged in the extension of consumer credit would be strengthened by the informed use of credit. The informed use of credit results from an awareness of the cost of credit by consumers. It is the purpose of this chapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him or her and thus avoid the uninformed use of credit.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> No creditor shall impose a finance charge in excess of an amount equal to eighteen percent (18%) simple interest per annum. This subsection shall not apply to any transaction in connection with which the finance charge does not exceed ten dollars ($10.00). Notwithstanding the provision of any retail installment contract to the contrary, a buyer may prepay in full the unpaid balance of any retail installment contract at any time before its final due date and, if the buyer does so, shall receive a refund credit on the retail installment contract for the prepayment. The amount of the refund credit of finance charges on precomputed loans, made for an original term of sixty (60) months or less, may be calculated on the method commonly referred to as the rule of 78s or sum of the digits. Refund credits of finance charges on precomputed loans, made for an original term greater than sixty (60) months, must be at least the amount as that produced by the rule of anticipation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Where the amount of refund credit is less than one dollar ($1.00), no refund credit need be made.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, the maximum finance charge that may be applied under a revolving or open-end credit plan in connection with a transaction arising out of a retail sale of consumer goods, including the retail sale of gasoline or services, shall not exceed the rate or rates agreed to by the creditor and a retail buyer compared on the average daily balance of the open-end or revolving account or the unpaid balance of the open-end or revolving account outstanding as of the end of the current billing cycle. Regardless of any agreement to the contrary, a transaction under a revolving or open-end credit plan is subject to this section whenever a solicitation for the extension of credit is made by a creditor whose primary activity in Rhode Island is soliciting Rhode Island customers through the mails and the solicitation originates outside Rhode Island but is directed to, and received by, a retail buyer who resides and responds to the solicitation in Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> This section shall not apply to any person doing business under and as permitted by any general or special law of this state or of the United States relating to: (1) financial institutions, (2) credit unions, or (3) licensees pursuant to title 19, chapter 44 of title 6, and § 6-26-2.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Under each revolving or open-end credit plan a late fee not to exceed twelve dollars ($12.00) may be assessed on each minimum payment not paid in full within forty (40) days following the billing date of the statement on which the minimum payment first appears.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Rhode Island is striving to build an entrepreneurial- and knowledge-based economy. Attracting and nurturing internet technology (“IT”) and other knowledge-based companies is an important part of this effort and will be beneficial to Rhode Island’s future.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Patents are essential to encouraging innovation, especially in the IT- and knowledge-based fields. The protections afforded by the federal patent system create an incentive to invest in research and innovation, which spurs economic growth. Patent holders have every right to enforce their patents when they are infringed, and patent enforcement litigation is necessary to protect intellectual property.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The general assembly does not wish to interfere with the good-faith enforcement of patents or good-faith patent litigation. The general assembly also recognizes that Rhode Island is preempted from passing any law that conflicts with federal patent law.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Patent litigation can be technical, complex, and expensive. The expense of patent litigation, which may cost hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, can be a significant burden on small- and medium-size companies. Rhode Island wishes to help its businesses avoid these costs by encouraging the most efficient resolution of patent-infringement claims without conflicting with federal law.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> In order for Rhode Island companies to be able to respond promptly and efficiently to patent infringement assertions against them, it is necessary that they receive specific information regarding how their product, service, or technology may have infringed the patent at issue. Receiving such information at an early stage will facilitate the resolution of claims and lessen the burden of potential litigation on Rhode Island companies.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Abusive patent litigation, and especially the assertion of bad-faith infringement claims, can harm Rhode Island companies. A business that receives a letter asserting such claims faces the threat of expensive and protracted litigation and may feel that it has no choice but to settle and to pay a licensing fee, even if the claim is meritless. This is especially so for companies and nonprofits that lack the resources to investigate and defend themselves against infringement claims.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> Not only do bad-faith patent infringement claims impose a significant burden on individual Rhode Island businesses, these claims also undermine Rhode Island’s efforts to attract and nurture other knowledge-based companies. Funds used to avoid the threat of bad-faith litigation are no longer available to invest, produce new products, expand, or hire new workers, thereby harming Rhode Island’s economy.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> Through this narrowly focused act, the general assembly seeks to facilitate the efficient and prompt resolution of patent-infringement claims; protect Rhode Island businesses from abusive and bad-faith assertions of patent infringement; and build Rhode Island’s economy, while at the same time respecting federal law and being careful to not interfere with legitimate patent-enforcement actions.</p>

<p class="p6">The general assembly finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Identity theft is a growing menace for consumers in the new economy, as vast quantities of sensitive, personal information has become vulnerable to criminal interception and misuse;</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> An integral part of many identity thefts involves the interception of personal financial data, the fraudulent acquisition of credit cards or other financial products in another person’s name;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(d)</b> Identity theft is an act that violates the privacy of our citizens, ruins their good names and may subject them to restricted access to credit, diminished employment opportunities, and months or years of effort to repair damage to credit histories;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(e)</b> Social security numbers are frequently used as identification numbers in many computer files, giving access to information an individual may want kept private, making it [is] wise to limit access to an individual’s social security number whenever possible; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(f)</b> It is therefore a valid public purpose for the Rhode Island general assembly to ensure that the private financial information and social security numbers of the citizens of the state of Rhode Island are less accessible, in order to mitigate the potential for more identity theft to occur.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">Any time that a consumer is required to receive a summary of rights required under section 609 of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, (15 U.S.C. § 1681 et. seq.) the following notice shall be included:</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Consumers have the right to obtain a security freeze<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">You may obtain a security freeze on your credit report to protect your privacy and ensure that credit is not granted in your name without your knowledge. You have a right to place a “security freeze” on your credit report pursuant to chapter 48 of title 6 of the Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2006.</p>
<p class="p6">The security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing any information in your credit report without your express authorization or approval.</p>
<p class="p6">The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, within five (5) business days you will be provided a personal identification number or password to use if you choose to remove the freeze on your credit report or to temporarily authorize the release of your credit report for a specific period of time after the freeze is in place. To provide that authorization, you must contact the consumer reporting agency and provide all of the following:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The unique personal identification number or password provided by the consumer reporting agency.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Proper identification to verify your identity.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The proper information regarding the period of time for which the report shall be available to users of the credit report.</p>
<p class="p6">A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a freeze on a credit report shall comply with the request no later than three (3) business days after receiving the request.</p>
<p class="p6">A security freeze does not apply to circumstances where you have an existing account relationship and a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents or affiliates for certain types of an account review, collection, fraud control, or similar activities.</p>
<p class="p6">If you are actively seeking a new credit, loan, utility, telephone, or insurance account, you should understand that the procedures involved in lifting a security freeze may slow your own applications for credit. You should plan ahead and lift a freeze — either completely, if you are shopping around, or specifically for a certain creditor — with enough advance notice before you apply for new credit for the lifting to take effect.</p>
<p class="p6">You have a right to bring a civil action against someone who violates your rights under the credit reporting laws. The action can be brought against a consumer reporting agency or a user of your credit report.</p>
<p class="p6">Unless you are sixty-five (65) years of age or older, or you are a victim of identity theft with an incident report or complaint from a law enforcement agency, a consumer reporting agency has the right to charge you up to ten dollars ($10.00) to place a freeze on your credit report; up to ten dollars ($10.00) to temporarily lift a freeze on your credit report, depending on the circumstances; and up to ten dollars ($10.00) to remove a freeze from your credit report. If you are sixty-five (65) years of age or older or are a victim of identity theft with a valid incident report or complaint, you may not be charged a fee by a consumer reporting agency for placing, temporarily lifting, or removing a freeze.</p>

A lessor or secured party may initiate a procedure to cure by sending to the consumer, at any time after the consumer has been in default for ten (10) days, a notice of the right to cure the default. Said notice shall be delivered via certified mail, return receipt requested, or via first-class mail, at the consumer’s address last known to the lessor or secured party.

<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The notice shall be in writing and shall conspicuously state the rights of the consumer upon default in substantially the following form:</p>

If you pay this amount within the time allowed you are no longer in default and may continue with the automobile (lease or loan) agreement as though no default has occurred.</p>
<p class="p6">If you do not cure your default by the date stated above, the lessor or secured party may sue you to obtain a judgment for the amount of the debt and may take possession of the automobile.</p>
<p class="p6">If the lessor or secured party takes possession of the automobile, you may get it back by paying the full amount of your debt plus any reasonable expenses incurred by the lessor or secured party if you make the required payment within twenty (20) days after the lessor or secured party takes possession.</p>
<p class="p6">If (the secured party) sells the vehicle repossessed from the consumer for an amount exceeding the amount outstanding on the automobile (loan) agreement including reasonable expenses related to judicial action and or repossession, the excess funds shall be returned promptly to the defaulting consumer.</p>
<p class="p6">You have the right to cure a default only once in any twelve-month (12) period during the period of the automobile (lease or loan) agreement. If you default again within the next twelve (12) months in making your payments, we may exercise our rights without sending you another right to cure notice. If you have questions, telephone (name of lessor or secured party) at (phone number).”</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Within the period for cure stated in the notice under this section, the consumer may cure the default by tendering the amount of all unpaid sums due at the time of tender, including any unpaid delinquency or default charges, but without additional security deposit or prepayment of period payments not yet due.

The certificate of correction must specify the inaccuracy or defect to be corrected and set forth the portion of the instrument in corrected form. The corrected instrument must be specifically designated as such in its heading, specify the inaccuracy or defect to be corrected, and set forth the entire instrument in corrected form.

<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment of a meeting of shareholders, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors of a corporation may provide that stock transfer books are closed for a stated period, not less than that specified in any applicable bylaw and not more than sixty (60) days. In lieu of closing the stock transfer books, the bylaws, or in the absence of an applicable bylaw, the board of directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for any determination of shareholders, the date in any case to be not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring the determination of shareholders, is to be taken. If the stock transfer books are not closed and no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the board of directors declaring the dividend is adopted, as the case may be, is the record date for the determination of shareholders. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, the determination applies to any adjournment of the meeting.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date may not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by this chapter, is the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in this state, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to a corporation’s registered office must be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by this chapter, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting is the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.</p>

The trustee or trustees shall keep a record of the holders of voting trust certificates evidencing a beneficial interest in the voting trust, giving the names and addresses of all the holders and the number and class of the shares in respect of which the voting trust certificates held by each are issued, and shall deposit a copy of the record with the corporation at its registered office. The counterpart of the voting trust agreement and the copy of the record deposited with the corporation are subject to the same right of examination by a shareholder of the corporation, in person or by agent or attorney, as are the books and records of the corporation, and the counterpart and the copy of the record is subject to examination by any holder of record of voting trust certificates, either in person or by agent or attorney, at any reasonable time for any proper purpose.

<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> Agreements among shareholders regarding the voting of their shares are valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms for a period not to exceed ten (10) years.

<p class="p8"><b>(c)</b> The provisions of this section are construed as permissive and should not be interpreted to invalidate any voting or other agreement among shareholders, or any irrevocable proxy which is otherwise not illegal.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(d)</b> A voting trust or shareholders agreement may at any time or times be extended for an additional period not in excess of ten (10) years, but the extension is binding only with respect to those shares owned of record or beneficially by parties to the extension.</p>

The number of directors may be increased or decreased from time to time by amendment to, or in the manner provided in, the articles of incorporation or the bylaws, but no decrease has the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director.

Initial directors hold office until the first annual meeting of shareholders, and until their successors have been elected and qualified. At the first annual meeting of shareholders and at each subsequent annual meeting, the shareholders shall elect directors to hold office until the next succeeding annual meeting, except in the case of the classification of directors as permitted by this chapter. Each director holds office for the term for which he or she is elected and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified.

<p class="p8">When the board of directors consists of nine (9) or more members, in lieu of electing the whole number of directors annually, the articles of incorporation may provide that the directors be divided into either two (2) or three (3) classes, each class to be as nearly equal in number as possible, the term of office of directors of the first class to expire at the first annual meeting of shareholders after their election, that of the second class to expire at the second annual meeting after their election, and that of the third class, if any, to expire at the third annual meeting after their election. At each annual meeting after the classification, the number of directors equal to the number of the class whose term expires at the time of the meeting will be elected to hold office until the second succeeding annual meeting, if there are two (2) classes, or until the third succeeding annual meeting, if there are three (3) classes. No classification of directors is effective prior to the first annual meeting of shareholders. The articles of incorporation may confer upon holders of any class or series of shares the right to elect one or more directors who serve for any term and have any voting powers stated in the articles of incorporation. The terms of office and voting powers of the directors elected in the manner provided in the articles of incorporation may be greater than or less than those of any other director or class of directors.</p>

The resolution may incorporate the proposed amendment in restated articles of incorporation which contain a statement that, except for the designated amendment, the restated articles of incorporation correctly state without change the corresponding provisions of the articles of incorporation as previously amended, and that the restated articles of incorporation, together with the designated amendment, supersede the original articles of incorporation and all amendments to those articles.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> Any shareholder electing to exercise the right of dissent shall file with the corporation, prior to or at the meeting of shareholders at which the proposed corporate action is submitted to a vote, a written objection to the proposed corporate action. If the proposed corporate action is approved by the required vote and the shareholder has not voted in favor of it, the shareholder may, within ten (10) days after the date on which the vote was taken, or if a corporation is to be merged without a vote of its shareholders into another corporation, any of its shareholders may, within fifteen (15) days after the plan of the merger has been mailed to the shareholders, make written demand on the corporation, or, in the case of a merger, on the surviving or new corporation, domestic or foreign, for payment of the fair value of the shareholder’s shares. If the proposed corporate action is effected, the corporation shall pay to the shareholder, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares, the fair value of the shares as of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken approving the proposed corporate action, excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the corporate action. Any shareholder failing to make demand within the ten (10) day period or the fifteen (15) day period, as the case may be, is bound by the terms of the proposed corporate action. Any shareholder making the demand is thereafter only entitled to payment as provided in this section and is not entitled to vote or to exercise any other rights of a shareholder.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> No demand may be withdrawn unless the corporation consents to it. If, however, the demand is withdrawn upon consent, or if the proposed corporate action is abandoned or rescinded or the shareholders revoke the authority to effect the action, or if, in the case of a merger, on the date of the filing of the articles of merger the surviving corporation is the owner of all the outstanding shares of the other corporations, domestic and foreign, that are parties to the merger, or if no demand or petition for the determination of fair value by a court has been made or filed within the time provided in this section, or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the shareholder is not entitled to the relief provided by this section, then the right of the shareholder to be paid the fair value of his or her shares ceases and his status as a shareholder is restored, without prejudice to any corporate proceedings taken during the interim.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(c)</b> Within ten (10) days after the corporate action is effected, the corporation, or, in the case of a merger, the surviving or new corporation, domestic or foreign, shall give written notice of the action to each dissenting shareholder who has made demand as provided in these provisions, and shall make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to pay for the shares at a specified price deemed by the corporation to be the fair value of the shares. The notice and offer must be accompanied by a balance sheet of the corporation the shares of which the dissenting shareholder holds, as of the latest available date and not more than twelve (12) months prior to the making of the offer, and a profit and loss statement of the corporation for the twelve (12) month period ended on the date of the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(d)</b> If within thirty (30) days after the date on which the corporate action was effected the fair value of the shares is agreed upon between any dissenting shareholder and the corporation, payment for the shares must be made within ninety (90) days after the date on which the corporate action was effected, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares. Upon payment of the agreed value, the dissenting shareholder ceases to have any interest in the shares.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(e)</b> If within the period of thirty (30) days a dissenting shareholder and the corporation do not agree on the matter, then the corporation, within thirty (30) days after receipt of written request for the filing from any dissenting shareholder given within sixty (60) days after the date on which the corporate action was effected, shall, or at its election at any time within the period of sixty (60) days may, file a petition in any court of competent jurisdiction in the county in this state where the registered office of the corporation is located praying that the fair value of the shares is found and determined. If, in the case of a merger, the surviving or new corporation is a foreign corporation without a registered office in this state, the petition must be filed in the county where the registered office of the domestic corporation was last located. If the corporation fails to institute the proceeding as provided, any dissenting shareholder may do so in the name of the corporation. All dissenting shareholders, wherever they reside, must be made parties to the proceeding as an action against their shares quasi in rem. A copy of the petition must be served on each dissenting shareholder who is a resident of this state and served by registered or certified mail on each dissenting shareholder who is a nonresident. Service on nonresidents may also be made by publication as provided by law. The jurisdiction of the court is plenary and exclusive. All shareholders who are parties to the proceeding are entitled to judgment against the corporation for the amount of the fair value of their shares. The court may, if it so elects, appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers have the power and authority that is specified in the order of their appointment or an amendment of the order. The judgment is payable only upon and concurrently with the surrender to the corporation of the certificate or certificates representing the shares. Upon payment of the judgment, the dissenting shareholder ceases to have any interest in the shares.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(f)</b> The judgment should include an allowance for interest at the rate of interest on judgments in civil actions from the date on which the vote was taken on the proposed corporate action to the date of payment.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(g)</b> The court shall determine and assess the costs and expenses of any proceeding against the corporation, but all or any part of the costs and expenses may be apportioned and assessed as the court deems equitable against any or all of the dissenting shareholders who are parties to the proceeding to whom the corporation has made an offer to pay for the shares if the court finds that the action of the shareholders in failing to accept the offer was arbitrary or vexatious or not in good faith. The expenses include reasonable compensation for and reasonable expenses of the appraisers, but exclude the fees and expenses of counsel for and experts employed by any party; but if the fair value of the shares as determined materially exceeds the amount which the corporation offered to pay for the shares, or if no offer was made, the court in its discretion may award to any shareholder who is a party to the proceeding a sum that the court determines to be reasonable compensation to any expert or experts employed by the shareholder in the proceeding.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(h)</b> Within twenty (20) days after demanding payment for his or her shares, each shareholder demanding payment shall submit the certificate or certificates representing his or her shares to the corporation for notation on the certificate that the demand has been made. His or her failure to do so may, at the option of the corporation, terminate his or her rights under this section unless a court of competent jurisdiction, for good and sufficient cause shown, directs otherwise. If shares represented by a certificate on which notation has been made are transferred, each new certificate issued for the shares must bear similar notation, together with the name of the original dissenting holder of the shares, and a transferee of the shares acquires by the transfer no rights in the corporation other than those which the original dissenting shareholder had after making demand for payment of the fair value of the shares.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(i)</b> Shares acquired by a corporation pursuant to payment of the agreed value for the shares or to payment of the judgment entered for the shares, as provided in this section, may be held and disposed of by the corporation. However, in the case of a merger, they may be held and disposed of as the plan of merger otherwise provides.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>Interest.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court erred in basing an interest award upon an equitable rate of interest per subsection (f); former § 7-1.1-90.1 (see now § 7-1.2-1315) limited the use of the procedures in former § 7-1.1-74 (see now this section) solely to determining the purchase price, or fair value, of the shares involved, and not to ascertaining what interest shall be awarded. DiLuglio v. Providence Auto Body, Inc., 755 A.2d 757, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 159 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Measure of Damages.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions linking the measure of damages for conversion with the phrase “full and fair value” were not intended to define restrictively the meaning of that phrase but rather were intended to fix the time as of which such value was to be determined by an exercise of the appraisal procedure. Jeffrey v. American Screw Co., 98 R.I. 286, 201 A.2d 146, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 163 (1964).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the shareholder seeks nothing more than the value of his shares, then appraisal is the exclusive remedy. On the other hand, when there are allegations of fraud, unfair dealing or breaches of fiduciary obligations, the plaintiff should not be deprived of other remedies such as rescission and injunctive relief that might be necessary to restore him to the position he otherwise would have occupied. Dowling v. Narragansett Capital Corp., 735 F. Supp. 1105, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4830 (D.R.I. 1990).</p>

<p class="p6"><b>— Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An appraiser had as wide a latitude to consider evidence otherwise competent on the issue of determination of value of stock as is enjoyed by a court in an action at law for conversion, subject to limitation that no consideration will be given to an appreciation or depreciation in the value of stock at a time subsequent to the date of the vote to transfer the assets.

<p class="p6"><b>Petition.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A dissenting stockholder was required to file a petition for the appraisal of his stock within three months after the vote of approval by the corporation in which he was a stockholder. Spear v. Respro, Inc., 85 R.I. 272, 129 A.2d 785, 1957 R.I. LEXIS 20 (1957).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Review.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The review provided for under the statute as to appraiser’s report was the review that the superior court, sitting in equity, was empowered to make of the report of a master in chancery.

Accordingly, after shareholders unanimously voted to dissolve a corporation, the trial court properly granted the shareholders’ petition for the appointment of a permanent receiver to oversee the liquidation and eventual dissolution of the insolvent corporation.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8">Whenever a petition for dissolution of a corporation is filed by one or more shareholders (subsequently in this section referred to as the “petitioner”) pursuant to either § 7-1.2-1314 or a right to compel dissolution which is authorized under § 7-1.2-1701 or is otherwise valid, one or more of its other shareholders may avoid the dissolution by filing with the court prior to the commencement of the hearing, or, in the discretion of the court, at any time prior to a sale or other disposition of the assets of the corporation, an election to purchase the shares owned by the petitioner at a price equal to their fair value. If the shares are to be purchased by other shareholders, notice must be sent to all shareholders of the corporation other than the petitioner, giving them an opportunity to join in the election to purchase the shares. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as to the fair value of the shares, the court shall, upon the giving of a bond or other security sufficient to assure to the petitioner payment of the value of the shares, stay the proceeding and determine the value of the shares, in accordance with the procedure set forth in § 7-1.2-1202, as of the close of business on the day on which the petition for dissolution was filed. Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall state in its order directing that the shares be purchased, the purchase price and the time within which the payment is to be made, and may decree any other terms and conditions of sale that it determines to be appropriate, including payment of the purchase price in installments extending over a period of time, and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among shareholders electing to purchase them, which, so far as practicable, are to be proportional to the number of shares previously owned. The petitioner is entitled to interest, at the rate on judgments in civil actions, on the purchase price of the shares from the date of the filing of the election to purchase the shares, and all other rights of the petitioner as owner of the shares terminate on that date. The costs of the proceeding, which include reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers but not fees and expenses of counsel or of experts retained by a party, will be allocated between or among the parties as the court determines. Upon full payment of the purchase price, under the terms and conditions specified by the court, or at any other time that is ordered by the court, the petitioner shall transfer the shares to the purchaser.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>Purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of this provision is to award prejudgment interest. Bogosian v. Woloohojian, 93 F. Supp. 2d 145, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4999 (D.R.I. 2000), modified, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22275 (D.R.I. July 6, 2000).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The language in the stock buyout statute which provides that a court “may decree such other terms and conditions of sale as it determines to be appropriate, including payment of the purchase price in installments extending over a period of time,” does not override state law which governs priorities, liens, and attachments. Bogosian v. Woloohojian, 158 F.3d 1, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 23260 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Applicability of Marketability Discount in Buying-Out Shareholders.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A lack of marketability discount is inapposite when a corporation elects to buy out a shareholder who has filed for dissolution of a corporation. Charland v. Country View Golf Club, 588 A.2d 609, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 49 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Applicability of Minority Discount in Buying-Out Shareholder.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No minority discount should be applied when a corporation elects to buy out the shareholder who petitions for dissolution of the corporation. Charland v. Country View Golf Club, 588 A.2d 609, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 49 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Court’s Power to Require Posting of Security.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whether or not this section means to provide a corporation with total freedom to change its mind and revoke a previous buyout election, the statute gives the court, faced with a buyout election and a valuation impasse, the legal power to require the corporation to post security. Bogosian v. Woloohojian Realty Corp., 923 F.2d 898, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 482 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A mortgage for $10 million, required as security for a shareholder’s one-third ownership interest in the corporation is not excessive, where the shareholder, in an affidavit, swears her shares are worth $9 million. Bogosian v. Woloohojian Realty Corp., 923 F.2d 898, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 482 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Election to Purchase.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plaintiff ceased to be a shareholder in defendant’s realty corporation on the day the corporation elected to purchase her shares rather than dissolve the corporation. Bogosian v. Woloohojian, 158 F.3d 1, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 23260 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The “appropriate” terms and conditions provision of the stock buyout statute is directed to the mechanics of the stock purchase and payment as between the company and the former shareholder, and does not allow the judge in the stock buyout case to override state lien law protecting the interests of third parties to other cases merely because the proceeds happen to derive from an award made by the judge. Bogosian v. Woloohojian, 158 F.3d 1, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 23260 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By conditioning the election to purchase shares on the owner’s shareholder status, the purchaser was merely holding the shareholder to his proof in establishing his rightful ownership of the shares, a necessary statutory precondition to the shareholder’s initiation and maintenance of a dissolution claim and to the purchaser’s invocation of his buyout election. DiLuglio v. Providence Auto Body, Inc., 755 A.2d 757, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 159 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A purchaser of shares was entitled to condition his election upon the shareholder’s rightful ownership of shares, subject to the risk that if his position challenging that ownership turned out to be a frivolous one or one taken in bad faith he would be subject to sanctions. DiLuglio v. Providence Auto Body, Inc., 755 A.2d 757, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 159 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A challenge to the validity of an election to purchase was properly rejected where a shareholder filed his election prior to the commencement of a dissolution hearing and where the parties were unable to reach an agreement as to the fair value of the shares, since the court was required to stay the dissolution proceedings and proceed with the valuation of stock. DiLuglio v. Providence Auto Body, Inc., 755 A.2d 757, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 159 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Equitable Relief.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rhode Island law authorizes equitable relief in a “buyout,” and the court may, in an appropriate case, order interim money payments. Bogosian v. Woloohojian Realty Corp., 923 F.2d 898, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 482 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Interest.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Shareholder was entitled to interest from the date of the corporation’s election to purchase her shares to the date payment was actually received, at the rate of 11%, compounded monthly. Bogosian v. Woloohojian Realty Corp., 973 F. Supp. 98, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11067 (D.R.I. 1997), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 158 F.3d 1, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 23260 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Compound prejudgment interest is not allowed under this Code section. Bogosian v. Woloohojian, 158 F.3d 1, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 23260 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Interest will not accrue after a valid tender, nor after the payment of money into a court registry. Bogosian v. Woloohojian, 158 F.3d 1, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 23260 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the intended rate for prejudgment interest could have been specified more clearly, the purpose of the provision to award prejudgment interest compels the application of the state’s prejudgment rate, not the post-judgment rate. Bogosian v. Woloohojian, 93 F. Supp. 2d 145, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4999 (D.R.I. 2000), modified, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22275 (D.R.I. July 6, 2000).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court erred in basing an interest award upon an equitable rate of interest per former § 7-1.1-74(f) (see now § 7-1.2-1202(f)); former § 7-1.1-90.1 (see now this section) limits the use of the procedures in former § 7-1.1-74 (see now § 7-1.2-1202) solely to determining the purchase price, or fair value, of the shares involved, and not to ascertaining what interest shall be awarded. DiLuglio v. Providence Auto Body, Inc., 755 A.2d 757, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 159 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because an award of compound interest in election-to-purchase proceedings was not authorized by former § 7-1.1-90.1 (see now this section), the applicable rate of interest was to be calculated according to the provisions of § 9-21-10. DiLuglio v. Providence Auto Body, Inc., 755 A.2d 757, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 159 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court was right to correct the judgment to award interest as of the date of a shareholder’s election to purchase rather than as of the date the plaintiff filed the petition for dissolution. DiLuglio v. Providence Auto Body, Inc., 755 A.2d 757, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 159 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Revocation of Election.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Revocation of a corporation’s election to purchase a stockholder’s shares was deemed inequitable toward stockholder who had been frozen out of corporate affairs and where the corporation’s fickle behavior would have changed the date on which the stockholder’s shares would be valued, to the detriment of the stockholder. Bogosian v. Woloohojian, 749 F. Supp. 396, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14666 (D.R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Taxation.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Shareholder would not be required to contribute to the tax burden of the corporation; each party would have to bear its own tax consequences. Bogosian v. Woloohojian Realty Corp., 973 F. Supp. 98, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11067 (D.R.I. 1997), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 158 F.3d 1, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 23260 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Terms and Conditions of Sale.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section authorizes the court to decree terms and conditions of sale as appropriate, but it could not consider the tax impact of the transaction until the corporation had presented its proposal for satisfaction of the purchase price and the details of how the corporation would fund the purchase. Bogosian v. Woloohojian Realty Corp., 973 F. Supp. 98, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11067 (D.R.I. 1997), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 158 F.3d 1, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 23260 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Absent the prior barring of prejudgment payments, there was no legal basis for a judge to assume that the court’s prior permission was required before such payments. Bogosian v. Woloohojian, 158 F.3d 1, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 23260 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Valuation Methods.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In valuing a corporation’s property, it is not error in using methods of valuation other than comparable sales. The use of other methods in this case was proper, if not required, in view of the weakness of the evidence concerning comparable sales, the limited market for extensive commercial building space and the substantial adjustments that were made to those sales which were claimed to be comparable. Bogosian v. Woloohojian, 882 F. Supp. 258, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5045 (D.R.I. 1995).</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> In proceedings to liquidate the assets and business of a corporation the court has general equity jurisdiction and power to issue any orders, injunctions, and decrees that justice and equity require, to appoint a receiver or receivers pendente lite, with any powers and duties that the court, from time to time, directs, and to take any other proceedings that are requisite to preserve the corporate assets wherever situated, and carry on the business of the corporation until a full hearing can be had.</p>

This subsection does not invalidate any provision in articles of incorporation, bylaws, or agreements that would otherwise be valid.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> The provisions of § 7-1.2-709 limiting the duration of a voting trust or shareholders’ agreement to ten (10) years is not applicable to a close corporation that complies with subsection (a). If close corporation status is terminated pursuant to subsection (d), the effective term of a voting trust or shareholders’ agreement is ten (10) years from the termination or the term provided therein, whichever is shorter.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(c)</b> The effect of any provision authorized by subsection (a)(1) is to relieve the directors and to impose on the individual or individuals undertaking to exercise responsibility the liability for managerial acts or omissions that would otherwise be imposed on directors to the extent that and so long as the discretion or powers of the board in its management of corporate affairs is controlled by any such provision. Action which is valid pursuant to subsection (a)(1) is deemed to be action by the board of directors for purposes of compliance with any provision of this chapter providing for action by the board of directors.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(d)</b> If a close corporation’s original or amended articles of incorporation so provide, the corporation need not hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless one or more shareholders deliver written notice to the corporation requesting a meeting at least thirty (30) days before the meeting date stated or fixed in accordance with the bylaws of the corporation.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> If any shareholder becomes ineligible, he or she shall transfer his or her shares to an eligible person or offer them to the corporation for redemption at their fair-market value. If the articles of incorporation or the bylaws of the corporation restrict transfer of its shares, and transfer of the shares to an eligible person is prevented, the corporation shall redeem the shares of the ineligible shareholder, and compensate the ineligible shareholder in full for the fair-market value of his or her shares determined as of the date that the ineligibility occurred. Nothing contained in these provisions is to be interpreted to prevent a shareholder and the corporation from making a binding agreement as to a method for determining the fair-market value or for determining what constitutes the fair-market value of his or her shares. In the event the corporation and an ineligible shareholder cannot agree as to the fair-market value, the regulatory agency excluding the division of professional regulation shall, upon application by either party, appoint a board of not less than three (3) qualified persons engaged in performing similar professional services to determine the fair-market value of the shares, and the decision of the board is final and binding upon the parties. The division of professional regulation shall, upon application by either party, appoint a neutral arbitrator with experience in business valuation whose fees will be paid by the corporation petitioner to determine the fair-market value of the shares, and the decision of the arbitrator is final and binding upon the parties. The redemption of its shares by a professional service corporation shall not be effected at a time or in a manner so as to impair or prejudice the rights or remedies of any creditor of the corporation. As used in this chapter, “ineligible shareholder” includes a shareholder electing to retire or withdraw from active employment in the corporation. Nothing contained in these provisions is to be interpreted to prohibit the temporary exercise of incidence of ownership of stock in any corporation by persons or corporate fiduciaries not authorized to practice, solely for purposes of administering estates of shareholders deceased or under legal disability to transfer their shares. For purposes of this section, “temporary incidence of ownership” means any period of time not exceeding two (2) years; and “administering estates of shareholders” shall include, but not be limited to, contracting with licensed professionals to operate the practice upon the death of the person licensed to practice.</p>

The shareholders failed to show any impropriety with regard to the bylaws and, therefore, their attempt to block the sale of the folio failed since the corporation’s action was not ultra vires.

<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> A person who offers or sells a security in violation of § 7-11-201, 7-11-301(1) or (2), 7-11-305(k), 7-11-501, 7-11-503, or 7-11-505(b) is liable to the purchaser of the security from that person. Upon tender of the security, the purchaser may recover the consideration paid for the security and interest at the legal rate of this state from the date of payment, costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees as determined by the court, less the amount of income received on the security. Tender requires only notice of willingness to exchange the security for the amount specified. If that purchaser no longer owns the security, the purchaser may recover damages. Damages are the amount that would be recoverable upon a tender less the value of the security when the purchaser disposed of it, plus interest at the legal rate of this state from the date of disposition of the security, costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees as determined by the court.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> A person who offers or sells a security in violation of § 7-11-501 or 7-11-503 is not liable under subsection (a) if:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The purchaser knew of the untrue statement of a material fact or omission of a statement of a material fact; or</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The seller did not know and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known of the untrue statement or misleading omission.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(c)</b> A person who willfully participates in an act or transaction in violation of § 7-11-502 is liable to a person who purchases or sells a security, other than a security traded on a national securities exchange or quoted on a national automated quotation system administered by a self regulatory organization, at a price that was affected by the act or transaction for the damages sustained as a result of the act or transaction. Damages are the amount that would be recoverable upon a tender less the value of the security when the purchaser or seller disposed of it, plus interest at the legal rate of this state from the date of disposition of the security, costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees as determined by the court.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(d)</b> A person who directly or indirectly controls another person who is liable under subsection (a) or (c), a partner, officer, or director of the person liable, a person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, an employee of the person liable if the employee materially aids in the act, omission or transaction constituting the violation, and a broker-dealer or sales representative who materially aids in the act, omission, or transaction constituting the violation, are also liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as the other person, but it is a defense that the person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of the facts by which the liability is alleged to exist. Regarding a person who, directly or indirectly, controls another person who is liable under subsection (c) of this section, it is also a defense that the controlling person acted in good faith and did not, directly or indirectly, induce the act, omission, or transaction constituting the violation. Contribution among the several persons liable is the same as in cases arising out of breach of contract.</p>

The members of the partnership so proceeded against are permitted to set off any demand against the creditor that could have been set off had the suit been against all the individuals composing the firm. They may avail themselves of any defense that would have been available had not this chapter been passed, except that they shall not set up the discharge of one individual as a discharge of all the other copartners, unless it appears that all were intended to be discharged.</p>

Such certificate of the secretary of state shall be prima facie evidence of the conversion by such limited partnership out of the state of Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(d)</b> The conversion of a limited partnership out of the state of Rhode Island in accordance with this section and the resulting cessation of its existence as a limited partnership of the state of Rhode Island pursuant to a certificate of conversion to a non-Rhode Island entity shall not be deemed to affect any obligations or liabilities of the limited partnership incurred prior to such conversion or the personal liability of any person incurred prior to such conversion, nor shall it be deemed to affect the choice of laws applicable to the limited partnership with respect to matters arising prior to such conversion.</p>

The rights, privileges, powers, and interests in property of the limited partnership that has converted, as well as the debts, liabilities and duties of such limited partnership, shall not be deemed, as a consequence of the conversion, to have been transferred to the other entity or business form to which such limited partnership has converted for any purpose of the laws of the state of Rhode Island.</p>

Any income accruing to, or derived from, an enterprise or an interest in an enterprise that has been ordered forfeited under this section may be used to offset ordinary and necessary expenses of the enterprise as required by law and expenses that are necessary to protect the interests of the state or innocent third parties.</p>

The hearing shall be held by the court without a jury.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The petition shall be signed by the petitioner under penalty of perjury and shall set forth the nature and extent of the petitioner’s right, title, or interest in the property; the time and circumstances of the petitioner’s acquisition of the right, title, or interest in the property; any additional facts supporting the petitioner’s claim; and the relief sought.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>Limitations Period.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This chapter contains no specific period of limitations; it can therefore be assumed that the general six-year (now ten-year) limitation for civil actions governs. Boyajian v. DeFusco, 862 F.2d 933 (1st Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Refusal to Discharge Mortgage.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the mortgagee acted well within its rights when refusing to give advance assurance that it would discharge the property mortgage, the defendants’ counterclaims based upon alleged violations of Rhode Island’s extortion statute, § 11-42-2, and the state’s anti-racketeering law must be dismissed; the mortgagee’s duty to discharge was simply never triggered. National Credit Union Admin. Bd. v. Regine, 795 F. Supp. 59, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7577 (D.R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Reliance on Representations.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the plaintiff produced no evidence of detrimental reliance on a defendant’s representations, the racketeering count against the defendant was dismissed. National Credit Union Admin. Bd. v. Regine, 795 F. Supp. 59, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7577 (D.R.I. 1992).</p>

<p class="p6"><b>Scope of Remedy.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO) provides a civil remedy only for injury to business or property. Martin v. Fleet Nat'l Bank, 676 F. Supp. 423, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12420 (D.R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claims of personal psychic injuries and emotional distress are not cognizable in a civil action under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO). Martin v. Fleet Nat'l Bank, 676 F. Supp. 423, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12420 (D.R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Standing.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff, former insurance company employee, lacked standing to bring suit against his former employer under this section where alleged injuries resulting from termination of employment were not injuries to business or property and therefore were unconnected to the alleged offenses. Vitone v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 943 F. Supp. 192, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15465 (D.R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Sufficiency of Complaint.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Complaint alleging that credit union officials engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obtain property from the credit union was sufficient to state a claim under this chapter. National Credit Union Admin. Bd. v. Regine, 749 F. Supp. 401, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14099 (D.R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the theft of services, or the theft of the value of those services, is not larceny under Rhode Island law, the taking of services by false pretenses is an insufficient predicate to support the state civil RICO claim. Vitone v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 954 F. Supp. 37, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 510 (D.R.I. 1997).</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> Title to all property forfeited pursuant to this chapter, except for that property awarded by the court to the victims of violations of the chapter pursuant to § 7-15-4(c), vests in the state of Rhode Island. There is established within the general treasury of the state a special fund to be known as the asset forfeiture fund in which shall be deposited all proceeds of any forfeitures. Where the forfeited property is a vessel, vehicle, aircraft, or other personal property the use of which reasonably relates to law enforcement duties, title to the property may be transferred to the law enforcement agency that seized it. Where the forfeited property is personal property the use of which is not reasonably related to law enforcement duties and where the forfeited property is real estate or an interest in real estate, it shall be sold under the direction of the general treasurer and the proceeds of the sale deposited in the asset forfeiture fund. Where the forfeited property consists of negotiable instruments, securities, or other intangible property, it shall be maintained by the general treasurer as part of the asset forfeiture fund and may be sold at his or her discretion and the proceeds deposited in the fund. Where the forfeited property consists of money, both coin and currency, it shall be deposited in the asset forfeiture fund.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The compromise and payment of claims against property forfeited pursuant to this chapter, provided that any payment in settlement of a claim that is in excess of twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500) from the fund must be approved by the presiding justice of the superior court or an associate justice of the court designated by him or her;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> The payment of twenty-five percent (25%) of the net proceeds of a forfeiture to the Rhode Island law enforcement agency or agencies that accomplished the seizure to be used only for the purposes of future investigations of racketeering activity as defined in these provisions. No law enforcement agency of the state is entitled to keep more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) per calendar year under this section. No law enforcement agency of a city or town with a population in excess of twenty thousand (20,000) is entitled to keep more than thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) per calendar year under this section. No law enforcement agency of a city or town with a population of twenty thousand (20,000) or less is entitled to keep more than fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) per calendar year under this section.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(c)</b> The attorney general shall report each forfeiture pursuant to this chapter to the general treasurer within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the judgment of forfeiture by the court.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(d)</b> Upon the application of any law enforcement agency of the state of Rhode Island when a special need exists concerning the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, the attorney general may apply to the presiding justice of the superior court for the release from the general treasury of sums of money not to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) per investigation. When the presiding justice, upon consideration of the reasons set forth by the agency, deems the funds to be reasonable and necessary to the accomplishment of a goal within the powers and duties of the law enforcement agency, he or she may issue an order ex parte providing for the release of the funds.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(e)</b> The attorney general and the general treasurer shall transmit to the general assembly no later than February 1 of each year, a detailed report on the nature and value of the assets forfeited and their disposition, on the amounts deposited in the fund, and a detailed description of withdrawals from the fund and the uses of the withdrawals, during the previous calendar year, but shall not make any disclosure that would compromise any investigation or prosecution.</p>

The time allowed for compliance with the demand in whole or in part as deemed proper and ordered by the court shall not run during the pendency of the petition in the court.

However, the grant of immunity does not immunize the witness from civil liability arising from the transactions about which testimony is given, and he or she may nevertheless be prosecuted or subjected to penalty or forfeiture for any perjury, false swearing, or contempt committed in answering or in failing to answer or in producing evidence or failing to do so in accordance with the order. If a person refuses to testify after being granted immunity from prosecution and after being ordered to testify, he or she may be adjudged in civil contempt by the superior court until any time that he or she purges him or herself of contempt by testifying, producing documentary material or presenting written answers as ordered. The above does not prevent the attorney general from instituting other appropriate contempt proceedings against any person who violates any of the above provisions.</p>

If the limited-liability company agreement does not specify the manner of authorizing a conversion of the limited-liability company or a merger or consolidation that involves the limited-liability company as a constituent party and does not prohibit a conversion of the limited-liability company, the conversion shall be authorized by the approval by the members or, if there is more than one class or group of members, then by each class or group of members, in either case, by members who own more than fifty percent (50%) of the then-current percentage or other interest in the profits of the domestic limited-liability company owned by all of the members or by the members in each class or group, as appropriate.</p>

When a limited-liability company has converted to another entity or business form pursuant to this section, for all purposes of the laws of the state of Rhode Island, the other entity or business form shall be deemed to be the same entity as the converting limited-liability company and conversion shall constitute a continuation of the existence of the limited-liability company in the form of such other entity or business form.</p>

The rights, privileges, powers, and interests in property of the limited-liability company that has converted, as well as the debts, liabilities, and duties of the limited-liability company, shall not be deemed, as a consequence of the conversion, to have been transferred to the other entity or business form to which the limited-liability company has converted for any purpose of the laws of the state of Rhode Island.</p>

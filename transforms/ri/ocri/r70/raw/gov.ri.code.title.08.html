<p class="p7"><b>Bills of Exceptions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The bill of exceptions given by the statute has practically superseded the writ of error, as by it the record can be brought before the court for examination before the entry of judgment, but the supreme court still has power to issue the writ. Newhall v. Egan, 28 R.I. 584, 68 A. 471, 1908 R.I. LEXIS 69 (1908).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The jurisdiction conferred upon the supreme court by R.I. Const., amend. XII is undoubtedly broad enough to include questions of law arising in a divorce case, the method of presenting such questions being by bill of exceptions. Thrift v. Thrift, 30 R.I. 357, 75 A. 484, 1910 R.I. LEXIS 27 (1910).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court has jurisdiction of bill of exceptions brought to review an alleged abuse of discretion of superior court in dismissing complaint. Fox v. Artesian Well &amp; Supply Co., 34 R.I. 260, 83 A. 115, 1912 R.I. LEXIS 46 (1912).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A bill of exceptions will not lie from the decision of the justice upon a petition to vacate a divorce decree procured by fraud on the petitioner; an appeal is the correct procedure. Tobin v. Tobin, 70 R.I. 362, 38 A.2d 756, 1944 R.I. LEXIS 55 (1944).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A bill of exceptions is the medium by which rulings and decisions made by the superior court prior to judgment are reviewed by the supreme court and may also be used to review supplementary rulings after judgment, such as one taxing costs. Valentine v. Knox, 45 R.I. 429, 123 A. 600, 1924 R.I. LEXIS 18 (1924), limited, In re Lanni, 47 R.I. 158, 131 A. 52, 1925 R.I. LEXIS 75 (1925).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Bill of exceptions was not proper remedy to review decision of superior court, but in view of fact that case was of first impression, statute provided for no ordinary appellate proceedings, and trial court held different views as to procedure, supreme court would treat bill of exceptions as certiorari and grant relief to which plaintiff was entitled. Carlson v. McLyman, 77 R.I. 177, 74 A.2d 853, 1950 R.I. LEXIS 65 (1950).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Criminal Sentence Review.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even in the absence of express statutory authority the supreme court has implied statutory and state constitutional power to review a sentence imposed under a sentencing statute. The role in reviewing excessive sentence claims, however, is a limited one; it is to be exercised only in the exceptional instance. State v. McGranahan, 415 A.2d 1298, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1652 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Original Appellate Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A portion of the supervisory jurisdiction of the supreme court was given to the superior court by C.P.A. 1905, § 12 (§ 8-2-16). Higgins v. Tax Assessors, 27 R.I. 401, 63 A. 34, 1905 R.I. LEXIS 106 (1905).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court was not deprived of its revisory jurisdiction by P.L. 1912, ch. 896, which provided the decree of the superior court confirming a decision of the commission established under said act should be final and binding, since such clause must be construed to mean final in the superior court, but subject to revision by the supreme court. In re Pawtucket &amp; Cent. Falls Grade Crossing Comm'n, 36 R.I. 200, 89 A. 695, 1914 R.I. LEXIS 11 (1914).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the provisions of this section where a statute expressly gives original appellate jurisdiction to a court other than the supreme court, such original appellate jurisdiction is exclusive and not in conflict with R.I. Const., amend. XII, § 1, which gives the supreme court final revisory and appellate jurisdiction; and this final jurisdiction cannot be availed of until rights in the court of original appellate jurisdiction have been exhausted and its requirements met. MacKenzie &amp; Shea v. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Co., 45 R.I. 407, 122 A. 774, 1923 R.I. LEXIS 85 (1923).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-53-5 does not provide for a direct appeal from an adverse substantial completeness determination made by the Rhode Island State Housing Appeals Board pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-53-6(f)(1); however, pursuant to R.I. Const. art. 10, § 2, relief may be sought in the Rhode Island Supreme Court by way of a writ of certiorari. New Harbor Vill., LLC v. Town of New Shoreham Zoning Bd. of Review, 894 A.2d 901, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 39 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Petitions in Probate Matters.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the original account filed in a probate matter was not a proper accounting and a new trial in the superior court would merely result in a prolongation of the case, the case is one calling for the exercise of the power of the court to reverse the decree of the superior court to the end that an account in proper form may be newly filed in the probate court. Stillman v. Moore, 28 R.I. 548, 68 A. 726, 1908 R.I. LEXIS 81 (1908).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section did not give supreme court jurisdiction to grant permission to file a belated probate appeal claiming undue influence, lack of capacity and lack of knowledge of probate although residence was known to executors and sole beneficiaries. Walquist v. Hodson, 53 R.I. 322, 166 A. 546, 1933 R.I. LEXIS 91 (1933).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In will construction under G.L. 1923, ch. 339, § 35 (former § 9-24-28) all persons in being having an interest in the income or principal of a trust estate should be made parties, the minor living children should be represented by guardians ad litem, and a suitable disinterested person should be appointed by superior court to represent persons not in being or ascertainable, but supreme court held control by remanding to amend by proceeding as above and allowing necessary pleading and argument. Industrial Trust Co. v. Wilson, 58 R.I. 378, 192 A. 821, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 55 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>After refusal to answer question certified concerning power of superior court to approve compromise of infant’s claim under will, supreme court would not permit filing of original petition by infant’s guardian ad litem for such approval, because such a question would not be a matter of general supervision of a court of inferior jurisdiction under this section. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Co. v. Davis, 68 R.I. 461, 29 A.2d 647, 1942 R.I. LEXIS 95 (1942).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Power to Issue Writs Generally.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court in the exercise of its jurisdiction to issue writs is not confined to any narrow definition of a particular writ but may adapt or modify any writ suitable for the matter in hand in order to further justice and secure due administration of law. Hyde v. Superior Court, 28 R.I. 204, 66 A. 292, 1907 R.I. LEXIS 20 (1907).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court has the power to issue a writ restraining the acting secretary of state from issuing a commission and restraining the candidate from acting as judge under such commission when the judge was found not to have been properly elected under the law. Carpenter v. Sprague, 45 R.I. 29, 119 A. 561, 1923 R.I. LEXIS 9 (1923).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court has authority derived from R.I. Const., amend. XII (see now R.I. Const., art. X, § 2 et seq.) to issue a prerogative writ of injunction, but such authority has never been conferred upon the superior court. Boss v. Sprague, 53 R.I. 1, 162 A. 710, 1932 R.I. LEXIS 98 (1932).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Art. 10, § 2, R.I. Const., vests the Supreme Court with the power to issue prerogative writs. The power to issue such writs is not confined by any narrow definition of a particular writ, and the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to adapt, to modify, or to frame new writs to meet the needs of the judicial system. This jurisdiction provides the court with flexibility to further justice which may not be provided in current statutes. Estate of Sherman v. Almeida, 610 A.2d 104, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 148 (R.I. 1992).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Divorce and Ancillary Matters.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statutory expansion of Family Court jurisdiction indicates a clear legislative intent to furnish to parties who have filed a petition for divorce, separation, or other relief in the Family Court, a comprehensive resolution of property, contractual, and equitable disputes that have arisen between them. By the same token, the legislature did not intend to diminish the general equitable powers that had been conferred upon the Superior Court from its inception. Lubecki v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens, </i>when an alternative forum has jurisdiction to hear a case, and when trial in the chosen forum would establish oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant out of all proportion to plaintiff’s convenience, or when the chosen forum is inappropriate because of considerations affecting the court’s own administrative and legal problems, the court may, in the exercise of its sound discretion, dismiss the case on <i>forum non conveniens </i>grounds, even if jurisdiction and proper venue are established. Kedy v. A.W. Chesterton Co., 946 A.2d 1171, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 68 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The <i>forum non conveniens </i>inquiry consists of a two-prong analysis. First, the court must decide whether an alternative forum exists that is both available and adequate to resolve the disputed legal issues. Second, the court must determine the inconvenience of continuing in the plaintiff’s chosen forum by weighing private- and public-interest factors. The defendant carries the burden of persuasion at each stage of the <i>forum non conveniens </i>inquiry. Kedy v. A.W. Chesterton Co., 946 A.2d 1171, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 68 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although jurisdiction and venue existed in Rhode Island as to asbestos litigation cases that were brought by Canadian residents against corporations that did business in Rhode Island, dismissal of the cases was proper because the private-interest and public-interest factors favored the dismissal of the cases under the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens </i>in spite of the deference to which the alleged victims’ choice of forum was entitled.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While it is the right of the trial justice, in the exercise of his discretion, to state to the jury the testimony and other evidence bearing upon the issues, he should always be exceedingly careful not to deprive either party of a fair trial by either consciously or unconsciously conveying to the jury his impression as to the proper weight to be given to any of the testimony. State v. Gallogly, 47 R.I. 483, 134 A. 20, 1926 R.I. LEXIS 88 (1926).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section a trial justice has considerable latitude in commenting to the jury on the evidence if he makes it clear that in arriving at the verdict the responsibility of determining credibility and weight of the evidence is upon them alone.

<p class="p7"><b>Erroneous Instructions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in granting a new trial to plaintiffs in an auto negligence case based on the giving of erroneous jury instructions; although the trial court erred in giving a rear-end collision instruction, the error was harmless, and the fact that a truck driver was suddenly confronted with a pick-up truck spinning out of control just 360 feet ahead of him constituted a sudden emergency that warranted the sudden emergency instruction given by the court.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s conviction of first-degree robbery was affirmed, because the trial court’s instruction to the jury on the issue of reasonable doubt satisfied the requirements of R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><b>Appointment and Confirmation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is a distinction between a confirmation of an appointment and the appointment itself. Confirmation is a separate and distinct function that makes the appointment of a qualified candidate valid and final, vesting entitlement to the office for the entire statutory term in that appointed person. However, confirmation is not needed to make a valid appointment, thereby creating a vacancy. Seemann v. Kinch, 606 A.2d 1308, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 81 (R.I. 1992).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An incumbent holds the position for five years and thereafter may continue as a holdover until a successor is both appointed and qualified. Appointing is the executive function of naming a party to the position and is performed by the Governor according to statute. The process of qualification consists of the appointee’s taking the oath of office and posting a bond for the position before entering office. Seemann v. Kinch, 606 A.2d 1308, 1992 R.I.

<p class="p7"><b>Construction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature evidently intended the words “for the balance of the unexpired term” to limit the authority of the governor to fill a vacancy in the office of the clerk of the superior court for the counties of Providence and Bristol resulting from the death of an incumbent who had been duly appointed or elected to a definite term, and not for the purpose of limiting the time for which such appointee would serve, the word “unexpired” controlling the situation, it preceding in the context the word “term” so as to modify it and not the word “balance.” Casey v.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> In all civil and criminal cases, in workers’ compensation, district, family, and superior court proceedings, mental health court competency hearings, state traffic tribunals, and in any case in any municipal court, including, but not limited to, on-site, court-provided, alternative dispute resolution, mediation, arbitration, diversion/intervention program or treatment; and in an administrative, commission, or agency hearing; pursuant to chapter 18 of this title, where a party or a witness is a person who is deaf, hard of hearing, or deaf-blind, or a juvenile whose parent or parents are deaf, hard of hearing, or deaf-blind is brought before a court for any reason, he or she shall have the proceedings accessible to him or her in a language that he or she can understand by a sign language interpreter/transliterator or CART provider appointed by the court. In any case where a sign language interpreter/transliterator or CART provider is required to be appointed by the court under this section, the court shall not commence proceedings until the appointed sign language interpreter/transliterator or CART provider is in court in a position not exceeding ten feet (10´) from, and in full view of the person who is deaf, hard of hearing, or deaf-blind. The sign language interpreter/transliterator or CART provider appointed under the terms of the section shall be required to take an oath that he or she will make a legally equivalent, linguistically true interpretation, transliteration, or transcription for the person who is deaf, hard of hearing, or deaf-blind of all the proceedings or hearings of the case or claim in a language that he or she understands; and will orally transfer the meaning of the answer to questions and any other statements of the person who is deaf, hard of hearing, or deaf-blind to counsel, the court, and jury in the English language with exactitude, while accurately reflecting the form and content of the linguistic and paralinguistic elements of the speaker’s discourse.</p>
<p class="p6">Assistive listening devices, or other reasonable and effective auxiliary aids available, shall be provided for the deaf, hard of hearing, and deaf-blind who need to maximize their engagement in the proceedings or hearings in addition to the interpreter/transliterator and/or CART providers.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> For the purposes of this section, “sign language interpreter/transliterator” means a person who is a certified interpreter as defined in § 5-71-3 in providing the interpreting and transliterating services for the deaf, hard of hearing, and deaf-blind. “CART provider” means a person who is a qualified communication access realtime translation (CART) service provider certified by the National Court Reporters Association. “Paralinguistic elements” means a non-verbal element of language, including all of the pauses, hedges, self-corrections, hesitations, and emotion as they are conveyed through tone of voice, word choice, level of formality, tone of voice, and intonation. “Assistive listening device (ALD) or assistive listening system (ALS)” means instruments that are designed to improve a person’s ability to hear in specific listening situations. Some ALDs amplify a sound signal, but the primary purpose of an ALD is to make the targeted sound easier to hear by isolating the sound source from surrounding noise. Examples are induction loop systems, frequency-modulated (FM) systems, infrared systems, and personal amplifiers. A sign language interpreter/transliterator, or CART provider shall be deemed qualified in accordance with United States Department of Justice regulations effectuating Title II of the federal “Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,” as from time to time may be amended, Pub. L. 101-336, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., including regulations, analysis, and technical assistance and as determined by the definition of chapter 71 of title 5 and the commission on the deaf and hard of hearing, based upon recommendations from the National Association of the Deaf, the National Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, the National Hearing Loss Association of America, and other appropriate agencies. The commission on the deaf and hard of hearing shall coordinate all requests for qualified sign language interpreters/transliterators and CART providers and shall maintain a list of all such sign language interpreters/transliterators and CART providers from which it shall fill such requests. No sign language interpreter/transliterator or CART provider is precluded from being further examined by the court system.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Sign language interpreters/transliterators and CART providers appointed under the terms of the section shall be paid by the state or municipality a reasonable compensation fixed by the court.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Contempt.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An award of counsel fees to make an innocent party whole is within the discretion of the court finding contempt, and need not be accompanied by an award for compensatory damages as it is independent of other possible sanctions.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a suit filed by a town seeking to enjoin excavation ordinance violations by a limited liability company (LLC) and the LLC’s member, the member was properly held in contempt because the member not only admitted to five separate violations of previous orders, but also agreed that the trial court could institute any penalty found proper, including incarceration, so, by submitting to this order, the member consented to the contempt finding and waived the member’s right to appeal.

Warren v. Warren, 36 R.I. 167, 89 A. 651, 1914 R.I. LEXIS 10 (1914).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where family court had entered interlocutory decree and awarded custody of daughter to husband, it also had authority to enter order finding husband, who traveled to Israel with daughter without notifying wife or court and without attempting to comply with decree provision to effect that parties attempt to arrange reasonable visitation rights, in deliberate contempt of decree and to enjoin and restrain the husband from presenting any final decree of divorce for entry in court until he purged himself of contempt by immediately returning daughter to the state and jurisdiction of court.

<p class="p7"><b>Purpose of Rules.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The evident intent of the legislature was to confer upon the courts power to facilitate progress in the conduct of litigation by the making and promulgating of rules for regulating practice and conducting business.

<p class="p7"><b>Rule Changes.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court properly denied a contractor’s motion to compel, inter alia, the production of all materials and documents developed and considered by a subcontractor’s testifying expert in formulating his written opinions because Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)(A) was confined by its very terms to expert witness discovery through interrogatories or deposition, any change to the rule had to come from the superior court in accordance with this section, and Rhode Island had twice rejected the language in the federal rule requiring disclosure of “the data or other information considered by the witness in forming the opinions.” Cashman Equip.

Cole v. Davis Auto. Co., 33 R.I. 143, 80 A. 268, 1911 R.I. LEXIS 112 (1911).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rule making power of superior court conferred by this section is confined to regulating the pleading, practice and procedure therein. Therefore rule which required notice to adversary of all pleadings, motions “and other paper” could not be construed to extend to a written claim for a jury trial. Dyer v. Keefe, 97 R.I. 418, 198 A.2d 159, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 102 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Tax Records.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Though, because of this section, no court can promulgate a rule of practice which requires a party to produce income tax returns, a court is not without power to order a party to do so; this section only makes certain that a trial justice will never be able to rely casually on a potential court rule that mandates the production of income tax returns whenever requested.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The presiding justice of the superior court may promulgate rules and regulations providing for compulsory and/or noncompulsory nonbinding arbitration of such category or categories of civil actions filed in, or appealed to, the superior court as he or she shall determine. The matter shall be heard by a single arbitrator who shall be selected by mutual agreement of the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s). If, after thirty (30) days, the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s) are unable to agree upon the selection of an arbitrator, a justice of the superior court shall select the arbitrator upon request in writing from either party. The costs of arbitration shall be borne by the Rhode Island state court system and a reasonable cost of the arbitration, not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500) per case, may be assessed and apportioned to each of the parties by the superior court pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the presiding justice of the superior court consistent with § 8-6-6. The assessed costs received from the parties shall be deposited into the general fund. Any party dissatisfied with the decision of the arbitrator may demand a trial by jury if one was timely claimed in the complaint or answer, or a trial by judge if no jury trial was claimed. The decision of the arbitrator shall not be admissible at the trial. The court may require a party who rejects an arbitrator’s award and demands a trial to post a three hundred dollar ($300) filing fee and pay a technology surcharge in accordance with § 8-15-11. The filing fee shall be posted with the superior court arbitration office and deposited into an arbitration fund restricted-receipt account established under the control of the state court director of finance. The arbitration funds shall not be subject to the indirect cost recoveries provisions set forth in § 35-4-27. If more than one party rejects the arbitrator’s award and demands a trial, the filing fee, first received in the arbitration office, shall designate the party rejecting the award. Should the verdict at trial be more favorable to the party than the arbitrator’s award, the filing fee shall be reimbursed to that party. Should the verdict be equal to, or less favorable to, the party than the arbitrator’s award, the filing fee posted shall be forfeited as a sanction. If forfeited as a sanction, the fee shall remain available for program expenses from the arbitration fund restricted-receipt account. The presiding justice of the superior court shall be authorized to retain the services of qualified arbitrators and to direct payment for such services and other related expenses from the arbitration fund restricted-receipt account and may appoint an administrator of the arbitration program for a ten-year (10) term and until a successor is appointed and qualified.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Veterans and active military, Reserve, and National Guard service members have provided, or are currently providing, an invaluable service to our country. In doing so, many return and suffer from mental health injuries, including, but not limited to, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, acute stress, and other injuries that may affect brain function and may also suffer drug and alcohol dependency or co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse problems.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> While the vast majority of returning military do not have contact with the justice system and are well adjusted, contributing members of society, there exists a growing number of defendants appearing in the district court who have served in the United States armed forces and are involved in the criminal justice system as a result of the above-referenced diagnoses.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> As a grateful state, we must continue to honor the service of these participants by providing them an alternative to incarceration when feasible, permitting them instead to obtain proper treatment for mental health and substance abuse problems that have resulted from military service through a jail diversion program/treatment program that recognizes their special set of circumstances while at the same time providing accountability for their wrong doing and providing for the safety of the public.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> <b>Declaration of policy.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is hereby declared to be the policy of the state of Rhode Island to successfully rehabilitate participants by providing the tools and skills necessary to address their unique challenges and to develop the insight to reintegrate successfully into society and maintain a productive and law-abiding lifestyle within the community.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> <b>Establishment.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To accomplish this purpose in an effort to direct defendants who have served in the United States armed forces into a court program that integrates support and treatment plans with the judicial process that will result in potential jail diversion, possible reduction of charges, or alternatives in sentencing, there shall be established a separate calendar within the jurisdiction of the district court for hearing, trial and disposition of certain offenses.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> <b>Veterans’ treatment calendar.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The chief judge of the district court shall create a veterans’ treatment calendar in the district court and shall assign personnel to the extent warranted to exclusively hear and decide all criminal actions involving offenses committed by defendants accepted into the program, and the calendar shall be referred to as the “veterans’ treatment court.”</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> <b>Use of section.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under no circumstances shall the defendant(s) be permitted to use this section as a basis for a dismissal of an action, as this section is enacted for the benefit and convenience of the district court.</p>

Effective July 1, 2012, all active judges, whether engaged before or after December 31, 1989, shall have deducted from compensation as defined in § 36-8-1(8) an amount equal to twelve percent (12%) of compensation.

<p class="p6">A taxpayer’s right to file a complaint pursuant to § 8-8-25 for review of a final decision of the tax administrator ordering an assessment, deficiency, or otherwise shall be conditional upon prepayment of all taxes, interest, and penalties set forth in the assessment, deficiency, or otherwise; provided, however, that in lieu of the prepayment, the taxpayer may file together with his or her complaint a motion for an exemption from the prepayment requirement. The taxpayer shall set the motion down for hearing within twenty (20) days after the answer to the complaint is filed; otherwise, the motion shall be deemed to be denied. The court shall grant the motion if it determines both: (1) that the taxpayer has a reasonable probability of success on the merits; and (2) that the taxpayer is unable to prepay all taxes, interest, and penalties set forth in the assessment, deficiency, or otherwise. In making its determination on the issue of ability to prepay, the court shall consider not only the taxpayer’s own financial resources but also the ability of the taxpayer to borrow the required funds. If the motion is denied, the taxpayer shall make prepayment within thirty (30) days of the entry of the court’s order denying the motion; otherwise, the complaint shall be dismissed upon motion of the tax administrator.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> There is hereby established a traffic tribunal which shall be charged with the administration and adjudication of traffic violations within its jurisdiction. The traffic tribunal shall be under the supervision of the chief magistrate of the traffic tribunal, who shall be the administrative head of the traffic tribunal and shall have the power to make rules for regulating practice, procedure and business within the traffic tribunal. Pursuant to § 8-6-2, said rules shall be subject to the approval of the supreme court. Such rules, when effective, shall supersede any statutory regulation in conflict therewith. Any person who has been a member of the bar of Rhode Island may be appointed chief magistrate of the traffic tribunal. The chief magistrate of the traffic tribunal shall be appointed by the chief justice of the supreme court, with the advice and consent of the senate, for a period of ten (10) years and until a successor is appointed and qualified. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit the reappointment of the chief magistrate for one or more ten (10) year terms subject to the advice and consent of the senate. Compensation for the chief magistrate shall be equal to that of an associate judge of the district court.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The judges and magistrates of the traffic tribunal shall hear and determine cases as provided by law. No district court judge appointed pursuant to chapter 8 of this title shall be assigned to perform duties of a judge or magistrate of the traffic tribunal under this chapter. The chief magistrate of the traffic tribunal may assign a judge or magistrate who is authorized to hear and decide cases in the traffic tribunal to serve as administrative judge or magistrate of the traffic tribunal and the administrative judge or magistrate shall perform such administrative duties as may be delegated to him or her by the chief magistrate. Once assigned to the position, the administrative judge or magistrate shall hold said administrative position for the remainder of his or her respective term as a judge or magistrate of the traffic tribunal.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c) (1)</b> Those judges of the administrative adjudication court in active service on July 1, 1999 shall serve within the traffic tribunal. Whenever the total number of judges and magistrates in the traffic tribunal exclusive of the chief magistrate shall be less than seven (7), the chief justice of the supreme court, with the advice and consent of the senate, may, as needed, assign a duly qualified member of the bar of this state to act as a magistrate to fill such vacancy and shall submit his or her name to the senate for confirmation. In the event of a vacancy in the position of chief magistrate, the chief justice of the supreme court shall appoint a successor in accordance with subsection 8-8.2-1(a). Any magistrate assigned under this section shall serve a term of ten (10) years and until a successor is appointed and qualified, and shall be in the unclassified service of the state. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the assignment of a magistrate to more than one such term, subject to the advice and consent of the senate. Compensation for any such magistrate shall in no event be equal to or more than that of an associate judge of the district court. Magistrates of the traffic tribunal shall participate in the state retirement system in the same manner as all members of the unclassified service.</p>

<p class="p6">In any town where the town council regularly sits as the probate court, the town council may appoint annually a member of the bar of the state of Rhode Island to be available to sit as judge of the probate court and may fill any vacancy occurring in the office of that appointee. Whenever a party to any contested matter in the probate court of the town shall so request, the town council acting as the probate court of the town shall designate the appointee to sit as a judge of the probate court to hear and determine that particular contested probate matter and the request and designation shall be recorded in the records of the probate court, and thereupon the appointee shall have the power and be subjected to the duties of the probate court with respect to the matter; provided, however, that if the appointee is a party to or interested in the matter, or is unable to perform his or her duties, no such designation shall be made. The probate clerk shall attend all hearings and record all proceedings before the appointee. The appointee shall not be entitled to any fees of the probate court, and the probate court shall be entitled to the same fees as if the designation had not been made. The appointee shall be entitled to receive from the town such compensation as it may allow.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where petition for divorce was brought in superior court, returnable to superior court after establishment of family court, and proceeding was transferred to family court and decision rendered for petitioner when respondent failed to appear, the respondent should have been granted a hearing on her motion, filed within six months of decision, to vacate decision and reinstate cause for hearing on ground that she did not believe the citation returnable to the superior court was valid.

<p class="p6">This chapter shall be liberally construed to the end that families whose unity or well-being is threatened shall be assisted and protected, and restored, if possible, as secure units of law-abiding members; that each child coming within the jurisdiction of the family court shall receive the care, guidance and control which will conduce to his or her welfare and the best interests of the state; and that when a child is removed from the control of his or her parents, the family court shall secure for him or her care as nearly as possible equivalent to that which his or her parents should have given him or her.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The family court act, as the title clearly indicates, deals exclusively with matters affecting the family unit and the well-being and preservation thereof. A careful reading of the act shows that in establishing that court the legislature intended to transfer to it the duty and responsibility of hearing and determining practically all problems and disputes affecting the family unit. State v. Zittel, 94 R.I. 235, 94 R.I. 325, 180 A.2d 455, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 78 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Providing of Post-Secondary Education.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where no exceptional circumstances existed which would have required a natural parent to provide post-secondary education for petitioner, the family court had no authority to require the Department for Children and Their Families to do so as parens patriae.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> There is hereby established a family court, consisting of a chief judge and eleven (11) associate justices, to hear and determine all petitions for divorce from the bond of marriage and from bed and board; all motions for allowance, alimony, support and custody of children, allowance of counsel and witness fees, and other matters arising out of petitions and motions relative to real and personal property in aid thereof, including, but not limited to, partitions, accountings, receiverships, sequestration of assets, resulting and constructive trust, impressions of trust, and such other equitable matters arising out of the family relationship, wherein jurisdiction is acquired by the court by the filing of petitions for divorce, bed and board and separate maintenance; all motions for allowance for support and educational costs of children attending high school at the time of their eighteenth (18th) birthday and up to ninety (90) days after high school graduation, but in no case beyond their nineteenth (19th) birthday; enforcement of any order or decree granting alimony and/or child support, and/or custody and/or visitation of any court of competent jurisdiction of another state; modification of any order or decree granting alimony and/or custody and/or visitation of any court of competent jurisdiction of another state on the ground that there has been a change of circumstances; modification of any order or decree granting child support of any court of competent jurisdiction of another state provided: (1) the order has been registered in Rhode Island for the purposes of modification pursuant to § 15-23.1-611, or (2) Rhode Island issued the order and has continuing exclusive jurisdiction over the parties; antenuptial agreements, property settlement agreements and all other contracts between persons, who at the time of execution of the contracts, were husband and wife or planned to enter into that relationship; complaints for support of parents and children; those matters relating to delinquent, wayward, dependent, neglected, or children with disabilities who by reason of any disability requires special education or treatment and other related services; to hear and determine all petitions for guardianship of any child who has been placed in the care, custody, and control of the department for children, youth, and families pursuant to the provisions of chapter 1 of title 14 and chapter 11 of title 40; adoption of children under eighteen (18) years of age; change of names of children under the age of eighteen (18) years; paternity of children born out of wedlock and provision for the support and disposition of such children or their mothers; child marriages; those matters referred to the court in accordance with the provisions of § 14-1-28; those matters relating to adults who shall be involved with paternity of children born out of wedlock; responsibility for or contributing to the delinquency, waywardness, or neglect of children under sixteen (16) years of age; desertion, abandonment, or failure to provide subsistence for any children dependent upon such adults for support; neglect to send any child to school as required by law; bastardy proceedings and custody to children in proceedings, whether or not supported by petitions for divorce or separate maintenance or for relief without commencement of divorce proceedings; and appeals of administrative decisions concerning setoff of income tax refunds for past due child support in accordance with §§ 44-30.1-5 and 40-6-21. The holding of real estate as tenants by the entirety shall not in and of itself preclude the family court from partitioning real estate so held for a period of six (6) months after the entry of final decree of divorce.</p>

Richtmyer v. Richtmyer, 461 A.2d 409, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 962 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Authority to Impose Liens.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The family court does have the authority and jurisdictional power to establish a lien against a party for the purpose of securing the performance of an award of alimony or child support. Brierly v. Brierly, 431 A.2d 410, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1177 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Bonds.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A bond may be required to ensure the return of a child whom a noncustodial parent has been allowed to remove temporarily from the state, but each case must stand on its own facts and a bond should not be required absent a showing of need therefor. McCullough v. Hudspeth, 120 R.I. 598, 389 A.2d 1242, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 706 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A trial justice should specify in his decision the factors influencing him in deciding whether or not to require a bond for the return of a child as a condition for out-of-state visitation by the noncustodial parent with the child. Absent this requirement, meaningful review of whether that decision constitutes an abuse of discretion would be impossible in most, if not all, cases. McCullough v. Hudspeth, 120 R.I. 598, 389 A.2d 1242, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 706 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Contract Actions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Superior Court, through its general equitable and legal powers, maintains the authority to adjudicate all contract actions, regardless of the marital status of the parties. Lubecki v. Ashcroft, 557 A.2d 1208, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 75 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the Family Court had subject matter jurisdiction over an agreement that was incorporated into but not merged with the parties’ divorce, such an agreement was subject to the traditional contract rule that it could not be modified except by the parties; since the former husband consented in court to modification of his obligations, he was bound. Lecours v. Lecours, 792 A.2d 730, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 48 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court justice’s powers of oversight to assure equity in property settlement agreements did not encompass a power to modify or reform an agreement not merged into the divorce decree that failed to divide one spouse’s stock bonus plan, referring only to a stock option plan; in the absence of any hint of unethical behavior (there had evidently been some sort of misunderstanding), the proper course was for the trial justice to have withdrawn approval of the agreement and then either direct the parties to renegotiate or proceed with the trial. Gorman v. Gorman, 883 A.2d 732, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 166 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A family court no longer has jurisdiction over property matters in a divorce action where an interlocutory judgment with a property distribution has been issued, the nisi period elapses, the plaintiff moves for entry of the final judgment, and then the plaintiff dies before the court takes any action. Centazzo v. Centazzo, 556 A.2d 560, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 53 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family courts have the power to award counsel fees during the pendency of an appeal or after the death of a party. Centazzo v. Centazzo, 556 A.2d 560, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 53 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court has jurisdiction to affect the rights of parties not involved with the controversy pending before the court. Rhode Island Cent. Credit Union v. Pazienza, 572 A.2d 296, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 71 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court had no jurisdiction to award custody of orphans after the probate court had appointed a temporary guardian. In re Kimberly, 583 A.2d 877, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 173 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The family court has jurisdiction to award counsel fees when appropriate in child-custody matters. In re Kimberly, 583 A.2d 877, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 173 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family Court had jurisdiction to enforce a property settlement agreement even after divorce between the parties had become final. Riffenburg v. Riffenburg, 599 A.2d 1365, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 209 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The equitable matters arising out of the family relationship that the Family Court may hear under subsection (a) are limited to those cases that originate in petitions for divorce, bed and board, and separate maintenance. Rubano v. DiCenzo, 759 A.2d 959, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 182 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Fam. Ct. R.P. Dom.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The family court, in a matter involving an information charge of assault with a dangerous weapon upon a mother by her adult son, does not have the requisite subject-matter jurisdiction to conduct a criminal trial when the defendant/son so charged is an adult. State v. Kenney, 523 A.2d 853, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 438 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though the family court had conducted a criminal trial pursuant to § 14-1-48 on a charge that an adult defendant/son assaulted his mother with a dangerous weapon, it could not retain jurisdiction over the case and proceed to sentence the defendant since the court had no subject-matter jurisdiction of the case. State v. Kenney, 523 A.2d 853, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 438 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For the Family Court to undertake a final dismissal, without notice that affords the state an opportunity to be heard, and in the absence of proper findings, is clear error. The Legislature has seen fit to vest the Family Court with exclusive jurisdiction of a limited class of felony crimes. In exercising that jurisdiction, the Family Court is obliged to comply with the state’s substantive and procedural law. State v. Strom, 941 A.2d 837, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 3 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Dismissal of Information.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice committed clear error by <i>sua sponte </i>dismissing a criminal information against defendant as defendant did not file a motion to dismiss, and the trial court failed to follow the procedural rules applicable to dismissals. By prohibiting the Attorney General from fully prosecuting the felony information in violation of R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 9.1, the trial justice clearly erred and deprived the State of a fair proceeding. State v. Strom, 941 A.2d 837, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 3 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Transfer Not Required.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The family courts do not have jurisdiction over assault upon an infant son which is a misdemeanor since district courts are given original jurisdiction over misdemeanors by § 12-3-1 and there is nothing in family court law to divest district court of such jurisdiction. State v. Zittel, 94 R.I. 235, 94 R.I. 325, 180 A.2d 455, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 78 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the child involved in a parental assault was emancipated, not subject to parental control or guardianship, and had maintained his own home and supported himself for two years, it was not error to refuse to transfer such criminal case to the family court. State v. McMahon, 110 R.I. 658, 296 A.2d 28, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 963 (1972); State v. Donato, 516 A.2d 880, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 541 (R.I. 1986).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Transfer Proper.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The superior court properly overruled defendant’s plea in abatement to an indictment charging him with assault with a dangerous weapon upon his wife and transferred the case to the family court, notwithstanding the fact that such charge required indictment or presentment by a grand jury and the family court had no grand jury. State v. Perry, 103 R.I. 6, 234 A.2d 115, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 568 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Jurisdiction of superior court was ousted and exclusive jurisdiction was vested in the family court pursuant to this section where it appeared that defendant’s victim in a charge of assault with a dangerous weapon was his wife, notwithstanding that the jurisdictional defect was not raised in the superior court at the time of sentencing. Dutton v. Langlois, 104 R.I. 528, 247 A.2d 86, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 679 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Witness Intimidation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Charge of witness intimidation in domestic assault case was properly heard in the Superior Court, as the Family Court was not vested with jurisdiction to hear and decide criminal cases of witness intimidation, but was authorized to take appropriate steps to prevent witness or victim intimidation with respect to cases over which the court had jurisdiction.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A natural mother’s desire to contact her child’s adoptive parents with the hope of seeing the child does not constitute good cause for the lifting of the confidentiality curtain which envelopes a family court adoption proceeding.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining whether good cause exists to lift the cloak of confidentiality surrounding an adoption proceeding and the extent of disclosure necessary, courts uniformly balance the following competing interests: (1) The nature of the circumstances dictating the need for release of the identity of the birth parents; (2) the circumstances and desires of the adoptive parents; and (3) the circumstances of the birth parents and their desire or at least the desire of the birth mother not to be identified; and (4) the interests of the state in maintaining a viable system of adoption by the assurance of confidentiality. In re Assalone, 512 A.2d 1383, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 531 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One seeking access to adoption information bears a heavy burden in establishing the requisite “good cause”. In re Assalone, 512 A.2d 1383, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 531 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An adopted person’s psychological need to know the identity of his biological parents may constitute good cause to permit adopted adults access to their birth records. In re Assalone, 512 A.2d 1383, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 531 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because an adoptee did not prove the existence of good cause for access to the adoption records and because deferring to the adoptee’s religious beliefs would be a preferential treatment by government, in violation of R.I. Const. art. 1, § 3 and the First Amendment of the federal Constitution, the trial court properly denied the adoptee’s petition. In re Philip S., 881 A.2d 931, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 185 (R.I. 2005).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The decision by the chief judge that good cause had not been shown for the sealing of financial records from an earlier divorce action was certainly not an abuse of discretion on his part, as the legislative judgment has been made that family court records shall be public.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where family court had jurisdiction of parties and subject matter, its power to award counsel fees could not be collaterally attacked on appeal from finding of contempt for failure to pay. Hartt v. Hartt, 121 R.I. 220, 397 A.2d 518, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1766 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Bonds.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A bond may be required to ensure the return of a child whom a noncustodial parent has been allowed to remove temporarily from the state, but each case must stand on its own facts and a bond should not be required absent a showing of need therefor. McCullough v. Hudspeth, 120 R.I. 598, 389 A.2d 1242, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 706 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Contempt.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where family court had entered interlocutory decree and awarded custody of daughter to husband, it also had authority to enter order finding husband, who traveled to Israel with daughter without notifying wife or court and without attempting to comply with decree provision to effect that parties attempt to arrange reasonable visitation rights, in deliberate contempt of decree and to enjoin and restrain husband from presenting any final decree of divorce for entry in court until he purged himself of contempt by immediately returning daughter to state and jurisdiction of court. Goldstein v. Goldstein, 109 R.I. 428, 286 A.2d 589, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 1205 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where respondent, pursuant to an interlocutory divorce decree, was responsible for the maintenance and repair payments for the jointly-owned domicile, and where respondent was in contempt of the family court for his failure to comply with the provisions of that decree, the order of the trial justice requiring respondent to pay one half of the cost of the capital improvements to the domicile was in the nature of a sanction imposed to enable respondent to purge himself of the contempt, and therefore within the sound discretion of the trial justice. Marek v. Marek, 119 R.I. 841, 383 A.2d 1031, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 621 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Detention of a juvenile nonoffender at a training school based on a family court justice’s finding of civil contempt for violating prior placement orders of the court was a violation of § 14-1-11. In re Dina N., 455 A.2d 318, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 794 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Family Court, although a statutory court, has inherent power to punish contempt of its authority. Porter v. Porter, 684 A.2d 259, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 260 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Prior finding that a confined juvenile who refused to participate in required psychiatric treatment was in civil contempt did not preclude, on double jeopardy grounds, a later prosecution for criminal contempt based on continued noncompliance; furthermore, the prosecution was not untimely, because there were repeated orders that the juvenile comply with the treatment plan, all of which were ignored. State v. Price, 820 A.2d 956, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court did not abuse its discretion in finding a mother in contempt of an earlier order awarding a father physical custody of the parties’ children because the mother sought and obtained protective orders from a Massachusetts court that directly impacted the father’s access to the children and the mother’s claims that served the basis for the protective orders were pretextual; the children’s home state was Rhode Island. Ayriyan v. Ayriyan, 994 A.2d 1207, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 60 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Criminal.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The family court has the power to initiate criminal contempt proceedings for a repeated refusal by any individual, adult or juvenile, to follow an order of the court. In re Price, 645 A.2d 488, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 229 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Motion for acquittal on charge of criminal contempt was properly denied where it was based on defendant’s argument that noncompliance with court order to cooperate in a psychiatric treatment plan occurred on the advice of counsel. State v. Price, 820 A.2d 956, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Continuance.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The family court has authority to continue a case for review once it has adjudicated the issue presented for trial, since the power to continue is inherent in the authority of a court to hear and determine the cases before it. Brandt v. Brandt, 119 R.I. 607, 381 A.2d 1047, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 591 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the family court did not finally dispose of the support issue before it, it retained jurisdiction and thus had the authority to continue the case for review within the discretion of the court, but such discretion was abused where the case was continued five times within one year even though the master found that there had been no change in defendant’s financial circumstances. Brandt v. Brandt, 119 R.I. 607, 381 A.2d 1047, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 591 (1978).</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The commission is empowered hereby to engage the services of legal, secretarial, clerical, and investigative employees and to make such other expenditures as are necessary for the effective performance of its functions.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The commission, upon receiving from any person a verified statement, not unfounded or frivolous, alleging facts indicating that a justice of the supreme court, the superior court, the family court, the district court, the workers’ compensation court, or the traffic tribunal, or a probate judge in any city or town in the state is guilty of a violation of the canons of judicial ethics, or of willful or persistent failure to perform his or her duties, disabling addiction to alcoholic beverages, drugs, or narcotics, or conduct that brings the judicial office into serious disrepute, or that such a judge has a physical or mental disability that seriously interferes and will continue to interfere with the performance of his or her duties, shall make a preliminary investigation to determine whether formal proceedings shall be instituted and a hearing held. The commission may, on its initiative, make a preliminary investigation, without receiving a verified statement, to determine whether formal proceedings shall be instituted and a public hearing held.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> If the preliminary investigation discloses that a charge of judicial unfitness of the kind mentioned in this section is supported by substantial evidence, it shall direct that a public hearing thereon be held, and the judge shall be notified of the investigation, the nature of the charge, and the time and place set for a hearing thereon. The judge shall have the right to counsel and to confront witnesses against him or her and shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present such matters in defense as he or she may choose. The notice shall be given by prepaid registered or certified mail addressed to the judge at his or her chambers or his or her last known place of residence. The judge shall file a written answer to the charges within twenty (20) days after the notice has been served upon him or her. Allegations contained in the notice that are not denied in the answer shall be deemed admitted. The notice and the answer shall be public documents. The judge shall attend the public hearing without the necessity of a subpoena being served upon him or her; and, if he or she is called as a witness by the commission at the public hearing, he or she shall take the witness stand and shall testify in the same manner as if under subpoena.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> If the preliminary investigation discloses that there exists a violation of the canons of judicial ethics and that violation is not one of a serious nature, the commission may in its discretion issue a private reprimand to the judge. The private reprimand shall caution the judge that the conduct complained of, if continued, may be the cause for discipline. The private reprimand shall include a statement of the facts found by the commission, as a result of the preliminary investigation, and may issue confidential suggestions and recommendations with respect to the judge. Any judge issued a private reprimand shall have the right to appeal the private reprimand within ten (10) days and request a hearing before the commission with the same rights accorded by this section; provided, however, that the hearing shall not be open to the public, and all evidence and proceedings relating to the private reprimand shall be kept confidential.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Upon completion of the hearings, the commission may dismiss the case on the ground of insufficiency of proof or may recommend to the supreme court the censure, suspension, immediate temporary suspension, reprimand, retirement, or removal from office of the judge under investigation; provided, however, that the recommendation for the removal of a justice of the supreme court shall be subject to the provisions of § 8-16-7(b). For the purposes of this chapter, wherever the word “judge” appears, it shall be construed to include probate judges in the cities and towns of this state.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The commission shall have the same authority to temporarily exclude all spectators from the public hearing as is possessed by justices of the superior court in criminal cases.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Effect of Judge’s Resignation.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whenever a judicial officer elects to admit to allegations or violations and to consent to the disciplinary commission’s recommended sanction, the Supreme Court’s approval of the commission’s proposed waiver of the public hearing must be obtained before any closed hearing may proceed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In re Lallo, 768 A.2d 921, 2001 R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Public hearing was properly waived upon the petition of the Commission on Judicial Tenure &amp; Discipline and the respondent, a magistrate judge, because the magistrate admitted to the allegations and agreed with the recommended sanction of public censure.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Procedures of the Rhode Island Commission on Judicial Tenure and Discipline do not result in a merger of investigatory, prosecutorial and adjudicatory functions such that judges’ rights to due process are denied.

<p class="p7"><b>Recommendations.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Included in the plenary authority to impose sanctions upon members of the bar is the authority to modify the disciplinary commission’s proposed disposition and to impose sanctions that the court deems more appropriate, including ones that are not statutorily specified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In re Lallo, 768 A.2d 921, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 83 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Though a judge violated defendant’s constitutional rights by offering him a plea bargain on condition that he not seek legal counsel, in violation of R.I. Sup. Ct. art. VI, Canons 2A, and 3B.8, public censure was not appropriate because this was an isolated incident of misconduct and the judge had an exemplary record. In re Comm'n on Judicial Tenure &amp; Discipline, 916 A.2d 746, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 26 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Termination of Pension Benefits.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The termination of the pension of an active retired justice found guilty of various unethical acts involving the use of his position for financial gain did not constitute a disproportionate remedy in violation of article I, section 8, of the Rhode Island Constitution. The judge’s actions motivated by the desire for personal gain operated to harm the public trust and confidence in the Judiciary as a whole and to affect adversely the honor and integrity of the very position he held and the capacity in which he served.

If any person fails to obey the command of any such subpoena without reasonable cause, or if a person in attendance before the commission shall, without reasonable cause, refuse to be sworn, or to be examined, or to answer a legal and pertinent question, the commission may apply to any justice of the superior court, upon proof by affidavit of the fact, for a rule or order, returnable in not less than two (2) or more than five (5) days, directing the person to show cause why he or she should not be adjudged in contempt. Upon the return of the order, the justice before whom the matter is brought for a hearing shall examine under oath the person and such person shall be given an opportunity to be heard, and if the justice shall determine that the person has refused without reasonable cause or legal excuse to be examined, or to answer a legal and pertinent question, or to produce books, accounts, papers, records, and documents material to the issue which he or she was ordered to bring or produce, he or she may forthwith commit the person to the adult correctional institutions, there to remain until he or she submits to do the act which he or she was so required to do, or is discharged according to law.

<p class="p7"><b>Balancing of Rights.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature has carefully crafted a method of investigating and adjudicating complaints against members of the judiciary, seeking to create a careful balance between the right of the public to know and the right of the judge to confidentiality.

<p class="p7"><b>Recommendations.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The commission is empowered to conduct investigations and issue findings and recommendations, but its findings and recommendations are in no way exhaustive or binding upon the Supreme Court, and therefore do not usurp the court’s inherent power.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A recommendation that a judge reimburse the state for time for which he was paid when he was not at work amounted to a civil sanction that was consistent with the disciplinary commission’s authority and did not amount to a monetary sanction that was punitive in nature or to a fine.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The governor shall immediately notify the commission of any vacancy or prospective vacancy of a justice of the Rhode Island supreme court. The commission shall advertise for each vacancy and solicit prospective candidates and shall consider names submitted from any source. Within ninety (90) days of any vacancy the commission shall publicly submit the names of not less than three (3) and not more than five (5) highly qualified persons for each vacancy to the governor. The governor shall fill any vacancy of any justice of the Rhode Island supreme court by nominating one of the three (3) to five (5) highly qualified persons forwarded to him or her by the commission for the court.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The governor shall fill any such vacancy within twenty-one (21) days of the public submission by the commission.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Each nomination shall be forwarded forthwith to the senate and to the house of representatives, and by and with the advice and consent of the senate, and by and with the separate advice and consent of the house of representatives, each nominee shall be appointed by the governor to serve subject to the general laws. The senate and the house of representatives shall, after seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the nomination, separately consider the nomination, but if either house fails within sixty (60) days after the submission to confirm the nominee, the governor shall appoint some other person to fill the vacancy and shall submit his or her appointment to the senate and to the house of representatives for confirmation in like manner until the senate and the house of representatives shall each separately confirm the nomination. If the nominee is rejected by either house, the commission shall submit a new list of three (3) to five (5) candidates to the governor for the purpose of nomination in accordance with this chapter. Any new list may include but need not be limited to the names of any candidates who were previously submitted to the governor by the commission but who were not forwarded to the senate and to the house of representatives for their advice and consent.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> During the time for consideration of the nominees by the senate and by the house of representatives, the judiciary committee of each house shall separately conduct an investigation and public hearing on the question of the qualifications of the nominee or nominees. At the public hearings, the testimony of every witness shall be taken under oath and stenographic records shall be taken and maintained.

All such subpoenas and orders shall be served as subpoenas in civil cases in the superior court are served, and witnesses so subpoenaed shall be entitled to the same fees for attendance and travel as provided for witnesses in civil cases in the superior court. If the person subpoenaed to attend before the committee fails to obey the command of the subpoena without reasonable cause, refuse to be sworn, or to be examined, or to answer a legal and pertinent question, or if any person shall refuse to produce books, accounts, papers, records, and documents material to the issue, set forth in an order duly served on him or her, the committee by majority vote of the committee members present may apply to any justice of the superior court, for any county, upon proof by affidavit of the fact, for a rule or order returnable in not less than two (2) nor more than five (5) days, directing the person to show cause before the justice who made the order or any other justice of the superior court, why he or she should not be adjudged in contempt.

<p class="p7"><b>Death of Nominee.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the case of the death or disability of a nominee, a new list is not required by this section. Assuming that the approval or disapproval of the Legislature would not have been ascertained prior to the death or disability of a nominee, the integrity of the judicial selection process would be maintained by the Governor’s selection of a different nominee from the same list that contained the deceased or disabled nominee.

<p class="p7"><b>Rejection.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In subsection (c), rejection would connote an actual vote not to confirm a nominee; in other words, a roll call vote of the House or Senate in which a majority of either chamber votes in opposition to the nominee. In such a case of rejection of the Governor’s nominee, a “new list” of three to five names must be provided to the Governor by the Judicial Nominating Commission which list may, but need not, include names from the previous list submitted by the Commission to the Governor. In re Advisory to the Governor (Judicial Nominating Comm'n), 668 A.2d 1246, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 3 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Failure to Act.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A failure to act is a de facto rejection by the Legislature, albeit one without a recorded vote. When a nominee has been rejected by such legislative inaction, the Governor’s replacement nominee must be derived from a new list of three to five names submitted to the Governor by the Judicial Nominating Commission.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Documented, legislative opposition sufficient to result in a nominee’s withdrawal presents a situation that is tantamount to rejection.

Court interpretation requires not only a full command of two (2) languages, but also a knowledge of courtroom procedure, legal vocabulary, the overall court and legal systems, and an understanding that the role of an interpreter consists not of abridging or editorializing, but of exactly interpreting every word that is spoken without emendation or amendment.</p>

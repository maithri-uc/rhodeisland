<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is an enabling act giving a person injured as a result of a crime or offense a right of action where none existed at common law. Lyons v. Scituate, 554 A.2d 1034, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 30 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section creates a new right of action in that a victim can bring an action for damages for injuries even if no criminal complaint for the crime or offense has been filed. However, it does not create a distinct cause of action for purposes of determining the appropriate statute of limitations. Lyons v. Scituate, 554 A.2d 1034, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 30 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice properly granted an insurer’s R.I. R. Civ. P. 50 motion on an insured’s claim of civil liability under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-2 for the insurer’s violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 7-15-2(b), as the insured did not establish that the insurer engaged in criminal activity. Zarrella v. Minn. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 824 A.2d 1249, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 106 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Allegations of Complaint.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Complaint to recover in civil proceeding for commission of a crime does not have to be stated with the same technical accuracy required in a criminal complaint, as long as offense is described sufficiently for identification. Williams v. Smith, 28 R.I. 531, 68 A. 306, 1907 R.I. LEXIS 73 (1907).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claims under R.I. Gen Laws § 9-1-2 were not dismissed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) because, if victims of a night club fire could have established that a town’s fire inspector was egregiously negligent in carrying out, or failing to carry out, his duties in enforcing the fire code, then it was possible that his negligence could have been found to have been gross or criminal negligence. Gray v. Derderian, 400 F. Supp. 2d 415, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28535 (D.R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not err by <i>sua sponte </i>applying a compensatory damages award to plaintiffs’ R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-2 claim as well as to their wrongful death claim, even though the complaint did not specifically seek compensatory damages. Because the defendant failed to object to the application of compensatory damages, he implicitly consented to the trial justice’s action. Tyre v. Swain, 946 A.2d 1189, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 57 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a suit brought by plaintiffs alleging a fraudulent scheme involving annuity insurance investments, the federal district court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim as to plaintiffs’ counts alleging civil liability for crimes and offenses under Rhode Island law because under the pleading standard of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8, the court found that the catchall phrase “any writing whatsoever purporting to contain evidence of any debt, contract, or promise” in R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-17-1 arguably encompassed the annuity applications, which contained evidence of a promise. W. Reserve Life Assur. Co. v. Caramadre, 847 F. Supp. 2d 329, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14327 (D.R.I. 2012), aff'd, 793 F.3d 168, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 12505 (1st Cir. 2015).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff could not show that the social hosts were liable pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-2 for supplying the plaintiff and her boyfriend with alcohol for more than a three-hour period, which resulted in the boyfriend driving into a utility pole after the boyfriend and plaintiff left the residence. The plaintiff did not show that the social hosts had the intent necessary pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-1-3 to aid and abet a criminal act. Willis v. Omar, 954 A.2d 126, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 84 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Criminal Proceedings Prerequisite.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action could not be maintained under P.S. 1882, ch. 204, § 21, if the alleged crime committed was based upon the violation of a statute which was too indefinite and uncertain to impose criminal liability upon the defendant. Maker v. Slater Mill &amp; Power Co., 15 R.I. 112, 23 A. 63, 1885 R.I. LEXIS 59 (1885).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff was entitled to maintain action under G.L. 1896, ch. 233, § 16, where defendant in criminal proceeding was fined following a plea of nolo contendere, since there was a conviction. Barker v. Almy, 20 R.I. 367, 39 A. 185, 1898 R.I. LEXIS 48 (1898).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If plaintiff entrusted money to defendant for use of another party for investment purposes, and defendant used money to speculate and lost it, the defendant was not subject to suit for recovery of money if no complaint had been made for larceny. Brady v. Messler, 27 R.I. 373, 62 A. 511, 1905 R.I. LEXIS 99 (1905).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Damages.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even assuming that an alleged violation of the former version of § 34-18-22.3 sufficiently constituted an “offense” under this section, summary judgment was properly granted on the former lessee’s claim under this section because the lessee did not allege that he had suffered any damages as a result of the nonresident landlord’s failure to designate an in-state agent for service of process during the years of the tenancy. Olsen v. DeMayo, 210 A.3d 431, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 90 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Damages for Larceny.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is remedial and not penal; therefore, an action for double damages for larceny survived the death of the plaintiff. Aylsworth v. Curtis, 19 R.I. 517, 34 A. 1109, 1896 R.I. LEXIS 33 (1896).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This statute is in derogation of the common law, and the plaintiff, in order to recover double damages for larceny, must show a conviction or admission of guilt in some criminal proceeding. Da Costa v. Rose, 70 R.I. 163, 37 A.2d 794, 1944 R.I. LEXIS 31 (1944).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature in adopting this section intended that victims of larceny be compensated generously. Ludwig v. Kowal, 419 A.2d 297, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1800 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In interpreting this statute, effectuation of the legislative intent requires that the risk of loss resulting from fluctuations in value because of inflation be placed upon the malefactor rather than upon the victim. Ludwig v. Kowal, 419 A.2d 297, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1800 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One who claims to be a victim of larceny and seeks statutory double damages may not prove guilt of larceny in the civil action except by proof of a criminal conviction or of an admission of guilt in a criminal proceeding. Ludwig v. Kowal, 419 A.2d 297, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1800 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plaintiff’s only obligation under this section was to establish defendant’s guilt of the crime of larceny by proof either of a conviction or of an admission of guilt in a prior prosecution. Ludwig v. Kowal, 419 A.2d 297, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1800 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Employer Drug Testing Statute.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Violations of the employer drug testing statute (EDTS), § 28-6.5-1, result in “injuries to the person” as contemplated by the three-year statute of limitations and, accordingly, are subject to the three-year period in § 9-1-14 rather than the 10-year period in § 9-1-13; moreover, actions under this section for civil liability for the victims of criminal offenses, which would include the misdemeanor offense created by the EDTS, are also subject to the three-year statute of limitations. Because an employee filed her action more than three years after the alleged violation of the EDTS, the claims were time-barred. Goddard v. APG Security-RI, LLC, 134 A.3d 173, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 34 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Form of Action.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action for money had and received will lie where one has obtained money from another by oppression, imposition, extortion or deceit, and the law implies the promise from such person to return it to the lawful owner. Williams v. Smith, 29 R.I. 562, 72 A. 1093, 1909 R.I. LEXIS 55 (1909).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the action brought to recover double damages for embezzlement was begun by writ of summons and declaration and alleged that the defendant as plaintiff’s bookkeeper used plaintiff’s money for her own use, the action was in trespass, rather than assumpsit, so as to warrant a body execution. Da Costa v. Rose, 71 R.I. 124, 42 A.2d 665, 1945 R.I. LEXIS 24 (1945).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court had jurisdiction over a wrongful death complaint brought under the Slayer’s Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-1.1-1(3), that sought civil liability for a criminal act under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-2; the complaint essentially sought a declaration under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-30-1 et seq., that the husband was a slayer of the decedent. Once a declaration was made, a probate court could determine what effect that declaration had on asset distribution. Tyre v. Swain, 946 A.2d 1189, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 57 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Limitations Period.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The limitation period set forth in § 9-1-14(b) for “injuries to the person” is the appropriate statute of limitations, where the nature of plaintiff ’s claim for relief under this section arises out of an alleged assault and battery for which she is entitled to relief by reason of being a person in the eyes of the law. Lyons v. Scituate, 554 A.2d 1034, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 30 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the nature of plaintiffs’ claims arose out of alleged sexual abuse by priest-defendants, damages were being sought for the sexual abuse, not for any alleged conspiracy or cover-up by hierarchy-defendants, and the limitation period set forth in § 9-1-14(b) was applicable. Kelly v. Marcantonio, 187 F.3d 192, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 18396 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the cause of action for criminial usury under § 6-26-3 and this section accrued in December 2000, and the complaint was not filed until April 2011, the borrowers’ claims were barred by the 10-year statute of limitations in § 9-1-13; the predicate conduct on which the borrowers relied in asserting their claims occurred when the lenders executed the loan documents at issue that backdated and charged the retroactive usurious interest rates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Commerce Park Realty, LLC v. HR2-A Corp., 253 A.3d 868, 2021 R.I. LEXIS 85 (R.I. 2021).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Receiver of Stolen Goods.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A fraudulent receiver who knows the goods to be stolen is guilty of larceny under G.L. 1923, ch. 397, § 13 (§ 11-41-2), hence liable for twice the value under this section. O'Brien v. Moskol, 45 R.I. 486, 123 A. 568, 1924 R.I. LEXIS 14 (1924).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Violations of Federal Law.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred by granting employer’s motion for judgment as a matter of law since the trial court assumed that R.I.G.L. § 9-1-2 is not applicable for federal crimes; there is no such limitation within the statute. Mello v. DaLomba, 798 A.2d 405, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 138 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Civil action based on violation of a federal criminal statute forbidding electronic eavesdropping without consent or a warrant required the normal quantum of proof required in a civil action, by a preponderance of the evidence, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt as required for criminal liability, and the trial court properly instructed the jury to that effect. Cady v. IMC Mortg. Co., 862 A.2d 202, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 204 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Wrongful Taking Technical Only — Damages.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the defendant towed plaintiff’s car to his garage at the request of the police, after it had been stolen and abandoned, if defendant was guilty of any wrongful taking and detention of plaintiff’s property, it was merely technical and the damage, if any, was so minimal as to call for the application of the maxim de minimus non curat lex. Manufacturers Supply Co. v. Mullins, 92 R.I. 191, 167 A.2d 755, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 19 (1961).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of the statute of frauds is to guard against perjury by one claiming under an alleged agreement. Smith v. Boyd, 553 A.2d 131, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 3 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Contracts Not to Be Performed Within a Year.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where performance was extended by parties beyond a year, and the duration was uncertain, the contract was for an indefinite term, terminable by either party at will and not against the statute of frauds. Powless v. Pawtucket Screw Co., 116 R.I. 158, 352 A.2d 643, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1259 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that an agreement is oral rather than written is not enough, standing alone, to bar its enforcement. Before an agreement may be determined to be unenforceable under this section, it must be established that the contract could not be performed within one year. In re Cable Rhode Island Sports Production, Inc., 37 B.R. 888, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 6078 (Bankr. D.R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Employment Contracts.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An oral employment contract by which it was agreed that the plaintiff would begin work as soon in the future as possible and that the duration of employment would be one year is not enforceable since the contract could not be performed within one year from the time it was made. Sutcliffe v. Atlantic Mills, 13 R.I. 480, 1882 R.I. LEXIS 23 (1882).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Contract for employment not in writing and not to be performed within one year was within the statute of frauds and unenforceable. Fuller v. Apco Mfg. Co., 51 R.I. 378, 155 A. 351, 1931 R.I. LEXIS 61 (1931).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Oral contract for one year’s service which called for plaintiff to begin work as soon as possible was unenforceable as being within the statute of frauds, since plaintiff was unable to begin his year’s work until four days after the contract was made and therefore the terms of the contract could not be performed within a one-year period from the date of the making of the contract. Kass v. Ronnie Jewelry, 118 R.I. 100, 371 A.2d 1060, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1434 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An employee-relations director’s allusion to “coming years” in a letter confirming plaintiff ’s employment with the defendant and expressing expectations of a “long and prosperous affiliation” was a sufficient writing to remove the dispute from the bar set forth in subsection (5). Payne v. K-D Mfg. Co., 520 A.2d 569, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 405 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Draft employment agreement does not satisfy the statute of frauds, where salary and other compensation provisions are left blank. Ferrera v. Carpionato Corp., 895 F.2d 818, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 1589 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Performance Possible Within Year.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A parol agreement that the defendant will not carry on a certain trade is not within the statute of frauds since by death of defendant within a year the performance of the contract would be complete. Richardson v. Pierce, 7 R.I. 330, 1862 R.I. LEXIS 34 (1862); Zanturjian v. Boornazian, 25 R.I. 151, 55 A. 199, 1903 R.I. LEXIS 34 (1903).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A parol contract which was to continue “as long as the parties are mutually satisfied” is not within the statute of frauds since it might be performed within one year. Greene v. Harris, 9 R.I. 401, 1870 R.I. LEXIS 3 (1870).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A contract to continue until the plaintiff had made a net profit of $50,000, even if it was necessary to take two years or longer to do it, did not come under the statute, since the money and not the time is the principal object and therefore, it might be performed in a year. Hodges v. Richmond Mfg. Co., 9 R.I. 482, 1870 R.I. LEXIS 11 (1870).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute of frauds does not extend to actions for payment upon contract which are wholly executed on one side within a year. Durfee v. O'Brien, 16 R.I. 213, 14 A. 857, 1888 R.I. LEXIS 33 (1888).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Part performance of an oral contract not to be performed within a year does not take such a contract out of the statute of frauds. DOUGH v. GIFFORDLINE CHEM. CO., 96 R.I. 223, 190 A.2d 480, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 74 (1963).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Contract wherein a former employer promised a commission to any employee who made a sale was not subject to the statute of frauds in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-4; because the contract contained no duration, it could possibly have been performed within one year. Gupta v. Customerlinx Corp., 385 F. Supp. 2d 157, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18782 (D.R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Pleadings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not barred from asserting statute of frauds, even though he pleaded only the general issue and did not object to plaintiff’s evidence of the contract, where plaintiff waived part of pleadings based on said contract, and where it was apparent that the defendant intended to insist upon the statute if plaintiff intended to rely on the waived pleadings. Fuller v. Apco Mfg. Co., 51 R.I. 378, 155 A. 351, 1931 R.I. LEXIS 61 (1931).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a bill alleges an agreement that is susceptible of being within the bar of the statute of frauds but does not disclose by way of allegation whether it was in writing or not, the question as to the effect of the statute thereon cannot be raised by demurrer. Politelli v. Gianfrancesco, 98 R.I. 252, 201 A.2d 129, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 157 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Tenants waived the statute-of-frauds defense where, although they stated that the lease was void ab initio, they failed to state with specificity the reasons supporting their assertion. Grant v. Briskin, 603 A.2d 324, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 36 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Sufficiency of Memorandum.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Letter which stated that three year contract of employment as a finisher was “for so much of such three years as your results show the ability that you now claim to be able to give me” was not a sufficient memorandum, since there was no definite standard without resorting to oral testimony. Wagniere v. Dunnell, 29 R.I. 580, 73 A. 309, 1909 R.I. LEXIS 60 (1909).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The written memorandum should not only be signed by the party sought to be charged but also should show the other party to the contract by name or description. Di Santis v. Cannata, 42 R.I. 118, 105 A. 561, 1919 R.I. LEXIS 9 (1919).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Defenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant may be equitably estopped from setting up the statute as a defense where to do so will prevent breach of trust, fraud and circuity of action. James R. Hodges &amp; Co. v. Howard, 5 R.I. 149 (1858).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Marriage as Consideration for Agreement.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Defenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute of frauds is no defense if the promisor fraudulently induced the marriage with no intention from the outset of performing his promise, or if the marriage is not the real end or purpose of the agreement but a mere incident or condition thereof. Hutnak v. Hutnak, 78 R.I. 231, 81 A.2d 278, 1951 R.I. LEXIS 63 (1951).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Force and Effect of Requirement.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The requirement that agreements upon consideration of marriage be in writing to be enforceable is generally given full force and effect where, despite other inducements, marriage is in whole or in part the real consideration for the agreement. Hutnak v. Hutnak, 78 R.I. 231, 81 A.2d 278, 1951 R.I. LEXIS 63 (1951).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Part Performance.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The doctrine of part performance is not applicable to contracts in consideration of marriage, but in rare instances equitable estoppel may be applied on similar facts. Hutnak v. Hutnak, 78 R.I. 231, 81 A.2d 278, 1951 R.I. LEXIS 63 (1951).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Marriage was not sufficient part performance to take oral promise out of the statute of frauds, since part performance was not exclusively referable to oral contract.

<p class="p7"><b>Origin and History of Section.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The seventh section of the statute of 29 Car. 2, cap. 3, known as the statute of frauds and perjuries, while never expressly reenacted, was recognized as a part of the law of this state, and is one of the statutes which were declared to be in force in this state by the Act of 1749. Taft v. Dimond, 16 R.I. 584, 18 A. 183, 1889 R.I. LEXIS 64 (1889).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Promise to Answer for Debt, Default or Miscarriage of Another.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The agreement of an officer of a family corporation that purchases by the corporation should be billed to him personally and that he would be responsible for their payment was that of a debtor and not that of a guarantor and was not governed by the fourth specification of this section. B. A. Buonanno, Inc. v. Pezzillo, 107 R.I. 695, 270 A.2d 912, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 827 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Agreement to Purchase Debt.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An oral promise to pay the debts of other persons in consideration that the creditor assign his claims to the promisor was not within the statute of frauds, as it was a promise to buy debts and not to pay them. Stillman v. Dresser, 22 R.I. 389, 48 A. 1, 1901 R.I. LEXIS 14 (1901).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Evidence.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>— Reliance on Promise.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The alleged promise declared on was not as a matter of law within the provisions of the statute of frauds, where defendant promised he would fix things up for the plaintiff and that if plaintiff would release an injunction against the sale of real estate, defendant would pay the plaintiff an amount due him when the property was sold.

Peacock Realty Co. v. E. Thomas Crandall Farm, 108 R.I. 593, 278 A.2d 405, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1312 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of the sixth clause of the statute of frauds is to protect the public against the unfounded claims of a specific class of persons, namely, real estate brokers and agents.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In action for commission for sale of real estate letter written by defendant was not sufficient to constitute a signed memorandum, although defendant stated it was in answer to plaintiff’s previous phone calls and letters, where the letter did not set out the terms of the contract and contained nothing to indicate that the defendant accepted the terms of the previous phone calls and letters. Kates Corp. v. Kirshenbaum, 122 R.I. 486, 409 A.2d 540, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1566 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a brokerage owner attempted to find a buyer for real estate and met with the eventual buyer, the brokerage owner was not entitled to a real estate commission for the sale of the property as the claim was barred under the statute of frauds, R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a purported contract for real estate commissions arising from the sale of certain property was not in writing, the statute of frauds, R.I.

<p class="p7"><b>— Estoppel.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To apply the doctrine of promissory estoppel to real estate brokerage agreements so as to take them out of the statute would, in the absence of fraud, defeat the very purpose for which subdivision (6) was enacted, specifically, protection against unfounded claims.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sale of a nursing home which was in the process of construction, the price for which was negotiated on a per bed basis and which required the seller to obtain all licensing necessary for its operation was essentially the sale of a business rather than the sale of real estate within subdivision (6) of this section. Bottomley v. Coffin, 121 R.I. 399, 399 A.2d 485, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1789 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defaulting purchasers of a house could not rely upon alleged unwritten assurances concerning an early move-in date to excuse their non-performance, since the statute of frauds requires all agreements involving the sale of land must be in writing to be enforceable.

<p class="p7"><b>Conspiracy.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action of the case for conspiracy will survive under the provisions of this section. Young v. Aylesworth, 35 R.I. 259, 86 A. 555, 1913 R.I. LEXIS 22 (1913).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Deceit.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action for deceit is included under the class of the trespass on the case, and so such an action against the defendant’s executrix should be allowed. Bullowa v. Gladding, 40 R.I. 147, 100 A. 249, 1917 R.I. LEXIS 17 (1917).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Injury to Vendor’s Lien.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An administrator could maintain an action against the deceased’s mortgagee who had conveyed the estate for an amount less than the sale price but who had represented to the deceased that the full price had been paid, since by such representations he prevented the deceased from claiming a purchase-money lien which was later lost when the property was conveyed to a bona fide purchaser; such a lien was personal property within the meaning of P.S. 1882, ch. 204, § 8. Reynolds v. Hennessy, 17 R.I. 169, 20 A. 307, 23 A. 639 (1890).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Judgment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since an action for trespass for damages to the person survives, the administrator of plaintiff who died after decision was entitled to enter his appearance for the plaintiff and secure a judgment. Hambly v. Hayden, 20 R.I. 558, 40 A. 417, 1898 R.I. LEXIS 109 (1898).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiffs were entitled to entry of judgment against administrator where neither decedent nor administrator had filed timely notice of intent to petition for new trial. Martin v. Hutchens, 21 R.I. 258, 43 A. 70, 1899 R.I. LEXIS 41 (1899).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Nuisances.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action on the case for building a large wooden stable so near the buildings of plaintiff as to cause a nuisance survived the death of the defendant and could be prosecuted against his executor. Aldrich v. Howard, 8 R.I. 125, 1864 R.I. LEXIS 14 (1864).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Personal Injury Actions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The action for personal injury upon which the deceased could have sued at common law, if death had not ensued, is given by a statute for survival for the benefit of his estate. Lubrano v. Atlantic Mills, 19 R.I. 129, 32 A. 205, 1895 R.I. LEXIS 53 (1895).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The words “damages to the person” mean bodily or physical injury and do not include feeling and reputation. Young v. Aylesworth, 35 R.I. 259, 86 A. 555, 1913 R.I. LEXIS 22 (1913).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Action of trespass on the case for damages including pain and suffering brought in lifetime survived death of plaintiff and could be prosecuted by executrix. Grimes v. United E. R. Co., 58 R.I. 458, 193 A. 740, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 73 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Reciprocal Rights.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The rights under this statute are reciprocal in that any action surviving for a personal representative of an estate could also be maintained against a personal representative. Bullowa v. Gladding, 40 R.I. 147, 100 A. 249, 1917 R.I. LEXIS 17 (1917).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Remedial Statutes.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action brought for larceny under a statute which was remedial and not penal survived the death of the plaintiff and could be prosecuted in the name of the plaintiff’s executors. Aylsworth v. Curtis, 19 R.I. 517, 34 A. 1109, 1896 R.I. LEXIS 33 (1896).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Third Party Beneficiary Rule.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The contention of plaintiff widow that under the third party beneficiary rule the plaintiff could bring action in her own name because she was a third party who benefited by the contract made by her joint tenant to have roof repaired was without merit since the contract to repair the roof was a personal one between decedent and defendant, of which at the time plaintiff knew nothing and as such a contract was enforceable only by the parties thereto or their legal representatives when the right of action survived. Bomes v. Rhode Island Concrete &amp; Roofing Co., 89 R.I. 311, 152 A.2d 543, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 84 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Wrongful Death Action.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action on the case for negligence to recover damages for wrongful death, brought not against the wrongdoer but after his decease against his estate, did not survive. McFadden v. Rankin, 46 R.I. 475, 129 A. 267, 1925 R.I. LEXIS 40 (1925).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By providing for survival of trespass on the case after the death of the wrongdoers, the legislature was not thereby creating a right of action in favor of one who could not have maintained it against the tortfeasor in his lifetime. Castellucci v. Castellucci, 96 R.I. 34, 188 A.2d 467, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 41 (1963).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature providing for survival of actions of trespass on the case did not in the case of minor children give them a right to maintain an action against the estate of a tortfeasor, their father, where at common law no such action could have been maintained by reason of their relationship to the tortfeasor. Castellucci v. Castellucci, 96 R.I. 34, 188 A.2d 467, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 41 (1963).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Employer Drug Testing Statute.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Violations of the employer drug testing statute (EDTS), § 28-6.5-1, result in “injuries to the person” as contemplated by the three-year statute of limitations and, accordingly, are subject to the three-year period in § 9-1-14 rather than the 10-year period in this section; moreover, actions under § 9-1-2 for civil liability for the victims of criminal offenses, which would include the misdemeanor offense created by the EDTS, are also subject to the three-year statute of limitations. Because an employee filed her action more than three years after the alleged violation of the EDTS, the claims were time-barred. Goddard v. APG Security-RI, LLC, 134 A.3d 173, 2016 R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unlike § 9-1-13(b), which is unconstitutional because it completely denies court access to product-liability claimants that were injured by a product more than ten years old, § 9-1-14(b), providing that actions for personal injuries shall be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrues, is a reasonable legislative enactment that fully complies with art. 1, sec. 5 of the R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action under Federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for misrepresentation and nondisclosure encompassing written documents and silence as well as oral statements, the controlling statute of limitations was not provided by the “words spoken” provision of this section but by § 9-1-13. Holmes v. Bateson, 434 F. Supp. 1365, 1977 U.S. Dist.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a certified question from a federal district court pursuant to R.I. Sup. Ct. art. I, R. 6, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island holds that the one-year statute of limitations of R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-17(a) of the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-1, applied to employment discrimination cases brought under the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act (RICRA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-112-1 et seq., because (1) as the FEPA and the RICRA are in pari materia with respect to employment discrimination claims, harmonization of the two statutes is best achieved by engrafting onto the RICRA the one-year statute of limitations contained in the FEPA, R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-17(a); (2) application of the three-year residual statute of limitations of R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14(b) would in effect render meaningless the one-year statute of limitations of R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-17(a) contained in the FEPA by allowing plaintiffs an end run around the limitations provision of the latter statute; and (3) FEPA reflects the Rhode Island General Assembly’s weighing of policy considerations and its legislative judgment that one year is the appropriate amount of time within which claims of employment discrimination should be brought, and the Supreme Court of Rhode Island is unable to perceive any adequate reason for not holding that the same legislative determination should be applied to RICRA, bearing in mind that it is a later-enacted statute and (significantly) is silent as to the limitations issue.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in denying the minor’s motion to amend the complaint and add a defendant, as the motion was not untimely filed; even though the underlying lawsuit had been filed by the minor’s parents, R.I.

Laws § 9-1-14(b), until such time as the impediment, the minor’s age, was removed at age 18 and, thus, the motion to amend to add a party defendant was timely filed because the minor was less than 18-years-old at the time the motion to amend was filed.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whereas the word “accrue” in § 9-1-14 leaves room for judicial interpretation and even innovation as to when the last element of a common-law cause of action comes into being, the directive in §§ 10-7-2 and 10-7-7 that suit must be brought within two years of death leaves no such room.

Rhode Island, 749 F.2d 934 (1st Cir. 1984), cert. den. 474 U.S. 921, 106 S. Ct. 252, 88 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1985).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute of limitations begins to run in a drug product-liability action not when the plaintiff discovers the personal injuries and its cause, but when plaintiff discovers or should have discovered knowledge of defendant manufacturer’s wrongful conduct.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a drug product-liability action where the manifestation of an injury, the cause of that injury, and the person’s knowledge of the wrongdoing by the manufacturer occur at different points in time, the running of the statute of limitations would begin when the person discovers, or with reasonable diligence should have discovered, the wrongful conduct of the manufacturer.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a product liability action in which the plaintiff was injured as a result of inhaling fumes from acetic acid that had spilled at her place of employment, whether she had exercised due diligence in her efforts to identify the manufacturer/supplier of the acid was irrelevant to whether the statute of limitations under this section was tolled. The statute is tolled until the plaintiff, exercising due diligence, should have discovered the wrongful conduct of the manufacturer, not the identity of the manufacturer. Renaud v. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., 662 A.2d 711, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 212 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In actions against nonperpetrator-defendants for damages resulting from childhood sexual abuse (e.g., an action against the abuser’s employer), the period of limitation under subsection (b) commences to accrue at the time the injury occurs, subject to the tolling provisions of § 9-1-19, not the time of discovery. Kelly v. Marcantonio, 678 A.2d 873, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 187 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The tort of intentional interference with a contract is not an “injury to person” and thereby is not subject to the three year statute of limitation; but, rather, is a property interest created by a contract and is thus subject to a ten-year statute of limitations. Thus, plaintiff, an attorney, could maintain a suit against defendant, another attorney, for interference with a contractual relationship. McBurney v. Roszkowski, 687 A.2d 447, 1997 R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature’s decision not to incorporate a discovery provision in subsection (b) of this section at the same time that it enacted the discovery provision in § 9-1-51 evinced an intent that claims governed by the former provision continue to be considered as accruing at the time of injury.

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature’s enactment of this section is not so “purely arbitrary” as to violate the equal protection guarantee of the R.I. Constitution under minimal scrutiny review. Dowd v. Rayner, 655 A.2d 679, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 53 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section places a reasonable limit on the parties’ right to have their claims adjudicated by the courts and does not violate the open courts provision of R.I. Const., Art. I, § 5. Dowd v. Rayner, 655 A.2d 679, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 53 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The general disability tolling statute, § 9-1-19, does not affect or supercede the provisions of this section, which contains its own provisions addressing the effects of any disabilities on limitations of actions. Bakalakis v. Woman &amp; Infants' Hosp., 619 A.2d 1105, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 29 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiffs’ claims for alleged professional negligence or other negligent wrongdoing, which were based on or related to professional services that the accountants in question allegedly performed or failed to perform, constituted actions for accounting malpractice; thus, such claims had to be brought within one of the statutory time limits specified in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.1 for filing accounting malpractice claims, and the absence of contractual privity between plaintiffs and the accountants in question did not remove such professional-negligence claims from the ambit of the accounting-malpractice statute of limitations. Bowen Court Assocs. v. Ernst &amp; Young, 818 A.2d 721, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 67 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiffs’ claims against the corporations sounded in ordinary negligence, not medical malpractice, and were governed by the statute of limitations set forth in the statute, not the one governing medical malpractice. Ho-Rath v. R.I. Hosp., 89 A.3d 806, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 51 (R.I. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in dismissing the parents’ medical malpractice claims brought on behalf of the child 12 years after the child was born with a genetic disorder, as it was outside of the three-year limitations period, although the trial court properly concluded that the child would be able to file suit on her own behalf after she attains majority. Ho-Rath v. R.I. Hosp., 115 A.3d 938, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 63 (R.I. 2015) (decision under prior law).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Discovery of Wrongful Act.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute of limitations barred plaintiffs’ claim for medical malpractice and the wrongful death of plaintiffs’ unborn child, filed eight years following the child’s death, although plaintiffs argued that they had no knowledge of wrongful conduct on defendant’s part until a newspaper article revealed that defendant’s medical license had been recently revoked as a result of malpractice in connection with the death of another infant; had plaintiffs exercised reasonable diligence at the time of their son’s death, any act of alleged negligence on defendant’s part could have been discovered. Trudeau v. Dupre, 640 A.2d 534, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 126 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plaintiff’s medical malpractice action could proceed even though filed six years after the alleged malpractice, since during the interim period the plaintiff diligently and persistently sought medical advice and subsequently filed this action within the three-year statute of limitations period following a conclusive diagnosis. Zuccolo v. Blazar, 694 A.2d 717, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 183 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a medical malpractice case, it was not error to grant a doctor’s motion for judgment as a matter of law, under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1), because the suing patient’s action was not filed until the limitations period in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.1 had expired, because it was not reasonable for the patient who experienced pain and immobility to wait almost 5 years to see another specialist, even though her workers’ compensation provider had warned her that she risked losing her workers’ compensation if she saw another specialist without its permission, and it did not provide such permission for almost five years. Hanson v. Singsen, 898 A.2d 1244, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Discovery date, for purposes of the statute of limitations, was the date that a plaintiff knew or should have known of the “wrongful act” that was the basis of a lawsuit, and exception was made for an undiscoverable act of medical negligence, as the discovery rule applied to a medical malpractice case in which an injury remained latent for years, undiscoverable by the victim, and an injury was latent and potentially undiscoverable when, exercising “reasonable diligence” at the time of the injury, a plaintiff was unable to discover the wrongful act, neglect or default, but, if a reasonable person in similar circumstances should have discovered that the wrongful conduct of the defendant caused her injuries as of some date before the plaintiff alleged that she made this discovery, then the earlier date would be used to start the running of the limitations period. Hanson v. Singsen, 898 A.2d 1244, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a medical malpractice case in which a patient and his wife appealed a district court’s entry of summary judgment in favor of various doctors and others, their claim was time-barred by the three-year statute of limitations in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.1(2) [now § 9-1-14.1(3)]. The statute of limitations started when they were informed that the results of magnetic resonance imaging revealed a previously undiagnosed mass as a cervical tumor, not when, after the patient’s surgery, the cancerous nature of the tumor was discovered. Bustamante v. Oshiro, 64 A.3d 1200, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 77 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court could not have determined whether, as a matter of law, reasonable diligence should have uncovered potential wrongdoing by the drug manufacturer prior to October 23, 2006, because it would not have been unreasonable to conclude that as of October 23, 2006, the decedent did not yet have cause to believe she might have had a cause of action against the manufacturer, and the undisputed facts did not show that, while the decedent was aware of an injury due to the drug, she was not in fact conducting reasonable diligence at this time by consulting a series of doctors. Esposito v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 130 F. Supp. 3d 622, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124958 (D.R.I. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Insurance malpractice case filed in August 2009 was barred by the three-year statute of limitations because the issue of possible malpractice concerning the lack of UM coverage arose in late 2002, when plaintiff insured received the first coverage update, which he failed to read; the insured also received notice of a renewed policy in February 2006 that he failed to read and other coverage updates. The insured failed to exercise the necessary reasonable diligence when he failed to at least peruse the summary pages of the coverage update, and the large reduction in the premium amount should have alerted him to read the declarations page or contact his agent. Faber v. McVay, 155 A.3d 153, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 31 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a client’s breach of contract with fraud claim against an attorney, which centered on the attorney’s attempt to obtain a mortgage modification on behalf of the client, was a legal malpractice claim that arose from a professional relationship, the claim was barred by the three-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice claims. The discovery rule did not save the action because the statute of limitations began to run on the foreclosure date as the client admitted that on that date the client knew that the attorney committed negligence. Broccoli v. Manning, 208 A.3d 1146, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 42 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Minors.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the case of minors on whose behalf suit has not been brought within three years of the alleged malpractice, this section permits such individuals up to three years after reaching the age of majority to initiate a suit, but in those cases in which actions have been initiated on behalf of minors, plaintiffs are required to join all potential defendants within three years of the alleged malpractice or be time-barred against those defendants not so joined. Dowd v. Rayner, 655 A.2d 679, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 53 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (a) does not allow a minor to amend a pending complaint to include new defendants more than three years after occurrence of the incident that gave rise to the cause of action. Bakalakis v. Woman &amp; Infants' Hosp., 619 A.2d 1105, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 29 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Negligent Sterilization.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Negligent performance of a sterilization procedure which results in the birth of a child is a tort for which recovery may be allowed. Emerson v. Magendantz, 689 A.2d 409, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 69 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action for negligent sterilization resulting in the birth of a child, plaintiffs would be entitled to recover the medical expenses of the ineffective sterilization procedure, the medical and hospital costs of the pregnancy, the expense of a subsequent sterilization procedure, loss of wages, loss of consortium to the spouse arising out of the unwanted pregnancy, and medical expenses for prenatal care, delivery, and postnatal care. However, no recovery would be allowed for emotional distress arising out of the birth of a healthy child. Emerson v. Magendantz, 689 A.2d 409, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 69 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Pleadings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff’s contention that her complaint was improperly dismissed because neither R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 8(a) nor R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.1(2) [now § 9-1-14.1(3)] required her to plead the discovery rule in her complaint was without merit. Since the complaint disclosed on its face that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations, the statute of limitations defense could be raised on a R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss and plaintiff was required to plead the discovery rule. Barrette v. Yakavonis, 966 A.2d 1231, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 31 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fact that R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.1 did not expressly require a party to allege in the complaint that he or she was invoking the discovery rule was of no consequence; the time that the negligence allegedly occurred was a material allegation in the complaint that was subject to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) scrutiny. Barrette v. Yakavonis, 966 A.2d 1231, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 31 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Relation to Mootness Doctrine.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State’s appeal of a judgment denying declaratory relief relating to insurance coverage was moot because the underlying case, which involved a medical malpractice claim, had been resolved in favor of defendants; because a three year statute of limitations applied to medical malpractice actions, it was highly unlikely that any more claims relating to the policies at issue would arise, and, therefore, this case did not fall within the limited exception to the mootness doctrine which allowed review of matters of extreme public importance, which were capable of repetition but which evaded review. State v. Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Ass'n, 941 A.2d 219, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 17 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Standards for Seeking Defendants Subject to Liability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The reasonable-diligence standard of this section is applicable to the efforts of a plaintiff who seeks to determine potential defendants in a malpractice dispute. It is necessary for a plaintiff to investigate diligently who may or may not have had any exposure to liability during treatment. Dionne v. Baute, 589 A.2d 833, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 63 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Tolling Provision.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The tolling provision statute, subsection (b) of this section, which assists a plaintiff who is unable in the exercise of reasonable diligence to discover an injury due to medical malpractice, did not apply since the injury was known to the plaintiff, who merely claimed that she did not know the identity of the medicial doctor who might have treated her late husband. Grossi v. Miriam Hosp., 689 A.2d 403, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 49 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Undiscovered act of negligence was not necessarily an undiscoverable act of negligence for the purposes of tolling the statute of limitations. Hanson v. Singsen, 898 A.2d 1244, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Tolling provision did not apply to a patient’s medical malpractice suit with regard to her adding an emergency room doctor to the suit four years after the commencement of the action. Therefore, the patient’s suit was properly dismissed as against that doctor. Foley v. St. Joseph Health Servs., 899 A.2d 1271, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 109 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the tolling provision of R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.1 remained in existence for the benefit of the child and the parents’ loss of consortium claim was derivative of the child’s malpractice claim, the parents were permitted to avail themselves of the benefit of the statutory tolling period. Ho-Rath v. R.I. Hosp., 115 A.3d 938, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 63 (R.I. 2015) (decision under prior law).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Accrual of Cause of Action.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action under this section, based on the failure of counsel in examining the title to certain real estate to disclose the existence of a state tax lien on the property, accrued when the clients became aware of the existence of the lien, although they did not make a payment in order to discharge the lien until almost two years later. Bigden v. Cuculo, 658 A.2d 911, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 169 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plaintiff’s malpractice action was time barred and did not fall within the exception created by subsection (b), since the plaintiffs admitted that the alleged acts of negligence occurred, at the latest, more than three years ago, that they had retained outside counsel during the trial in which the negligence allegedly occurred, and that they were present in the courtroom when the trial judge admonished the attorney for his “egregious trial preparation”.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As an attorney’s alleged malpractice in setting up a trust so as to deny his client access to trust principal was discoverable by the client in the exercise of reasonable diligence when the trust was executed, her claim that she did not discover the error until years later was unavailing, and her claim was properly dismissed as time-barred under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.3. Sharkey v. Prescott, 19 A.3d 62, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 59 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly determined claims by a decedent’s heirs against a law firm for legal malpractice were time-barred by the three-year limitation period set forth in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.3 because the heirs filed the complaint in 2009 and all the facts used to support their allegations of legal malpractice allegedly occurred between February 3, 1976, and May 1987; the discovery rule exception, § 9-1-14.3(2), did not toll the limitations period because the heirs were aware of each act listed in the complaint on or before 1987. Mendes v. Factor, 41 A.3d 994, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 51 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Client’s legal malpractice claims were barred by the three-year statute of limitations because the client retained an attorney sometime in November 2007, and the attorney represented the client until he withdrew in June 2009, but the client did not file her complaint until April 13, 2012. Behroozi v. Kirshenbaum, 128 A.3d 869, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 2 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in concluding that the discovery rule did not toll the statute of limitations because a client was clearly aware of facts that would lead her to believe she had a potential malpractice claim; the client continuously questioned the attorney about the adequacy of his representation. Behroozi v. Kirshenbaum, 128 A.3d 869, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 2 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a client’s legal malpractice claims were barred by the three-year statute of limitations, the client’s claim for fraud was also barred by the three-year statute of limitations because the fraud the client alleged arose from her professional relationship with an attorney. Behroozi v. Kirshenbaum, 128 A.3d 869, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 2 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Reasonable Diligence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The general rule requires legal malpractice actions to be brought within three years of the acts or omissions constituting the alleged legal malpractice; however, subsection (b) of this section provides an exception if the legal malpractice could not be discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time of its occurrence. Thus, a client who sought to recover against an attorney hired to collect on a money judgment should, by exercising reasonable diligence, have had notice shortly after hiring another attorney that his interest in the judgment property was clearly a voidable preference; therefore, the subsequent malpractice action was barred by the three-year statute of limitations. Penn-Dutch Kitchens v. Grady, 651 A.2d 731, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 299 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the plaintiff had exercised reasonable diligence instead of waiting several months to begin his quest for copies of the pertinent instructions, the plaintiff could have discovered any alleged infirmities in the requested jury instructions, as well as the final jury instructions, well before his receipt of the judge’s instructions. As a result, subsection (b) did not act to extend the commencement date of the three-year statute of limitations. Therefore, the operative date for the purposes of commencing the statute of limitations occurred no later than when the jury returned its verdict at the conclusion of the trial. Guay v. Dolan, 685 A.2d 269, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 267 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As soon as plaintiffs learned that a deed conveying the property had been recorded, they believed they were wronged because they had not consented to or authorized the sale, and thus they were required to determine what claims they had against the parties involved; plaintiffs could not avoid the three-year statute of limitations or seek application of the discovery-rule exception under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.3(2) by faulting their bankruptcy attorneys, and plaintiffs wholly failed to satisfy the reasonable diligence standard of the statute. Fogarty v. Palumbo, 163 A.3d 526, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 96 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Tolling.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plaintiff filed suit in federal district court on a date beyond the three-year statutory period. Since the complaint filed in federal district court was itself time barred, its filing could not toll the statute of limitations. Guay v. Dolan, 685 A.2d 269, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 267 (R.I. 1996).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The general disability tolling statute, this section, does not affect or supercede the provisions of § 9-1-14.1, which contains its own provisions addressing the effects of any disabilities on limitations of actions. Bakalakis v. Woman &amp; Infants' Hosp., 619 A.2d 1105, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 29 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in denying the minor’s motion to amend the complaint and add a defendant, as the motion was not untimely filed; even though the underlying lawsuit had been filed by the minor’s parents, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-19 tolled the statute of limitations on personal injury actions, found at R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14(b), until such time as the impediment, the minor’s age, was removed at age 18 and, thus, the motion to amend to add a party defendant was timely filed because the minor was less than 18-years-old at the time the motion to amend was filed. Rachal v. O'Neil, 925 A.2d 920, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 76 (R.I. 2007).</p>

Bliven v. Wheeler, 23 R.I. 379, 50 A. 644, 1901 R.I. LEXIS 151 (1901).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A child’s minority tolls the statute of limitations in actions brought against the state. Bishop v. Jaworski, 524 A.2d 1102, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 467 (R.I. 1987).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the tolling provision of R.I. Gen.

Ho-Rath v. R.I. Hosp., 115 A.3d 938, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 63 (R.I. 2015) (decision under prior law).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Unsound Mind.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The “unsound mind” tolling provision in this section refers to a mental condition that renders a person incompetent or incapable of managing his or her everyday affairs and does not encompass more limited impairments such as a selective inability to recall particular facts or a reluctance to seek legal redress based upon those facts. Smith v. O'Connell, 997 F. Supp. 226, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3456 (D.R.I. 1998), aff'd sub nom. Kelly v. Marcantonio, 187 F.3d 192, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 18396 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A conclusion that “unsound mind” refers to a condition that renders a plaintiff incapable of managing his everyday affairs is consistent with judicial interpretations of the term in other contexts and with the rule of statutory construction that exceptions in statutes of limitations in favor of disabled persons are strictly construed. Kelly v. Marcantonio, 187 F.3d 192, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 18396 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To establish the disability of unsound mind, for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations, a party must demonstrate an inability to manage one’s day-to-day affairs. Roe v. Gelineau, 794 A.2d 476, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 66 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While repressed recollection could establish the disability of unsound mind, for purposes of tolling a statute of limitations, an alleged sexual abuse victim did not present sufficient evidence to require a hearing on whether his alleged repressed recollection constituted an unsound mind. Roe v. Gelineau, 794 A.2d 476, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 66 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The 90-day provision in R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-24.1 fell under an exception to the tolling provision in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-19. Johnson v. Newport County Chapter for Retarded Citizens, Inc., 799 A.2d 289, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 167 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a husband did not file a defamation and malicious prosecution suit for seven years after the husband was arrested for disorderly conduct based on allegations made by the acquaintances, and where the husband did not show that he was of unsound mind when the action accrued in accordance with R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-19, the statutes of limitations in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14 were not tolled and the acquaintances were entitled to summary judgment. Austin v. Carden, 818 A.2d 662, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 51 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiffs’ sexual assault and conspiracy suit against a church and officials was barred by the three-year statute of limitations in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14(b) because: (1) they filed suit more than 10 years after the statutory period had run; and (2) the statute was not tolled since, inter alia, plaintiffs did not contend that the applicable statute of limitations should be tolled by virtue of the “unsound mind” disability provision. Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop, 941 A.2d 174, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 12 (R.I.), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 955, 129 S. Ct. 422, 172 L. Ed. 2d 305, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 7508 (2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a deceased employee’s widow and the employee’s estate sued the employee’s former employer for breach of contracts to provide health and life insurance and pension benefits, the claims were time-barred because (1) the claims were not filed within ten years of the employer’s answer to plaintiffs’ counsel’s latest letter, and (2) the husband’s “unsound mind” did not toll this time, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-19, as the husband’s inability to manage the husband’s daily affairs during the relevant period was not shown. Estate of Frusher v. Abt Assocs., 643 F. Supp. 2d 220, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73233 (D.R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Repressed Memory.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The inability to recall incidents of sexual abuse may constitute a disability that extends the time within which claims for resulting injury may be brought. The trial court, after hearing and considering expert medical and scientific evidence and opinion, must decide in the first instance, as a matter of law, whether the alleged repressed recollection in a particular case is sufficiently relevant, reliable, and scientifically and/or medically established so as to constitute “unsound mind,” thereby tolling the action limitation period. Kelly v. Marcantonio, 678 A.2d 873, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 187 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A temporary inability to remember alleged acts of sexual abuse, failure to recognize those acts as tortious, or a difficulty in overcoming a reluctance to “re-live” the matter by initiating legal action did not constitute a condition of “unsound mind” that tolled the period of limitations. Smith v. O'Connell, 997 F. Supp. 226, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3456 (D.R.I. 1998), aff'd sub nom. Kelly v. Marcantonio, 187 F.3d 192, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 18396 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In enacting § 9-1-51 the legislature distinguished unsound mind from repressed recollection. Kelly v. Marcantonio, 187 F.3d 192, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 18396 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To the extent that prior case law left open the option that repressed recollection, standing alone, could toll the statute of limitations with respect to nonperpetrator defendants, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island now forecloses it and holds that, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-19, repressed recollection, in and of itself, is not a viable tolling mechanism against nonperpetrator defendants in childhood sexual abuse cases. In the Supreme Court’s opinion, reading R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 9-1-19 and 9-1-51 together makes it clear that § 9-1-51 sets forth the exclusive means by which the statute of limitations can be tolled based on the repressed recollection of childhood sexual abuse. Hyde v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 139 A.3d 452, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 85 (R.I. 2016).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant priest’s statements to plaintiffs at the time of abuse that his advances were part of their religious training in sexuality did not amount to fraudulent concealment of causes of action against him, since plaintiffs’ alleged reliance on those statements after they became adults would have been unreasonable as a matter of law.

The savings statute, § 9-1-22, was applicable since the insurer and the insured in this case shared a sufficient commonality of interest to consider them sufficiently linked under the savings statute; and the insurer was aware of the lawsuit, as it had dispatched lawyers to ask the court to dismiss the first action on grounds of inadequate service of process on its insured.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Judgment for a bank was proper in a borrower’s claim of privacy violation under R.I. Gen.

The buyer of the property at a foreclosure sale, although not personally liable for the balance of the loan to the bank, risked losing title to the property had the loan not been paid, and the bank had a legal interest in the property dating to 1978, when the borrower and her then-husband undertook the mortgage.

<p class="p7"><b>Assignment of Claim.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An insured may assign its bad-faith claim against its insurer to the injured claimant for the limited purpose of recovering the difference between the judgment received against the insured and the insurance-policy limits. Mello v. General Ins. Co., 525 A.2d 1304, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 496 (R.I. 1987), limited, Imperial Cas. &amp; Indem. Co. v. Bellini, 947 A.2d 886, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 66 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Bad Faith Delay.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where insured alleged that the approximately 15-month lapse of time between the date when the fire occurred and the date the claim was finally settled constituted a bad-faith refusal to pay the insured’s claim, the insured failed to meet his burden of proof since the fact of a seven-month delay in receipt of the fire marshal’s final report by the insurance company was insufficient in light of the agreed statement that the report was not available to the insurance company until over 14 months after the fire. Bitgood v. Allstate Ins. Co., 481 A.2d 1001, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 600 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Breach of Contractual Duty.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There can be no cause of action for an insurer’s bad-faith refusal to pay a claim until the insured first establishes that the insurer breached its duty under the contract of insurance.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Before a bad-faith claim can even be considered, a plaintiff must prove that the insurer breached its obligation under the insurance contract. Lewis v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 742 A.2d 1207, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 3 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Both an objective and a subjective component are required to show bad faith: (1) The absence of an objectively reasonable basis to deny, and (2) the insurer’s subjective knowledge or its reckless disregard of the absence of such basis. Pace v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 838 F.2d 572, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 1211 (1st Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Summary judgment against the plaintiff was appropriate where the plaintiff failed to carry his initial burden of proof in a bad-faith claim by not even providing a copy of the insurance policy, his initial request for arbitration did not rise to the level of a demand, an issue existed about the extent of the injuries, and the insurance company paid the award upon completion of arbitration. Lewis v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 742 A.2d 1207, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 3 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An insurer may avoid liability by bringing a declaratory judgment action in order to clarify coverage terms without the action necessarily being viewed as a bad-faith maneuver. Where an insured provided no evidence that the insurer was doing more than attempting to clarify its coverage, the insured did not meet his burden in opposing the insurer’s summary judgment motion on a bad-faith count. LaBonte v. Nat'l Grange Mut. Ins. Co., 810 A.2d 250, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 225 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Coverage Issues.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The “Broad Form Comprehensive General Liability” policy in this case did not provide coverage against a complaint of intentional racial discrimination brought pursuant to Chapter 5 of Title 28, and the insurer had no duty to defend and indemnify from such a claim. Foxon Packaging Corp. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., 905 F. Supp. 1139, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17743 (D.R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Estoppel.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An insurer is estopped from rescinding a policy due to a material misrepresentation if the insurer or its agent knew the application contained the misstatement. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co. v. Fish, 910 F. Supp. 58, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 229 (D.R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A federal district court was not precluded from directing a verdict for the insurer, where federal standards governed whether the evidence merited jury consideration, and the court found no evidence that the insurer had acted in bad faith. Cowdell v. Cambridge Mut. Ins. Co., 808 F.2d 160, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 35099 (1st Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The existence of an arguable question of fact regarding coverage, in addition to the provision of a defense, albeit scant, and the eventual contribution to the settlement of a third-party claim, precluded a finding of bad faith on the part of the insurer. Rumford Property &amp; Liab. Ins. Co. v. Carbone, 590 A.2d 398, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 75 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Fairly Debatable Claim.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a claim is “fairly debatable,” the insurer is entitled to debate it, whether the debate concerns a matter of fact or law. The mere fact a court or jury ultimately rejects the insurer’s reason for denial does not demonstrate a breach of the insurer’s duty to exercise good faith. Pace v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 838 F.2d 572, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 1211 (1st Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a vessel owner’s claim under a maritime hull policy was “fairly debatable,” presenting an objectively reasonable basis to deny coverage, no liability in tort could arise against the insurer. Pace v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 838 F.2d 572, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 1211 (1st Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-33 provides that the question of whether or not an insurer has acted in bad faith in refusing to settle a claim shall be a question to be determined by the trier of fact; that is, bad faith is established when the proof demonstrates that the insurer acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law. Further, a plaintiff need not establish entitlement to a judgment as a matter of law on a breach of contract claim in order to establish bad faith. Skaling v. Aetna Ins. Co., 799 A.2d 997, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Regarding whether pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-33 a realty corporation could assign its bad faith claim against the insurance company to the purported assignee, who was hurt when a step on the realty company’s property collapsed injuring the purported assignee, no bad faith showing was in fact made since the insurance company’s liability to the realty company was “fairly debatable” since it was not clear that the realty company was an insured under the relevant insurance policy. Imperial Cas. &amp; Indem. Co. v. Bellini, 947 A.2d 886, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 66 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Federal Preemption.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C.S. § 1001 et seq., preempts Rhode Island’s bad faith insurance statute. Morris v. Highmark Life Ins. Co., 255 F. Supp. 2d 16, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5851 (D.R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Liability Release Upheld.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Release absolving defendants “of and from any and all actions, causes of action, claims, demands, damages, costs, expenses, compensatory, incidental, consequential and/or punitive damages, or any other thing whatsoever on the account of or in any way growing out of the underlying claim” clearly releases the defendants from any bad-faith claim. Collins v. Fairways Condominiums Ass'n, 592 A.2d 147, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 120 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Settlement Offers.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An insurance company’s fiduciary obligations include not only the duty to act in good faith, but also a duty to act in the best interests of the insured, and the company therefore must consider seriously a plaintiff’s reasonable offer to settle within the policy limits. Asermely v. Allstate Ins. Co., 728 A.2d 461, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 101 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If an insurer declines to settle a case within the policy limits, it does so at its peril in the event that a trial results in a judgment that exceeds the policy limits, including interest, for such a judgment will render the insurer liable for the amount that exceeds the policy limits, unless it can show that the insured was unwilling to accept the offer of settlement.

<p class="p7"><b>Accrual of Actions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A cause of action for loss of consortium arising from a spouse’s injury begins to run at the time that the injury occurred to the injured spouse. Soares v. Ann &amp; Hope of R.I., Inc., 637 A.2d 339, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. 1994), overruled in part, Berman v. Sitrin, 101 A.3d 1251, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 137 (R.I. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Causation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A directed verdict against minor plaintiffs on their loss-of-society claims was proper based on a finding that the children were separated from their mother as the result of divorce, not because of injuries received by the mother in an automobile accident. Shayer v. Bohan, 708 A.2d 158, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 39 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Derivative Cause of Action Under Section.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action for loss of consortium under this section, although a separate cause of action, is not an independent action but a derivative one that is attached to the claim of the injured spouse. It arises from the injured spouse’s physical injury and is dependent upon the success of the underlying tort claim. Sama v. Cardi Corp., 569 A.2d 432, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 22 (R.I. 1990); Hodor v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n, 637 A.2d 357, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 45 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the plaintiff ’s husband received workers’ compensation benefits under the Workers’ Compensation Act and was therefore barred from pursuing a tort action for physical injuries against his employer, the plaintiff is similarly barred from recovering for loss of consortium resulting from those injuries. Sama v. Cardi Corp., 569 A.2d 432, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 22 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unless a spouse or child of an impaired party (the “deprived parties”) can show that joinder of their derivative claims for loss of consortium, society, and companionship with those of the impaired party was not feasible before the impaired party settled, arbitrated, or litigated his or her claims, the deprived parties must join their claims with those of the impaired party before an arbitration award or judgment adjudicating the impaired party’s claims has become final, whichever event first occurs. Desjarlais v. USAA Ins. Co., 824 A.2d 1272, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 150 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Rhode Island Supreme Court has held that an action for loss of consortium under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-41 is a derivative claim that is attached to the claims of an injured spouse or parent. Such action arises from the injured spouse or parent’s physical injury and is dependent upon the success of the underlying tort claim. Therefore, if a husband or father has no right to recover against a defendant, it follows that a plaintiff wife or child has no such right either. Forest v. Pawtucket Police Dep't, 290 F. Supp. 2d 215, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18838 (D.R.I. 2003), aff'd, 377 F.3d 52, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 15527 (1st Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action that a patron and his wife brought against a tavern owner to recover for injuries resulting from the patron’s fall down stairs at the tavern, summary judgment on the spouse’s claim for loss of consortium was inappropriate because there were genuine factual disputes with respect to the patron’s claims against the tavern owner and the spouse’s claims were derivative in nature. Noonan v. New Wharf Tavern, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 318 (D.R.I. Jan. 3, 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because plaintiff’s wife was not a party to his lawsuit, there was no evidence of any successful tort action by her against defendant, and plaintiff’s underlying abuse of process claim failed, his claim for loss of consortium under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-41 was bootless, there having been nothing upon which such a derivative claim could have been based. Fiorenzano v. Lima, 982 A.2d 585, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 121 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Establishment of Paternity.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A claim for loss of companionship could not be sustained where, in spite of the claimant’s paternity contentions and the apparent willingness of the trial justice to entertain the claim, the record was bare of facts showing that the claimant first took the requisite statutory steps in an appropriate forum to establish his paternity. McKinnis v. Women &amp; Infants Hosp., 749 A.2d 574, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 91 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Expired Claim Not Relating Back.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The assertion of one spouse’s right to a personal injury claim within the statutory period of limitations will not allow for the introduction of the other spouse’s expired loss of consortium claim through an amended complaint; such a claim, in effect, does not relate back to the original, timely filed complaint. Normandin v. Levine, 621 A.2d 713, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 70 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a motion to amend was filed more than three years after the cause of action for loss of consortium accrued, the claim was barred by the limitations period in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-41 and R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-114. Balletta v. McHale, 823 A.2d 292, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 135 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Parent’s Claim Dismissed.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiffs did not establish by sufficient evidence in the record that they suffered a loss of son’s society and companionship as a result of a tortious injury to him, and trial court correctly dismissed both parents’ claims for loss of consortium. Jameson v. Hawthorne, 635 A.2d 1167, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 1 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Physical Injury Not Required.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Loss of consortium and loss of society claims arise because an injured spouse, parent or child, due to a tortious injury, can no longer supply the affection, companionship and society natural to such a relationship. Therefore, there is no requirement that the spouse, child or parent suffering the loss must also have some physical injuries as a result thereof. Fritz v. May Dep't Stores Co., 866 F. Supp. 66, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15033 (D.R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Prospective Application.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A wife was not entitled to recover damages, as a matter of law, for the loss of sentimental consortium due to injuries sustained by her husband as a result of a motor-vehicle accident occurring prior to the effective date of this section. Amaral v. Cabral, 494 A.2d 94, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 536 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Recovery by Uninjured Wife.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Wife could recover, under the uninsured motorist clause of an insurance policy issued to her and her husband, for loss of consortium under the policy even though she did not sustain a bodily injury. Ferreira v. Travelers Ins. Co., 684 F. Supp. 1150, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4224 (D.R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Recovery Under Insurance Policy.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A minor’s claim for loss of consortium benefits under the uninsured-motorist provisions of an automobile-liability policy was barred, where the policy required that the person from whom the consortium loss was derived must also be an insured under the policy and the deceased father from whom the claim was derived was not insured. Terilli v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 641 A.2d 1321, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 166 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a wife failed to show that joinder of her derivative loss of consortium claim and loss of society claims of her minor children was not feasible before the injured husband settled his underlying tort claims and arbitrated his underinsured motorist (UIM) claims, the superior court properly dismissed her suit against the UIM insurer on summary judgment. Desjarlais v. USAA Ins. Co., 824 A.2d 1272, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 150 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Tolling.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiffs’ assertions that because a jury found in their favor on a breach of contract claim, they were entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-45 was meritless for the simple fact that because the issue was allowed to go to a jury, did not make it inherently “justiciable.” Chrabaszcz v. Johnston Sch. Comm., 474 F. Supp. 2d 298, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12822 (D.R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a contractor’s breach of contract action against a project owner, the court entered judgment in favor of the contractor because it sufficiently supported its breach of contract claim and awarded the contractor prejudgment interest under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-21-10 on the compensatory damages award. The court declined to award either party attorney’s fees and costs under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-45 because neither party was willing to concede that one or more of its significant claims lacked legal and/or evidentiary support, which resulted in considerable motion practice and a lengthy and, no doubt, costly trial. Allstate Interiors &amp; Exteriors, Inc. v. Stonestreet Constr., LLC, 907 F. Supp. 2d 216, 2012 U.S. Dist.

Furtado v. Goncalves, 63 A.3d 533, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 53 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>District court did not err in awarding attorneys’ fees to defendant because the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that plaintiffs’ allegations were clearly frivolous, and the district court did not err in not providing a fuller explanation because, even on appeal, plaintiffs pointed to nothing in the record that supported their assertion that their claim had merit. Universal Truck &amp; Equip. Co. v. Southworth-Milton, Inc., 765 F.3d 103, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 16915 (1st Cir. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in denying a seller attorney’s fees because it found that a termite problem and damage to the door of the property the seller sold to the purchasers presented justiciable issues, even though the purchasers’ arguments were meritless.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a dispute over a bequest to a former wife in a decedent’s will, the wife was not entitled to attorney’s fees because (1) the case was not based on a breach of contract, and (2) a justiciable issue on the testator’s testamentary intent existed. Glassie v. Doucette, 159 A.3d 88, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 54 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was error to award a tenant attorneys’ fees under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-45 because (1) the statute only granted a court authority to award attorneys’ fees to a party prevailing on a breach of contract claim, and, (2) while the tenant alleged such a claim, the tenant did not pursue the claim at trial, the jury was not instructed on the claim, and the tenant only prevailed on the tenant’s conversion claim. Heneault v. Lantini, 213 A.3d 410, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 110 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Federal Subject Matter Threshold Requirements.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unless a court can, on the basis of the pleadings, find the complaint or the opposition thereto completely meritless, a requested award for attorney’s fees must be added to the amount sought for breach of contract in order to satisfy the amount in controversy requirements in deciding whether federal subject matter jurisdiction should be retained. Billings &amp; Co., Inc. v. Pine Street Realty Assoc. Ltd. Partnership, 754 F. Supp. 10, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17798 (D.R.I. 1990).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not abuse the justice’s discretion in denying property owners an award of attorney’s fees when the owners prevailed in an action brought by neighboring property owners claiming easement rights pursuant to a consent agreement; the trial justice found that, even though the neighboring property owners did not prevail, there was a justiciable issue.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To the extent that prior case law left open the option that repressed recollection, standing alone, could toll the statute of limitations with respect to nonperpetrator defendants, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island now forecloses it and holds that, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-19, repressed recollection, in and of itself, is not a viable tolling mechanism against nonperpetrator defendants in childhood sexual abuse cases. In the Supreme Court’s opinion, reading R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 9-1-19 and 9-1-51 together makes it clear that § 9-1-51 sets forth the exclusive means by which the statute of limitations can be tolled based on the repressed recollection of childhood sexual abuse.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens, </i>when an alternative forum has jurisdiction to hear a case, and when trial in the chosen forum would establish oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant out of all proportion to plaintiff’s convenience, or when the chosen forum is inappropriate because of considerations affecting the court’s own administrative and legal problems, the court may, in the exercise of its sound discretion, dismiss the case on <i>forum non conveniens </i>grounds, even if jurisdiction and proper venue are established.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The <i>forum non conveniens </i>inquiry consists of a two-prong analysis. First, the court must decide whether an alternative forum exists that is both available and adequate to resolve the disputed legal issues. Second, the court must determine the inconvenience of continuing in the plaintiff’s chosen forum by weighing private- and public-interest factors. The defendant carries the burden of persuasion at each stage of the <i>forum non conveniens</i>. Kedy v. A.W. Chesterton Co., 946 A.2d 1171, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 68 (R.I. 2008).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Lis pendens is not a lien but merely puts all prospective purchasers on notice that there is a suit pending involving an issue of title to certain real property, and therefore due process of law does not mandate notice and an opportunity to be heard before the filing of a notice of lis pendens under this section. George v. Oakhurst Realty, 414 A.2d 471, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1557 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is not unconstitutional as a violation of the due process clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions since there is no significant taking of property and the extent of the state’s involvement in the filing of a notice of lis pendens is minimal. Darr v. Muratore, 143 B.R. 973, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12794 (D.R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even if the filing of a notice of lis pendens constituted a taking with sufficient state involvement, the Rhode Island lis pendens procedure provides adequate constitutional safeguards since this section specifies that a plaintiff shall give notice to all named parties within seven days after recording a notice of lis pendens, and a defendant may subsequently file a motion to quash an improperly filed lis pendens; there is no constitutional requirement that the landowner be given a hearing before the notice of lis pendens is filed. Darr v. Muratore, 143 B.R. 973, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12794 (D.R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Action Not Concerning Title.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A notice filed by plaintiff which stated that in event of a favorable decree on a bill for accounting a levy would be made on certain real estate belonging to defendants was null and void since bill did not concern the title to real estate. Campbell v. Metcalf, 20 R.I. 352, 39 A. 190, 1898 R.I. LEXIS 53 (1898).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plaintiff’s act of filing a lis pendens was done maliciously since it was filed as a calculated attempt to coerce the defendant into paying her the money she believed past due and owing to her, rather than a legitimate endeavor to preserve her claimed ownership interest in the property in question. A lis pendens may not be used as a substitute for an attachment to collect an alleged indebtedness. Montecalvo v. Mandarelli, 682 A.2d 918, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 219 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Equitable Lien.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A cause of action to enforce an equitable lien is an action affecting title to or an interest in real property, sufficient to support the filing of a notice of lis pendens. Darr v. Muratore, 143 B.R. 973, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12794 (D.R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Personal Property.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Purchasers Pendente Lite.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Title of purchasers of land pending suit concerning the land is not affected by the proceeding if no lis pendens is filed, unless the purchasers have actual notice of the proceeding. Sprague v. Stevens, 37 R.I. 1, 91 A. 43, 1914 R.I. LEXIS 61 (1914).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Vendees.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since an executory purchase-and-sale agreement vests in the vendee thereof equitable title to the land involved and a third party who purchases such land with notice of the vendee’s interest therein takes title subject to such interest and may in a proper case be directed to convey the land to the aggrieved vendee, such a vendee could properly file a notice of lis pendens subsequent to the third party’s purchase of the land.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The meaning of the words “other process” in this section was “complaint,” since that was the method established by the legislature to commence a complaint under the new form of pleadings. Sousa v. Casey, 111 R.I. 623, 306 A.2d 186, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1256 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Reasonable Time of Service.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A “reasonable time” within which a known defendant should be served under RCP, Rule 4, is not necessarily the same as a “reasonable time” within which an unknown defendant should be served pursuant to this section.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where plaintiff commenced his lawsuit on May 24, 1979 by way of a “John Doe” complaint but the actual defendants were not served with process until June, 1982, more than three years after the filing of the original complaint, such a delay in service was patently unreasonable. Westfall v. Whittaker, Clark &amp; Daniels, Metropolitan Talc Co., 571 F. Supp. 304, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14027 (D.R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Statute of Limitations.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was nothing in this section requiring service to be made within the statute of limitations but only that it be made within a reasonable time after a complaint has been filed unless there was a valid excuse for the delay. Sousa v. Casey, 111 R.I. 623, 306 A.2d 186, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1256 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The object of this section is to provide a plaintiff with an opportunity to toll the applicable statute of limitations against a fictitiously named defendant upon the filing of a complaint. Souza v. Erie Strayer Co., 557 A.2d 1226, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 89 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A material question of fact exists regarding the effective service of process on an unknown defendant whose identity is later discovered, precluding summary judgment on a statute of limitations defense in a personal injury action.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-5-20 did not toll R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14(b) in an employee’s defamation action, based on the employee’s filing of a “John Doe” complaint, because R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-5-20 did not apply, as the employee admitted the employee knew the identity of a detective whose report contained the alleged defamatory statements. Sola v. Leighton, 45 A.3d 502, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 78 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court properly granted summary judgment in favor of a condominium association in a pedestrian’s personal injury action because the three-year statute of limitations was not tolled by the provisions of the fictitious name statute, § 9-5-20, where the pedestrian knew the identity of the association before the statutory period expired, and her confusion over the name simply did not change the fact that she knew the identity of the association. Garant v. Winchester, 150 A.3d 606, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 124 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Substitution of Actual Party.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff was entitled to substitute multiple corporations even though original complaint only mentioned “John Doe Corporation.” Westfall v. Whittaker, Clark &amp; Daniels, Metropolitan Talc Co., 571 F. Supp. 304, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14027 (D.R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once having used a fictitious name in place of an unidentified defendant, this section does not permit a plaintiff to then give up the search for the identity of the real defendant. Grossi v. Miriam Hosp., 689 A.2d 403, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 49 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Due Diligence Obligation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A “due diligence” obligation is imposed upon plaintiff in order to bring the real defendant into the litigation and to subject that defendant to the jurisdiction of the particular court by proper reasonable notice and diligent service. Grossi v. Miriam Hosp., 689 A.2d 403, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 49 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Summary Judgments.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The failure to name another John Doe defendant in the amended complaint did not completely cut off any action against an additional defendant so long as due diligence had been exercised by the plaintiff to bring that defendant before the court, and whether due diligence was exercised is a question of fact, which is impossible to determine on a motion for summary judgment.

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A defendant’s minimalist and conclusory assertions that he neither resided in the state nor intended to submit himself “as an individual” to the state’s jurisdiction did not preclude the very real possibility that he, as an out-of-state corporate officer, engaged in acts from which a state court could properly conclude that it had personal jurisdiction over him, such as personally guaranteeing a contract or running the corporation when the corporate charter was revoked. Video Prods. Distribs. v. Kilsey, 682 A.2d 1381, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 235 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Cause of Action Arising in State.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action for the wrongful death of a student of Brown University at Providence caused by the electrocution of the student while using certain high voltage electrophoresis equipment sold to Brown University by the defendant, who was a New York resident, brought in the district court of the eastern district of New York by plaintiffs, who were residents of Maryland, arose in Rhode Island and could be transferred to the Rhode Island district court on motion of defendant even though defendant had no contacts in the state of Rhode Island other than the sale in question. Rosen v. Savant Instruments, Inc., 264 F. Supp. 232, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7263 (E.D.N.Y. 1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a health network allegedly authorized treatment of one of its members and later denied doing so, the court had jurisdiction over the matter under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-5-33 because if such approval was in fact conferred, it should have been evident to the network that the authorization would induce the hospital to provide medical care and the economic impacts of non-payment for such care would be felt in the forum state. Women &amp; Infants Hosp. v. Cmty. Health Network of Conn., Inc., 394 F. Supp. 2d 488, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7495 (D.R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Cause of Action Arising Outside State.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where foreign corporation owns stock in one of its subsidiaries within a state but had considerably less than total control over the subsidiary, and a cause of action attempting to gain in personam jurisdiction over that foreign corporation arose out of activities which were unconnected with this state, the totality of contacts does not give in personam jurisdiction. Conn v. ITT Aetna Fin. Co., 105 R.I. 397, 252 A.2d 184, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 770 (1969).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Personal jurisdiction over the defendant for a claim arising from a car accident which occurred in Massachusetts could not be based on the defendant’s residence or his unilateral decision to do business with the Rhode Island registry of motor vehicles in order to reinstate his license. Messier v. Belisle, 640 A.2d 959, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 132 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Personal jurisdiction was properly exercised under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-5-33(1) and in accordance with the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution over a nonresident defendant competitor because the competitor’s conduct in Florida and California was a cause of the breach of contract that occurred in Rhode Island, the in-forum injury was clearly related to the tortious interference claim, it was foreseeable that the competitor could be accountable for its actions in Rhode Island since it knew of the contract and was told by counsel that there could be a problem in hiring defendant former employee, and the gestalt factors militated strongly in favor of jurisdiction in Rhode Island. Astro-Med, Inc. v. Nihon Kohden Am., Inc., 591 F.3d 1, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 23298 (1st Cir. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Constitutional Limits.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Supreme Court of Rhode Island has interpreted Rhode Island’s long-arm statute as reaching to the full breadth of the fourteenth amendment’s due process clause. Rhode Island Hospital Trust Nat'l Bank v. San Gabriel Hydroelectric Partnership, 667 F. Supp. 66, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8131 (D.R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because Rhode Island has extended its longarm statute, § 9-5-33, to the extent permitted by the federal constitution, there are no separate state statutory requirements for the exercise of jurisdiction. The fundamental question is, thus, whether the defendant’s conduct and connection with the forum state are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there. O'Neil v. Picillo, 682 F. Supp. 706, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2737 (D.R.I. 1988), aff'd, 883 F.2d 176, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 12314 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rhode Island’s long arm statute, under R.I.

<p class="p7"><b>Contracts.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action by a Massachusetts corporation admitted to do business and having its principal office in Rhode Island, against some sixty corporations located in states along the eastern seaboard for declaratory judgment as to the validity of agreements for licensing defendants to use certain patents owned by plaintiff in exchange for royalties, jurisdiction over the persons of defendants existed by virtue of the following factors: The contracts between the parties, final execution of the contracts in Rhode Island, and various relations supportive of the central exchange of use to licensees for royalties to licensor, including in particular plaintiff’s machinery sales and leasing, plaintiff’s development and design program, plaintiff’s service and parts sales, plaintiff’s instructional program, and plaintiff’s account audit methods. Leesona Corp. v. Concordia Mfg. Co., 312 F. Supp. 392, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12009 (D.R.I. 1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Jurisdiction over an out-of-state corporation was proper, based on a contractual relationship which contemplated a consistent course of communications, as to sales and orders, between a Rhode Island corporation, which obligated itself to be the out-of-state corporation’s exclusive representative to a portion of its jewelry trade, and the out-of-state corporation. Dynamic Concepts, Inc. v. Modern Chain Mfg. Co., 610 F. Supp. 285, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18949 (D.R.I. 1985).</p>

World Am Communs., Inc., 263 F. Supp. 2d 338, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8668 (D.R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Forfeiture.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in dismissing an employee’s complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction because an employer forfeited his jurisdictional defense by proceeding through discovery, arbitration, and pretrial litigation for more than three and a half years after raising the defense in his answer; because the employer forfeited the jurisdictional defense, the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice were not offended by requiring him to acquiesce to the jurisdiction of the State. Pullar v. Cappelli, 148 A.3d 551, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 116 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction by Waiver.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant waived his right to move for dismissal for lack of the minimum contacts in Rhode Island required by this section by failure to join that motion with a previously-filed motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a proceeding by a mother for support of herself and her child under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, the mother’s argument that the nonresident father waived the jurisdictional issue by filing an affidavit showing his present needs ignored the provisions of the Family Court Rules of Procedure for Domestic Relations allowing alternative pleading, specifically Rule 12(b), which in its relevant parts states that no defense is waived by being joined with one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or motion. Carrillo v. Carrillo, 523 A.2d 439, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 440 (R.I. 1987).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Minimum Contacts.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although defendant airline had no property in Rhode Island and did not render any transportation to or from any point in Rhode Island, nevertheless where it advertised its services in Rhode Island, and authorized another airline to act as its agent in Rhode Island, for the issuance of tickets, such corporation had sufficient minimum contacts to subject it to suit in Rhode Island. Del Sesto v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 201 F. Supp. 879, 1962 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4011 (D.R.I. 1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that a syndicated article written by defendant was published in a Rhode Island newspaper, which used a picture of the defendant in advertising the appearance of the syndicated column in the newspaper was not such a “minimum contact” as would permit the bringing of a libel action against the defendant in Rhode Island under this section. Riverhouse Publishing Co. v. Porter, 287 F. Supp. 1, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8414 (D.R.I. 1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A manufacturing corporation which marketed its products in Rhode Island and other New England states through a Rhode Island corporation serving as a manufacturer’s representative and selling such products and serving as the manufacturer’s agent in all relations between the manufacturer and the purchasers had the necessary minimum contacts required by this section to make it amenable to suit in Rhode Island.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the plaintiff was a foreign corporation admitted to do business and having its principal office in Rhode Island, and defendants were located in several other states and were licensed by plaintiff to use certain apparatus and processes for which plaintiff held patents and for which defendants paid royalties to plaintiff, such relationship constituted sufficient minimal contacts to give Rhode Island courts jurisdiction of an action involving such relationship. Leesona Corp. v. Concordia Mfg. Co., 312 F. Supp. 392, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12009 (D.R.I. 1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was evidence of substantial business activity between the plaintiff and foreign defendant, the exercise of “long arm” jurisdiction was justified, even though the defendant did not hold itself out for business in any identifiable Rhode Island market but rather limited its contacts with Rhode Island to its transactions with the plaintiff. Scott Brass, Inc. v. Wire &amp; Metal Specialties Corp., 344 F. Supp. 711, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13357 (D.R.I. 1972).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The limitations on in personam jurisdiction over a non-resident corporation are twofold, requiring the establishment of “minimum contacts” by the nonresident in accordance with both federal constitutional and state statutory limitations and the Rhode Island long arm statute permits the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign corporations up to the constitutional limit. White v. Shiller Chemicals, Inc., 379 F. Supp. 101, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13008 (D.R.I.), aff'd, 503 F.2d 1396 (1st Cir. 1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant practiced as a physician in this state for over three years, enjoying the benefits and protection of Rhode Island law, and the alleged tort arose out of those activities and actually occurred in this state, the defendant had sufficient minimum contacts with Rhode Island to satisfy the requirements of this section.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Massachusetts medical facility that actively solicited Rhode Islanders as patients had requisite minimum contacts with Rhode Island, and “solicitation plus” was unnecessary, given the nature of the facility, to establish Rhode Island’s jurisdiction over it.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action brought in Rhode Island against a Massachusetts physician for services performed in Massachusetts, the physician’s status as a nonresident agent of a medical facility which had contacts with Rhode Island was insufficient to establish her own minimum contacts with the forum state.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Long-arm jurisdiction was available where the direct actual contacts of a Florida banking corporation with Rhode Island consisted of repeated phone calls, correspondence including commitment forms, the cashing of a $55,000 check obtained from Rhode Island and drawn on a Rhode Island bank, a contemplated complex future involvement and extensive interstate loan operations on the part of the Florida bank. E. F. Hutton &amp; Co. v. Tourism &amp; Development Corp., 455 F. Supp. 981, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16179 (D.R.I. 1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For purposes of determining whether state courts could exercise in personam jurisdiction over a Massachusetts bank, the following circumstances were insufficient to establish minimum contacts between the state and the bank: (1) the bank had Rhode Island customers, (2) a Massachusetts telephone book listing the bank was regularly distributed in Rhode Island, and (3) the bank administered a trust that owned Rhode Island property. Roger Williams Gen. Hosp. v. Fall River Trust Co., 423 A.2d 1384, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1012 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although advertising on a Rhode Island television station clearly demonstrated that a Massachusetts bank intended to solicit the business of Rhode Island residents, the fact that such advertising ceased some four months prior to the events in question was sufficient to terminate the contacts between Rhode Island and the bank for purposes of determining whether state courts could exercise in personam jurisdiction over the bank.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Procedure.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The 1957 amendment to this section which eliminated provisions extending an option to certain classes of persons to claim exemption from jury service did not establish a new system of drawing grand jurors or require the preparation of new jury lists, and defendant, who was tried and convicted by jury drawn after effective date of amendment was not denied any substantial right because jury was selected from a 1956 list which did not include persons exempted under prior law. State v. Kieon, 89 R.I. 320, 152 A.2d 531, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 80 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The present exemptions granted to members of specific occupations do not violate cross-section requirements for jury selection. State v. Courteau, 461 A.2d 1358, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 963 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Classes Formerly Exempted.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where jury commissioners excluded “the president, professors, tutors and students of recognized universities and colleges” such grand jury was composed in violation of constitutional requirements. State v. Jenison, 122 R.I. 142, 405 A.2d 3, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2142 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where college students and professors wishing to be exempted from jury duty could obtain such exemption by affirmatively claiming such status, as opposed to there being an automatic exemption from jury duty for such persons, there was no ground for finding a violation of the fair cross-section requirement of U.S. Const., amend. 6, absent a showing that a cognizable class of persons had been excluded from jury service. State v. Bassett, 447 A.2d 371, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 925 (R.I. 1982) (decided prior to 1980 amendment to § 9-9-3, eliminating exemption for college students and professors).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The former exemptions from jury service for college students and professors were reasonable and did not violate the cross-section requirements imposed by the U.S. Const., amend. 6. State v. Courteau, 461 A.2d 1358, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 963 (R.I. 1983); State v. Conway, 463 A.2d 1319, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1039 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Procedure.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendants who raise the issue of the absence from a jury of representative of an identifiable segment of the community must prove that the absence is due to a preconceived exclusionary plan by those responsible for the formulation of the jury lists.

<p class="p7"><b>Order of Jurors.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mere fact that, in the selection of a grand jury, through mistake or accident the prospective jurors were not notified in the precise order in which their names appeared on the list will not vitiate the proceedings of the grand jury.

<p class="p7"><b>Place of Residence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the jurisdiction of the superior court includes geographically the counties of Providence and Bristol and since the jurisdiction of the grand jury is coextensive with that of the court under whose supervision it is impaneled, it is the court’s opinion that with respect to grand jury proceedings the combined counties are a “county” within the meaning of the declarement of common law where all members of the grand jury must be residents of the county for which they are sworn to inquire. Therefore, there is no merit in defendant’s contention that the statute which authorized the Bristol residents to serve on the instant grand jury is unconstitutional. State v. Edwards, 89 R.I. 378, 153 A.2d 153, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 96 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The term “county” is used to define the territorial limits of the jurisdiction of the grand jury, and since it is merely an appendage of the court for which it is summoned and authorized to inquire, its jurisdiction may be made coextensive with that of the court’s jurisdiction and the territory over which such jurisdiction extends and not necessarily confined to the geographical lines of any county. Therefore, it is clear that the legislature by the enactment of G.L. 1938, ch. 506, § 37, now § 12-11-2, expressly provided that the jurisdiction of the grand jury would be coextensive with that of the court when sitting for those counties.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Peremptory challenge of jurors during impaneling was properly allowed in a civil action. Graves v. Horgan, 21 R.I. 493, 45 A. 152, 1899 R.I. LEXIS 121 (1899).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Co-Defendants.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there is more than one defendant, the defendants collectively are considered the “party.” State v. Sutton, 10 R.I. 159, 1872 R.I. LEXIS 4 (1872); State v. Brown, 45 R.I. 9, 119 A. 324, 1923 R.I. LEXIS 8 (1923).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was in no way prejudiced by reason of the refusal of the court to grant him a separate trial even though such ruling might reduce the number of peremptory challenges available to him.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The consideration of several defendants as one party for the purpose of peremptory challenges in jury selection does not violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution because the classification which treats several defendants tried jointly the same as one defendant tried alone was not shown to be either irrational or irrelevant to a legitimate state purpose. State v. Lerner, 112 R.I. 62, 308 A.2d 324, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 957 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Prejudice of Jury.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant could not get new trial on ground that it was impossible for him to receive a fair trial in the county of the murder due to public opinion and juror prejudice where he examined each juror as to prejudice and yet did not use all of his peremptory challenges and where the jurors were not allowed to separate and heard nothing of the case outside the courtroom. State v. Hathaway, 52 R.I. 492, 161 A. 366, 1932 R.I. LEXIS 96 (1932).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Privilege Granted by Section.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Action of Account.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action of account in the district court the only right to jury trial is on the judgment to account, not on the auditor’s report. White v. Eddy, 19 R.I. 108, 31 A. 823, 1895 R.I. LEXIS 39 (1895).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Appeal Bond.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the usual appeal from the district court to the superior court, the appellant must only pay certain litigation costs, but eviction proceedings necessitate the posting of an appeal bond pursuant to § 9-12-12 as well. Oaks v. District Court of Rhode Island, 631 F. Supp. 538, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27371 (D.R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Decision and Judgment Distinguished.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under provisions giving a party a right to claim a jury trial “after a decision is made,” a plaintiff who consented to entry of decision in favor of defendant was entitled to claim a jury trial, since decision was not a judgment in the technical sense. Dorney v. Ives, 36 R.I. 276, 90 A. 164, 1914 R.I. LEXIS 22 (1914).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Demand for Jury.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although written claim for jury should be filed with clerk of superior court, the requirement is satisfied if such claim is filed with district court clerk and transmitted with other papers to superior court clerk and received before assignment day. Agnew v. Max, 57 R.I. 452, 190 A. 436, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 109 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Enjoining Enforcement of Judgment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The enforcement of a judgment at law will not be enjoined in equity when the defendant failed to take advantage of the methods open to him to review such judgment and neglected to allege a meritorious defense to such action. Opie v. Clancy, 27 R.I. 42, 60 A. 635, 1905 R.I. LEXIS 21 (1905).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Failure to Enter Appearance.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant failed to enter appearance within the prescribed time it became the duty of the court to disregard the claim of jury trial filed by the petitioner, to default said case, and to enter judgment for the plaintiff therein as of the entry date of the writ. Mathewson v. Lewis, 33 R.I. 398, 82 A. 34, 1912 R.I. LEXIS 95 (1912).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Joint Defendants.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where decision of district court was against both of two joint defendants, claim by one defendant for jury trial under G.L. 1896, ch. 237, § 7, would be dismissed. Bassett v. Loewenstein, 22 R.I. 468, 48 A. 589, 1901 R.I. LEXIS 35 (1901).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A joint defendant had the right to join codefendants in claim for jury trial under G.L. 1896, ch. 237, § 7, and common pleas division upon motion should have imposed costs accruing therein upon the moving appellant. Bassett v. Loewenstein, 22 R.I. 468, 48 A. 589, 1901 R.I. LEXIS 35 (1901).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Mistake or Neglect of Clerk.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where plaintiff duly claimed jury trial and paid costs, under G.L. 1896, ch. 237, § 7, he did all that was required, and failure of clerk of district court to certify and transmit the case and papers, as required by G.L. 1896, ch. 237, § 8, did not deprive common pleas division of jurisdiction when such case was certified. Wilbur v. Best, 22 R.I. 550, 48 A. 824, 1901 R.I. LEXIS 53 (1901).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the plaintiff did nothing in the original action with regard to removal of the suit from the district to the superior court except to claim a jury trial in writing upon the entry day of the writ, the mere fact that clerk of the district court sent the papers to the superior court without waiting to see whether defendant answered did not work a discontinuance where the papers were promptly returned to the district court. Needle v. H. C. Biddle &amp; Co., 32 R.I. 342, 79 A. 942, 1911 R.I. LEXIS 42 (1911).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The superior court on motion will permit the clerk of the district court to amend a clerical error on the record. Grieco v. Jackvony, 43 R.I. 26, 109 A. 801, 1920 R.I. LEXIS 27 (1920).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court is not prevented from acquiring jurisdiction if the appealing party has paid the total costs as taxed by the clerk and has otherwise complied with the statute, even though clerk mistakenly set too small a sum. Plastic Merchandisers v. Royal Moulding Co., 57 R.I. 510, 190 A. 788, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 127 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Motions for Summary Judgments.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no language in this section from which it can be implied that motions for summary judgments are excluded from the provisions thereof. Nor is there any language in the Summary Judgment Law from which it can reasonably be implied that the legislature intended to exclude such motions from the provisions of this section. To hold otherwise would be to bar a plaintiff’s right to be heard on a motion for a summary judgment in every instance upon defendant’s appeal from a district court’s decision. What Cheer Aluminum Window Co. v. Marc-Sterling Realty Corp., 89 R.I. 367, 153 A.2d 133, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 91 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The superior court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the motions for summary judgment and justice and orderly procedure will be best served by remitting these cases to the superior court so that the trial justice may hear the motions and determine the sufficiency of petitioner’s affidavits of no defense and thereafter proceed in accordance with former § 9-7-3 to determine whether there is an issue of fact to be tried and that the respondents have a defense to the action. What Cheer Aluminum Window Co. v. Marc-Sterling Realty Corp., 89 R.I. 367, 153 A.2d 133, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 91 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Payment of Attorney’s Fees.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statutory provision for the payment of costs is separate and distinct from that for the payment of an attorney’s fee, and, since the legislature did not intend nonattorney litigants to be compensated for their own services, the appealing party need pay the attorney’s fee only if the adverse party is represented by an attorney. Goulet v. Dalton, 117 R.I. 304, 366 A.2d 537, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1629 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Payment of Costs.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former provisions of the statute providing that if either party to a proceeding in district court claimed a jury trial, the case was to be certified to the superior court were contingent upon payment of jury costs, and if party requesting jury trial refused to pay costs, the case would not be certified. Spencer v. District Court of Sixth Judicial Dist., 37 R.I. 466, 93 A. 647, 1915 R.I. LEXIS 22 (1915).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff appealing from nominal judgment in his favor was not required to pay any costs other than attorney fees where the judgment appealed from did not assess costs against him. Plastic Merchandisers v. Royal Moulding Co., 57 R.I. 510, 190 A. 788, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 127 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although § 9-29-14 exempts the Legal Aid Society and its clients from the payment in advance of those initial fees and charges of litigation which are required in the ordinary case, it does not extend the exemption to the payment of costs for the purpose of perfecting an appeal to the superior court under this section. Ainsworth v. Saybrooke Mfg. Co., 60 R.I. 290, 198 A. 348, 1938 R.I. LEXIS 146 (1938).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The district court has inherent power at common law to waive the costs of appeal required to be paid under this section in the case of an indigent defendant in an action for possession of tenements. Jones v. Aciz, 110 R.I. 911, 289 A.2d 44, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 1020 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any defendant who desires to appeal the judgment in an action for trespass and ejectment must pay the litigation costs required by this section, and must also post bond “to pay all monies due, or which may become due pending the action under the tenancy, and such damages and costs as may be awarded against him . . .” under § 9-12-12. Oaks v. District Court of Rhode Island, 631 F. Supp. 538, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27371 (D.R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Right of Appeal.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An appeal, in the nature of a trial de novo, is provided to the parties in the state superior court, as long as certain litigation costs are prepaid by the appellant. Oaks v. District Court of Rhode Island, 631 F. Supp. 538, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27371 (D.R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A garnishee who claims to be erroneously charged is a person aggrieved and entitled to appeal to the superior court on both questions of law and fact, so he is not entitled to a review by writ of certiorari. George E. Merewether, Inc. v. Equi, 53 R.I. 148, 165 A. 219, 1933 R.I. LEXIS 48 (1933).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A plaintiff may appeal to the superior court the discharge of a garnishee even though he has had judgment in the full amount of his claim against the principal defendant.

<p class="p7"><b>Time of Appeal.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where tortfeasors had lost a case before the district court and instructed defense counsel to file the matter in the superior court, defense counsel’s failure to follow the clients’ instructions until two days after the appellate deadline did not qualify as an accident, mistake, unforeseen cause, or excusable neglect allowing an appeal to be taken out of time under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-21-6. Carlson v. Bedford, 828 A.2d 516, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 121 (R.I. 2003).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A petition for certiorari to the state supreme court is not a proper vehicle for the review of a district court order denying a motion to vacate, since such order possesses all the attributes of finality so as to be subject to appeal pursuant to this section and absent unusual hardship or exceptional circumstances the supreme court has traditionally refused to review by certiorari a case where direct appeal lies. Murphy v. Charlie's Home Improvement Co., 117 R.I. 324, 366 A.2d 809, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1633 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendants appealed the district court’s denial of their motion to vacate a default judgment, pursuant to R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The failure of a defendant in an action for eviction to pay the costs assessed by the district court, in the absence of a claim of indigence or waiver of said costs, justifies the superior court in dismissing an appeal and denying the defendant the trial de novo that would otherwise be available to him.

<p class="p7"><b>— Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The district court has the inherent power at common law to waive the costs of appeal required to be paid by an indigent defendant who appeals a judgment in an action for possession of tenements. However, the court must remain cognizant that the burden is upon the party appealing to prove that he or she is absolutely unable to pay the costs of appeal. Chrysler First Fin. Servs. Corp. v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A decree entered under the provisions of this section authorizing party to engage counsel to defend former decree and to pay such counsel out of the assets of the trust estate was a final decree from which an appeal was allowed.

<p class="p7"><b>Estate or Fund From Which Payable.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a proceeding for the construction of a clause relative to distribution of one-half of the proceeds of a trust established by such clause, the costs of the proceedings were chargeable against the general assets of the trust and not solely against the one-half interest. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Co. v. Johnston, 81 R.I. 115, 99 A.2d 12, 1953 R.I. LEXIS 22 (1953).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action to construe a will and trust, where the testator, after designating certain assets to be held in trust for the beneficiaries, directed that his residuary estate be used to pay the expenses of caring for and managing the assets held for the beneficiaries, the counsel fees and other expenses of such action should be paid from such residuary estate.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there were two trusts created in the same will, and the second trust was much more depleted than the first trust, it was fairer for the attorney fees to be paid out of the first trust, so as to ensure that the second trust would not be exhausted by attorney fees.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section guardians ad litem and their attorneys representing minor who made a not entirely spurious claim to participate in the benefits of a trust were entitled to fees taxed as costs to the trust estate in a suit brought by trustee to construe its deed of trust, to which suit the minor was a necessary party. Industrial Nat'l Bank v. Isele, 110 R.I. 157, 290 A.2d 903, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 893 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In action brought by the trustee to construe a deed of trust, disallowance of counsel fees to attorneys for necessary minor defendant and his mother for services rendered prior to commencement of the suit was not an abuse of the discretion granted trial courts under this section.

Sasso v. Housing Auth., 82 R.I. 451, 111 A.2d 226, 1955 R.I. LEXIS 93 (1955).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was an abuse of discretion to allow the jury to see the property long after it was taken by the state and after the conditions of the premises had materially changed for the worse.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Order and conduct of view by jury is discretionary with the court. State v. Germain, 47 R.I. 269, 132 A. 734, 1926 R.I. LEXIS 45 (1926); State v. Francis, 78 R.I. 73, 79 A.2d 177, 1951 R.I. LEXIS 37 (1951).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a proceeding for assessment of damages, the object of a view is to aid the jury to understand more clearly the evidence presented at the trial and such an order is discretionary with the trial justice.

<p class="p7"><b>Object of View.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The object of a view of the premises is not to get evidence but was merely to enable the court and jury to more clearly understand the evidence presented at the trial. State v. Congdon, 14 R.I. 458, 1884 R.I. LEXIS 30 (1884); State v. Germain, 47 R.I. 269, 132 A. 734, 1926 R.I. LEXIS 45 (1926); State v. Smith, 70 R.I. 500, 41 A.2d 153, 1945 R.I.

<p class="p7"><b>Presence of Accused.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the view was granted at the request of the defense and the prisoner did not ask to be permitted to go to the view and made no objection either then or afterwards during the trial because he did not go, the prisoner must be held to have waived his privilege. State v. Congdon, 14 R.I. 458, 1884 R.I. LEXIS 30 (1884).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a murder prosecution, the defendant suffered no prejudice as a result of his voluntarily absenting himself from a view of the evidence, in the face of the decision by the state marshals to shackle him during the course of the view. It is certainly proper to require a person accused of a most violent crime to be reasonably restrained by handcuffs and/or shackles in an open area in the presence of jurors and other participants. In any event, the defendant’s presence at the view was not a critical state of the trial, since his participation would have been virtually nonexistent except to have been certain that the jurors were brought to the right place to which the evidence later presented would have appropriately related. State v. Hightower, 661 A.2d 948, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 200 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Self Incrimination.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court’s granting of the state’s motion to have the jury view the premises in question, was not in violation of the defendant’s constitutional rights as to self incrimination. State v. Smith, 70 R.I. 500, 41 A.2d 153, 1945 R.I. LEXIS 5 (1945).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Time of Order.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is no abuse of discretion that a view is ordered while the defendant is testifying. State v. Francis, 78 R.I. 73, 79 A.2d 177, 1951 R.I. LEXIS 37 (1951).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fair trial concept requires the trial justice to instruct the jury at the time a prior conviction is received into evidence that it is being admitted for the sole purpose of impeaching credibility and is otherwise without probative value. Mercurio v. Fascitelli, 107 R.I. 511, 268 A.2d 427, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 802 (1970); State v. O'Brien, 122 R.I. 749, 412 A.2d 231, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1469 (1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the trial justice ought to have admonished the jury as to the purpose of evidence of prior convictions at the time the evidence was received on the record, the defendant was not prejudiced by a belated admonition during the charge to the jury. State v. Pope, 414 A.2d 781, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1640 (R.I. 1980), overruled in part, State v. Acquisto, 463 A.2d 122, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1012 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A witness may be impeached by evidence of a prior conviction, regardless of the possible prejudice or of whether the conviction was for a crime relating to dishonesty or false statement. State v. Aptt, 441 A.2d 824, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 809 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Conflict of Laws.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining the admissibility of evidence that a witness has been convicted of a crime in another jurisdiction a trial court must follow the rules of evidence of the state in which the conviction occurred. Solomon v. Shepard Co., 61 R.I. 332, 200 A. 993, 1938 R.I. LEXIS 74 (1938).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Defendant Testifying.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the defendant in a criminal action takes the stand to testify in his own behalf the state may impeach his credibility by showing previous convictions of felonies. State v. McGuire, 15 R.I. 23, 22 A. 1118, 1885 R.I. LEXIS 43 (1885).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When an accused voluntarily chooses to testify in his own behalf, the prosecution has the right to cross-examine him in respect to such testimony with the same latitude as would be exercised in the case of an ordinary witness regarding the circumstances connecting him with the alleged crime. State v. Wallace, 428 A.2d 1070, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1106 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where prosecution’s cross-examination of the defendant had ceased, but the trial court allowed a reopening of such cross-examination to allow the prosecution to impeach the defendant with prior convictions, this was not tantamount to calling defendant as the state’s witness nor was it an abuse of the trial court’s discretion. State v. Wallace, 428 A.2d 1070, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1106 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As the prosecutor’s questions to defendant during cross-examination about his alleged prior crimes impermissibly introduced false evidence of his criminal conduct and improperly implied he was previously charged with a crime without an evidentiary basis for that suggestion, and the error was not harmless because the questions were significantly prejudicial to defendant, he was entitled to new trial. State v. Price, 68 A.3d 440, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Discretion of Court.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no hard and fast rule which requires the trial justice to sustain or overrule an objection to the testimony of a witness who had been convicted of an offense, on the grounds of alleged remoteness of the offense. The better rule is to leave this matter to the sound discretion of the trial justice subject to be reviewed by the Supreme Court only for abuse of such discretion. Pedorella v. Hoffman, 91 R.I. 487, 165 A.2d 721, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 125 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Nothing in the adoption of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence alters the discretion of the trial justice to rule on the admissibility of prior convictions for impeachment purposes. State v. Mattatall, 586 A.2d 1061, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 23 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court did not err in denying a defendant’s motion in limine to preclude the use of the defendant’s prior criminal record for impeachment purposes, because a strong showing of probative value is not necessary to warrant admissibility, only that the probative value substantially outweighs the prejudicial effect. The trial court is endowed with discretion when determining the admissibility of prior convictions in impeaching the credibility of witnesses. State v. Martinez, 651 A.2d 1189, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 294 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Impeachment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where conviction in district court was appealed to superior court such appeal automatically vacated the conviction in the district court and pending such appeal the conviction in the district court could not be used for impeachment purposes under this section. State v. Roderick, 121 R.I. 896, 403 A.2d 1090, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2037 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even illegally obtained evidence may be admitted for impeachment purposes when a defendant gives testimony that may be construed as absolving himself from fault in a criminal case. State v. Dowell, 512 A.2d 121, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 516 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice did not err in allowing the prosecution to impeach the credibility of the defendant by reading the specific nature of two convictions for disorderly conduct. State v. Dowell, 512 A.2d 121, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 516 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A witness may be impeached by evidence of a prior conviction, regardless of whether there is possible prejudice or whether the conviction was for a crime involving dishonesty or false statement. State v. Moretti, 521 A.2d 1003, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 422 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A defendant’s bare assertion that he was impermissibly denied counsel or that he could not recall whether he was impermissibly denied counsel at the time he was convicted of prior offenses was not sufficient to prevent the use of the prior convictions for impeachment purposes. State v. Moretti, 521 A.2d 1003, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 422 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While it can certainly be said that Rule 609 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence was not intended to replace this section, there can be no question that it places the statute in a new light. However, nothing in the rule suggests or implies that decisions regarding the admissibility of prior convictions for impeachment purposes are no longer discretionary matters for the trial justice to decide. State v. Maxie, 554 A.2d 1028, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 17 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the defendant had committed at least four criminal offenses from 1980 through 1995, which the trial justice presumably determined to be sufficient to establish a continuing period of misconduct, it was not an abuse of discretion to rule that the state could use the prior convictions to impeach the defendant, should he take the stand, since those convictions suggested a pattern of criminal activity not wholly unrelated to the case at hand. State v. Walsh, 731 A.2d 696, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 119 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Introduction of Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is proper to examine the witness himself as to former convictions of crime. State v. Ellwood, 17 R.I. 763, 24 A. 782, 1892 R.I. LEXIS 79 (1892).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Mistrial.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, after defendant had admitted on cross-examination nine convictions, the prosecutor asked him if such convictions did not total ten, to which question the court sustained defendant’s objection, it was not error to deny defendant’s motion for a mistrial. State v. McCartin, 106 R.I. 674, 262 A.2d 826, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 973 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Nolo Contendere.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Payment by defendant of a fine by way of settlement of a prior nuisance proceeding following plea of nolo contendere could not be introduced into evidence where there was no conviction or sentence. State v. Conway, 20 R.I. 270, 38 A. 656, 1897 R.I. LEXIS 106 (1897).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sentence to imprisonment for crime may be shown to affect credibility, even though the sentence was based on a plea of nolo contendere. State v. Vanasse, 42 R.I. 278, 107 A. 85, 1919 R.I. LEXIS 31 (1919).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was proper for district attorney to question defendant as to whether he had pleaded nolo contendere to an indictment and paid a fine. Fisher v. United States, 8 F.2d 978, 1925 U.S. App. LEXIS 3417 (1st Cir. 1925), cert. denied, 271 U.S. 666, 46 S. Ct. 482, 70 L. Ed. 1140, 1926 U.S. LEXIS 736 (1926).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Offenses Within Statute.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the provisions of this section a witness may be asked whether he has been convicted of or sentenced for any crime and the statute does not limit the evidence to infamous crimes or misdemeanors. Brown v. Howard, 43 R.I. 571, 114 A. 11, 1921 R.I. LEXIS 31 (1921).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a personal injury action arising out of an automobile accident, defendant’s prior convictions for traffic violations, including speeding, although unrelated to his honesty, should nonetheless have been admitted to impeach his credibility pursuant to this section. Mercurio v. Fascitelli, 107 R.I. 511, 268 A.2d 427, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 802 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Finality of Conviction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “conviction” as used in this section means any conviction, whether final or not, and the pendency of an appeal does not bar the use of a conviction for the purpose of impeachment. State v. Rollins, 116 R.I. 528, 359 A.2d 315, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1303 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Plea of Nolo Contendere.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A plea of nolo contendere followed by probation is not a conviction for purposes of impeaching a witness in an unrelated proceeding. State v. Young, 456 A.2d 739, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 813 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Remoteness of Conviction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rejection for remoteness of four traffic convictions occurring less than three years prior to the day of the trial where they were offered into evidence would have been a clear abuse of discretion. Mercurio v. Fascitelli, 107 R.I. 511, 268 A.2d 427, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 802 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where evidence of prior convictions was not inadmissible for being too remote at the original trial, obviously this same evidence should not be rejected at a retrial on remoteness grounds. Mercurio v. Fascitelli, 116 R.I. 237, 354 A.2d 736, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1271 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is within the discretion of the trial judge to determine whether evidence of prior convictions for the purpose of impeachment should be excluded because of remoteness, and a criminal defendant may utilize the procedural device of a motion in limine for the exclusion of such evidence. State v. Bennett, 122 R.I. 276, 405 A.2d 1181, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2157 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whenever a party seeks to impeach a witness by evidence of a prior conviction, it is incumbent on the trial court, sua sponte, to consider whether the conviction is too remote in time to be of any present probative value. State v. O’Brien, 122 R.I. 749, 412 A.2d 231 (1980). In accord with fourth paragraph in bound volume. See State v. Lariviere, 527 A.2d 648, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 518 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Remoteness is the sole crucial factor to be considered by a trial court when an effort is made to impeach a witness’ credibility by evidence of his prior involvement with the law. State v. Pope, 414 A.2d 781, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1640 (R.I. 1980), overruled in part, State v. Acquisto, 463 A.2d 122, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1012 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Remoteness is not measured solely by the passage of time; a trial court can take into account convictions intervening between the past conviction and the crime for which the defendant is being tried, since the factfinder has a right to consider whether one who repeatedly refuses to comply with the law is more likely to ignore the obligation of truthfulness than a law-abiding citizen. State v. Pope, 414 A.2d 781, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1640 (R.I. 1980), overruled in part, State v. Acquisto, 463 A.2d 122, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1012 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A 1974 conviction was not too remote to be admitted to impeach the defendant at trial in 1980. State v. Aptt, 441 A.2d 824, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 809 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Remoteness is the sole basis upon which a trial justice can prohibit the use of a prior conviction of any crime or misdemeanor to impeach a witness’ credibility. State v. Lariviere, 527 A.2d 648, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 518 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While admission, to impeach a defendant charged with murder, of a 22-year-old conviction for disorderly conduct was error, the court must further determine whether the error was prejudicial, denying a fair trial. State v. Powell, 533 A.2d 530, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 561 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice does not abuse his discretion when he does not allow the defendant to impeach a witness through the use of a prior criminal conviction, where the conviction occurred approximately thirteen years prior to the trial, and, except for a single traffic offense, driving without a license, the witness has not been convicted of a crime in the intervening years. State v. Wilson, 568 A.2d 764, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 8 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Remoteness of a prior conviction is not measured solely by the passage of time. The trial justice must balance the remoteness of the conviction, the nature of the crime, and the defendant’s disdain for the law as represented by the extent of his prior criminal record, to determine whether the relevance with respect to credibility outweighs the prejudicial effect to the defendant. State v. Mattatall, 586 A.2d 1061, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 23 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Previous Arrest.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The credibility of a witness may not be impeached merely by a showing of an arrest or criminal accusation. State v. Sepe, 122 R.I. 560, 410 A.2d 127, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1423 (1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Probation Order.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Probation order was a judgment of conviction, finally and conclusively adjudicating the witness’ guilt, and such a record is admissible to impeach his credibility.

Additional time for cross-examination shall be at the adverse party’s expense. The expert witness fee provided by the proponent of the expert and the additional fee, if required on the part of the adverse party, may be included in the costs of the case payable to the prevailing party.

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not on its face violate due process or fundamental fairness to respondents by hindering cross-examination because it clearly considers the need to prevent the statute from being too broad-based or all-encompassing. It does not violate equal protection because corresponding concerns of each of the litigants are weighed and balanced by the trial justice in order to prevent manifest unfairness to a particular litigant. This section is also not unconstitutional as applied when the rights and interests of the parties to cross-examination are balanced, and any overriding concerns of a party are considered in order to prevent an unconstitutional application of the statute violating the rights of litigants. Martinez v. Kurdziel, 612 A.2d 669, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 171 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Admissibility of Blood-Alcohol Test Results.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for sexual assault, the trial justice’s decision to exclude the result of a blood-alcohol analysis of the victim’s blood on the night of the assault is proper, where, if the defendant had wanted the jury to know the results of the blood-alcohol-content test, he could have presented such evidence by introducing the medical record into evidence. Moreover, exclusion of the blood-alcohol content of the victim’s blood was not probative regarding the issue of the defendant’s guilt. State v. Griffin, 567 A.2d 796, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 170 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Affirmation and Oath.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As affidavits regarding plaintiff’s medical treatment were signed in the presence of a notary and stated that the truth of the factual statements containted therein were sworn to under oath, they were properly admitted in evidence under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-19-27; use of the statutory phrase, “subscribed and sworn to under the penalties of perjury,” was not required. Morel v. Napolitano, 64 A.3d 1176, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 71 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Insufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The medical evidence presented by the plaintiff was incompetent to establish that an assault and battery by the defendant was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s alleged injury. Picard v. Barry Pontiac-Buick, 654 A.2d 690, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 28 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Failure to Give Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a party fails to give the opposing party notice as required by this section, an affidavit he seeks to introduce is inadmissible although it meets all other requirements of this section, and the fact that the party and the court exerted extraordinary efforts to secure the attendance of the affiant as a witness at the trial does not alter such inadmissibility. Andrews v. Masse, 115 R.I. 104, 341 A.2d 30, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1126 (1975).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The providing of a ten-day notice as set forth in the statute is a condition precedent to the receipt in evidence of a physician’s affidavit. Proof of notice may be required by the trial justice at the time of the offer of the evidence. Hudson v. Napolitano, 575 A.2d 187, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 123 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice properly excluded psychologist’s affidavit because it did not comply with this section’s 10-day rule. Jameson v. Hawthorne, 635 A.2d 1167, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 1 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Medical records relating to injuries suffered by a plaintiff in auto accidents years before the one at issue should not have been admitted in evidence to challenge the plaintiff’s claims that all injuries were caused by the most recent accident, because notice had not been provided of the intent to offer them in evidence, as required by R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-19-27, and no foundation had been laid for offering them in evidence as businesss records under R.I. R. Evid. 803(6). Boscia v. Sharples, 860 A.2d 674, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 172 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Out-Of-State Affiant.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section clearly considers the out-of-state affiant who may be cross-examined by the opposing party at a deposition because he or she is outside the subpoena power of the state. Martinez v. Kurdziel, 612 A.2d 669, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 171 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Proximate Cause.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Medical affidavits dealing with treatment that occurred after an automobile collision are properly excluded where they do not individually establish any causal connection between the injuries complained of and the collision. Cuddy v. Schiavonne, 568 A.2d 1387, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 23 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not lessen the offering party’s burden to establish the relevancy and reasonableness standard for evidence. The offering party must still establish a causal relationship between the injury and the physical condition claimed to have resulted from it. All the evidentiary requirements must still be met and are not relaxed in any manner. Martinez v. Kurdziel, 612 A.2d 669, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 171 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Degree of Certainty.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although absolute certainty is not required, a medical expert must report that the injuries incurred “most probably” resulted from one specific cause rather than several potential causes. Parrillo v. F.W. Woolworth Co., 518 A.2d 354, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 567 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When expert medical testimony is offered to establish a causal relationship between a defendant’s act or omission and the plaintiff ’s injury, the testimony must speak in terms of “probabilities” rather than “possibilities”. Parrillo v. F.W. Woolworth Co., 518 A.2d 354, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 567 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was error to uphold doctor’s affidavit which attested to the cause and permanency of injury in a patient whom he had not treated in five and one-half years and whose medical file he apparently did not consult at the time he signed the affidavit. Picard v. Barry Pontiac-Buick, 654 A.2d 690, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 28 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Rules of Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The admission of the medical bills under Rule 803(6), Rules of Evidence, did not circumvent the requirement of this section, that medical affidavits purporting to establish proximate cause be supported by properly documented affidavits or by direct testimony of the physician rendering the opinion. Accordingly the trial justice did not err in admitting the bills under Rule 803(6) as evidence of the measure of damages claimed by the plaintiff. Ouellette v. Carde, 612 A.2d 687, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 169 (R.I. 1992).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Preconditions to the use of the res ipsa doctrine in any negligence action are: (1) the accident or injury must be of a kind which does not occur in the absence of someone’s negligence; (2) such accident or injury must be caused by an agency or instrumentality in the exclusive control of the defendant; and (3) it must not have been caused by any voluntary act or contribution on the part of the plaintiff. Marshall v. Tomaselli, 118 R.I. 190, 372 A.2d 1280, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1445 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Medical Malpractice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Res ipsa doctrine is inapplicable to medical malpractice actions unless the usual preconditions are met and the alleged negligent conduct lies within a layman’s common knowledge or there is expert testimony that the injury could have occurred only in the absence of the physician’s due care; and plaintiff could not invoke the doctrine in the case of a synovectomy, which lay outside common knowledge and upon which there was no expert testimony establishing a standard of care.

Section 9-19-34.1 was not a remedial statute, and the term “income disability act” meant an act that provided income to persons who were disabled; Medicaid did not fit this definition because many Medicaid recipients were not disabled, such as those who were aged 65 or older.

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is not superseded by Rule 702 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, as the two laws are complementary rather than contradictory to each other. Soares v. Vestal, 632 A.2d 647, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 229 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 9-19-41 and Rule 702 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, when construed both literally and liberally, intend to require only that a proffered expert possess adequate knowledge, skill, experience or education in the same field as the alleged malpractice. Debar v. Women &amp; Infants Hosp., 762 A.2d 1182, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 204 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The General Assembly has in this section, for medical malpractice cases, statutorily prescribed the requisite criteria for an expert witness but has not prescribed that he or she need be licensed in Rhode Island. Owens v. Payless Cashways, 670 A.2d 1240, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 27 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Qualifications.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To qualify as a expert witness, the testifying doctor need not be board certified or otherwise have had training or experience in the same medical specialty as the defendant-physician, provided the proposed expert otherwise has knowledge, skill, experience, or education in the same field as the alleged malpractice. Thus, a doctor skilled in pediatrics and family medicine, with experience in treating animal-bite wounds of the kind suffered by the plaintiff in the case at hand, did not need to be board certified in emergency or internal medicine to testify about the pertinent standard of care in treating such wounds and to opine whether the defendant-physician, who was so certified, met that standard. However relevant such matters may be to the weight given by the factfinder to the expert’s opinion, they should not bar such testimony ab initio. Marshall v. Medical Assocs., 677 A.2d 425, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 177 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is nothing in the plain and unambiguous language of this section that requires that before an expert testifies in a medical malpractice case, he or she must not only be an expert in the field where the alleged malpractice occurred, but must also practice in the same specialty as the defendant. This additional requirement is unnecessary and is in contravention to the General Assembly’s clear intent. Buja v. Morningstar, 688 A.2d 817, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 23 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The “same or similar communities” test is repudiated in favor of a national standard; thus, in an obstetrical malpractice action that involved a procedure and standard of care that has remained constant for over 30 years, a doctor who was board-certified in OB/GYN with over 30 years’ experience, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at a major New York hospital, and a member of the New York Statewide Professional Standards Review Council was qualified to testify regarding the appropriate standard of care. Sheeley v. Memorial Hosp., 710 A.2d 161, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 135 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In defining what constitutes the “field” of alleged malpractice, the state supreme court looks largely to the nature of the patient’s injury or to the nature of the procedure employed, rather than to rigid classifications based solely on specialty certification. Debar v. Women &amp; Infants Hosp., 762 A.2d 1182, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 204 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since it is appropriate in the right circumstances for a proposed expert witness formally trained in a different specialty other than that of the defendant to testify in the context of evaluating the appropriate standard of care in a given case, that same expert may testify regarding causation. Debar v. Women &amp; Infants Hosp., 762 A.2d 1182, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 204 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining if expert testimony about novel or technically complex theories or procedures possesses scientific validity, four non-exclusive factors are to be considered: (1) whether the proffered knowledge has been or can be tested; (2) whether the theory or technique has been the subject of peer review and publication; (3) whether there is a known or potential rate of error; and (4) whether the theory or technique has gained general acceptance in the scientific community. Owens v. Silvia, 838 A.2d 881, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 235 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court abused its discretion in determining that a patient’s expert doctor was not qualified to testify and render his opinions in the patient’s medical malpractice case where that trial court determined that the expert’s theory of negligence was not one shared by the individual doctor defendants and that the patient failed to introduce any evidence that would corroborate the scientific validity of the doctor’s causation conclusions. Owens v. Silvia, 838 A.2d 881, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 235 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Specific Cases.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court erred in excluding the testimony of plaintiff’s expert based upon his alleged inability to testify in regard to his knowledge of the standard of care in Rhode Island; the court should have considered the admissibility of the testimony in the light of this section and Rule 702 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Flanagan v. Wesselhoeft, 712 A.2d 365, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 174 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice erred when he arbitrarily concluded that a pediatric neurologist could not make a skillful interpretation of obstetrical data and only could speculate on matters related to causation, since the physician’s hands-on experience, coupled with his qualifications as a board-certified pediatrician and especially as a board-certified pediatric neurologist, qualified him to testify about the cause of the infant’s death. Debar v. Women &amp; Infants Hosp., 762 A.2d 1182, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 204 (R.I. 2000).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An admission of liability while still contesting damages is not a judgment by default or submission so as to invoke the provisions of this section. Blazar v. Perkins, 463 A.2d 203, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1047 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>At a hearing to determine damages the plaintiffs’ only burden was to prove the amount of damages they were entitled to recover from defaulted parties, and not the comparative negligence, if any, of settling defendants in relation to that of the defaulted defendants. Calise v. Hidden Valley Condo. Ass'n, 773 A.2d 834, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 160 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Comparative Negligence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because liability was not an issue at a hearing to determine damages, any comparative negligence of the plaintiff that would have reduced the damages to which the plaintiff was entitled could not be determined.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This is a procedural statute and consequently the 1958 amendment applies to existing actions. Pettis v. Henderson, 91 R.I. 191, 162 A.2d 540, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 81 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Intervention of Jury.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>At common law, the finding of a jury as to damages in defaulted cases was not a verdict but merely an inquest of office which the court could disregard at its discretion, and writ of inquiry of damages in defaulted cases was provided for in Rhode Island by statute of 1647 creating the “General Court of Tryalls.” Dyson v. Rhode Island Co., 25 R.I. 600, 57 A. 771, 1904 R.I. LEXIS 146 (1904).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was no statutory right to have damages in defaulted cases assessed by a jury at the time Constitution was adopted. Dyson v. Rhode Island Co., 25 R.I. 600, 57 A. 771, 1904 R.I. LEXIS 146 (1904).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This statute neither requires nor prohibits the court from calling a jury, and the court may exercise its discretion. Dyson v. Rhode Island Co., 25 R.I. 600, 57 A. 771, 1904 R.I. LEXIS 146 (1904).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court has inherent power to adopt the finding of the jury or to make a different assessment in a greater or lesser amount. Dyson v. Rhode Island Co., 25 R.I. 600, 57 A. 771, 1904 R.I. LEXIS 146 (1904).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section as amended in 1958 is mandatory and where there is nothing in the record to show why there was no intervention of a jury the assessment of damages by the trial justice was invalid. Pettis v. Henderson, 91 R.I. 191, 162 A.2d 540, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 81 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The amendments to this section have abrogated the decision in Pettis v. Henderson, 91 R.I. 191, 162 A.2d 540 (1960) to the extent that its holding gave defendants in default cases the right to a determination of damages by a jury. Marks v. D.A. Davis Constr. Corp., 536 A.2d 883, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 6 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The right to have a jury assess damages in a default case rests with the nondefaulting party. Marks v. D.A. Davis Constr. Corp., 536 A.2d 883, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 6 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The holding in Marks v. D.A. Davis Constr. Corp., 536 A.2d 883 (R.I. 1988) merely articulates the right to an assessment of damages that a nondefaulting party has against a party against whom judgment has been entered by default pursuant to this section. The holding in Marks does not sweep so broadly as to preclude a nondefaulting codefendant from requesting a jury trial on the issue of damages, even when the other codefendant has defaulted. Carlson v. Plouffe, 593 A.2d 74, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 128 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>New Trial.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In defaulted action, the question of whether damages as found by jury were excessive was not properly before the court on petition for new trial, where the court had neither approved nor disapproved such finding, as the act of the jury was not sufficient. Dyson v. Rhode Island Co., 25 R.I. 600, 57 A. 771, 1904 R.I. LEXIS 146 (1904).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In case of default or submission, judgment ensues at once and there is no longer any issue in the case which can be retried. Clewley v.

<p class="p7"><b>Punitive Damages.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Denial of plaintiff’s request for punitive damages was an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial justice where there was sufficient evidence of malice, wantonness and willfulness to support such an award. Sherman v. McDermott, 114 R.I. 107, 329 A.2d 195, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1068 (1974).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Comparative negligence does not serve as a bar to a plaintiff’s cause of action, since its net effect is to either to lessen a plaintiff’s recovery or to increase a defendant’s liability. Kay v. Menard, 754 A.2d 760, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 155 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state comparative negligence statute is not a comparative fault statute, and thus comes into play only after negligence is first established on the part of both the plaintiff and the defendant. Calise v. Hidden Valley Condo. Ass'n, 773 A.2d 834, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 160 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state’s comparative negligence statute does not address proportionate negligence between various defendants, but only permits comparison of either the negligence between a plaintiff and a defendant or, in the case of multiple defendants, the plaintiff and each particular defendant. Calise v. Hidden Valley Condo. Ass'n, 773 A.2d 834, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 160 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Assumption of Risk.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not affect the validity of assumption of the risk as a complete bar to recovery. Kennedy v. Providence Hockey Club, 119 R.I. 70, 376 A.2d 329, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1872 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Assumption of the risk which is concerned with knowingly encountering the danger contrasts with the former defense of contributory negligence which is concerned with negligently encountering the danger. Kennedy v. Providence Hockey Club, 119 R.I. 70, 376 A.2d 329, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1872 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although proof of a rear-end collision is prima facie evidence of negligence against the driver of the car in the rear and the burden of explaining by evidence then shifts to the defendant, the ultimate burden of proof in the case on all issues is still on the plaintiff. Galusha v. Carlson, 120 R.I. 204, 386 A.2d 634, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 652 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Contributory Negligence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not nullify the offsetting effect of a plaintiff’s contributory negligence, it merely alters the manner in which the negligence of the parties is taken into account. Raymond v. Jenard, 120 R.I. 634, 390 A.2d 358, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 712 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Nonnegligence Actions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section applies to cases brought for breach of implied warranty only if the damages sought are for personal injuries sustained. If the action is brought for damage to the product itself, this section does not apply. Fiske v. MacGregor, 464 A.2d 719, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1028 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Comparative-negligence principles apply to actions brought on theories of strict liability and breach of implied warranty, as well as actions brought on a negligence theory. Fiske v. MacGregor, 464 A.2d 719, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1028 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The jury, in a strict-liability action or an implied-warranty action, may consider a plaintiff’s negligent encounter with danger if it decides that the plaintiff’s conduct does not reach that level of culpability that amounts to a knowing encounter with danger, that is, assumption of the risk. The damages should then be reduced by the percent the plaintiff is found to have been negligent. Fiske v. MacGregor, 464 A.2d 719, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1028 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions of this section apply to actions for personal injuries resulting from breach of warranty. Lariviere v. Dayton Safety Ladder Co., 525 A.2d 892, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 481 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Misrepresentation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is not applicable to cases that involve pecuniary damages to an aggrieved party resulting from misrepresentation. Estate of Braswell v. People's Credit Union, 602 A.2d 510, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 11 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Out-Of-State Injury.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was error for the trial justice to apply the state’s “pure” comparative negligence statute in a case in which the injury and the conduct allegedly causing the injury occurred in Massachusetts, since the defendant’s headquarters and place of business at issue were in that state and the parties might reasonably have expected Massachusetts law to apply. Najarian v. Nat'l Amusements, Inc., 768 A.2d 1253, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 93 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Rescue Doctrine.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The rescue doctrine survives the adoption of the comparative-negligence statute and the principles of comparative negligence apply only if a defendant establishes that the rescuer’s actions were rash or reckless. Ouellette v. Carde, 612 A.2d 687, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 169 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Retroactive Application.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that the language of this section was specifically changed from “in any action accruing on and after July 1, 1971, . . .” to “[i]n all actions hereafter brought, . . .” firmly establishes the intent of the legislature that the section apply retroactively. Raymond v. Jenard, 120 R.I. 634, 390 A.2d 358, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 712 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Two major factors to be weighed in determining the validity of a retroactive statute are the strength of the public interest it serves and the unfairness created by its retroactive operation, and the reliance of the parties on preexisting law is perhaps the most accurate gauge of the latter. Raymond v. Jenard, 120 R.I. 634, 390 A.2d 358, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 712 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The test of unfairness as to retroactive application of a statute is not whether formerly impossible recovery is now possible, but whether “settled expectations honestly arrived at with respect to substantial interests” are being defeated. Raymond v. Jenard, 120 R.I. 634, 390 A.2d 358, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 712 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Abrogation of a defendant’s right to rely on the preexisting rule (of contributory negligence) by retroactive application of this section (providing for comparative negligence) was not inequitable, as the public interest served thereby far outweighs the minimal harshness caused by the retroactive application. Raymond v. Jenard, 120 R.I. 634, 390 A.2d 358, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 712 (1978).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the trial court’s decision is correct, it is not germane that the conclusion was reached through faulty reasoning or a mistake of law, and it is well settled that an order or judgment that is correct notwithstanding the erroneous reasoning upon which it rests will be sustained. Souza v. O'Hara, 121 R.I. 88, 395 A.2d 1060, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 763 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a purchaser at a mortgage foreclosure sale was entitled to notice of a subsequent tax sale because at the time of the tax sale, the controlling statute, former R.I.

Laws ch. 140, § 1, was not retroactively controlling in the instant appeal, the purchaser was bound by the previous mandates governing foreclosure petitions; R.I. Gen. Laws § 44-9-31 explicitly provided that the failure to raise any question concerning the validity of a tax title on or before the return day would result in the party’s being forever barred from contesting or raising the question in any other proceeding, and therefore the judgment entered upon the tax foreclosure petition was not void, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-21-2(a)(4). Kildeer Realty v. Brewster Realty Corp., 826 A.2d 961, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 173 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Adoption Proceedings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a final decree of adoption is sought to be set aside on grounds of undue influence, a finding of undue influence is warranted only where the evidence shows that the influence was exerted to such a degree as to amount to force or coercion, destroying the free agency of the natural parent whose consent was secured, and it is not required that the consent of a natural parent to surrender her child be given free from the emotions, tensions and pressures inherent in the situation.

<p class="p7"><b>Consent Decrees.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A consent decree is final and binding so that it cannot be vacated, modified, negated, amended and/or affected without the mutual consent of the parties thereto and/or those affected thereby. Although a party may have second thoughts following a later court decision in another case, a party may not unilaterally walk away from its obligations thereunder. Mansolillo v.

<p class="p7"><b>Correcting Record.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Date From Which Period Runs.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The six-month period of this section prior to the 1965 amendment did not run from date of original entry of default but from the date of final entry of judgment.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant who answered but who failed to appear on day for hearing on motion for summary judgment or to offer any defense was in default. Dimond v. Marwell, 57 R.I. 477, 190 A. 683, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 122 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the absence of an affidavit of defense at the time the trial justice passed on defendant’s motion to have default removed, the justice erred in granting such motion.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant seeks to set aside default judgment it is not enough to merely state that he can offer a meritorious defense to the action but he must show a prima facie defense. Pettis v. Henderson, 91 R.I. 191, 162 A.2d 540, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 81 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A motion to vacate a judgment by default is addressed to the judicial discretion of the court which entered the judgment in the first instance and upon review the Supreme Court will not set aside the action of an inferior court upon such a motion unless it appears that there has been an abuse of discretion or that the decision is based upon an error of law.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a foreclosure sale, where the buyer’s counsel engaged in a direct phone call with one of the owners who was represented by counsel, the buyer’s counsel violated R.I. Sup. Ct. art.

Gen. Laws § 9-21-2(a). Pleasant Mgmt., LLC v. Carrasco, 870 A.2d 443, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 61 (R.I. 2005).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Expert Witnesses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Costs are normally considered the expenses of suing another party, including filing fees and fees to serve process. Fees to pay expert witnesses would not be included in this definition of costs. Moreover, where the trial justice never directly ruled on the plaintiffs’ motion for award of costs, it could be inferred that the justice did not intend to exercise the discretion granted to her by this section and have her award of costs include fees for expert witnesses.

<p class="p7"><b>Illustrative Cases.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering both the State and defendants to pay their own costs, as it found that 1) the State’s claim was not frivolous or made in bad faith; 2) the public had a heightened interest because of the physical and environmental problems at issue; 3) assigning all costs to the State could act could deter future environmental suits; and 4) both the public and defendants substantially benefited from the litigation.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a property owners’ suit to enjoin the city’s abandonment of streets and alleys, an order denying defendant’s motion to strike plaintiffs’ motion for a jury trial and assigning the case to determine whether the issues to be framed by plaintiffs were appropriate for jury trial, was not an interlocutory order or decree appealable under this section. Corrado v. City of Providence, 114 R.I. 691, 337 A.2d 811, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1472 (1975).</p>

Fayle v. Traudt, 813 A.2d 58, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 7 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Summary judgment order is not one of the four specific types of appealable interlocutory orders listed in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-24-7. Furtado v. Laferriere, 839 A.2d 533, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 7 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a personal injury case, an appeal from the denial of a motion to amend a complaint was not entertained on appeal because it did not fall within one of the statutory exceptions to the final judgment rule; the order did not grant or continue an injunction, appoint a receiver, order the sale of real or personal property, or order or deny a new trial after a jury trial. Moreover, the order did not appear likely to cause consequences that were imminent or that would have caused irreparable damage. Cayer v. Cox R.I. Telecom, LLC, 85 A.3d 1140, 2014 R.I.

<p class="p7"><b>Divorce Proceedings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The rule in McAuslan v. McAuslan, 34 R.I. 462, 83 A. 837 (1912), that the court will review a decree which, although in a strict sense interlocutory, has such an element of finality that the court will act before the case has finally terminated in order to prevent the possible injurious consequences, was not applied in divorce proceedings because of the evils that accompany piecemeal review of interlocutory orders entered in the course of those proceedings. Berberian v. Berberian, 109 R.I. 273, 284 A.2d 72, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1053 (1971).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the way to obtain review of an order granting a preliminary injunction entered in the superior court was by appeal within twenty days following entry, where third party defendants in a divorce action filed a petition for certiorari to obtain such a review, the petition was read as if it were a claim of appeal since it was claimed within the twenty day time limit. Johnson v. Johnson, 111 R.I. 46, 298 A.2d 795, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1177 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A decree ordering receivers and commissioners to appoint two appraisers for property involved in a divorce action was not reviewable. Cavanagh v. Cavanagh, 118 R.I. 608, 375 A.2d 911 (1977), but Family Court was without authority to order partition and sale of property while appeal was pending in Supreme Court. Cavanagh v.

<p class="p7"><b>Finality of Proceeding.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ordinarily, the interlocutory nature of an action below, without more, would prevent the Supreme Court from considering an appeal. An exception, judicial in origin, permits a review of a decree which, although in a strict sense interlocutory, has such an element of finality that the court will act before the case has finally terminated in order to prevent possible injurious consequences. Review in the latter situation, however, is by way of a discretionary writ of certiorari. In re Joseph J., 465 A.2d 150, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1072 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a child’s foster parents bring an action in the family court seeking injunctive relief to prevent the department of children and their families from reuniting the child with his natural mother until there can be a hearing on their petition for adoption and the court determines that the foster parents lack standing and denies them relief, and the foster parents file an appeal, the Supreme Court will depart from its usual procedure and consider the appeal as a petition for certiorari in order to address the merits of the case, as the action of the court below has an element of finality. In re Joseph J., 465 A.2d 150, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1072 (R.I. 1983).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Heir’s appeal of a partition order was not reviewable because the order did not fall within the statutory exception permitting appeals from interlocutory orders where it did not terminate the litigation, the parties’ respective interests had not yet been determined, claims remained outstanding, the order authorized the sale of the property, but did not actually order the sale, and the order not only continued a hearing on a motion to sell, but also invited offers to buy the property. Baker v. Mitchell, 79 A.3d 844, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 144 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court’s order adopting the master’s report and implementing the master’s findings was not properly before the supreme court because the order was interlocutory; the order was not final but was merely an order confirming the master’s report and did not set forth the ultimate resolution of the parties’ disputes. Coit v. Tillinghast, 91 A.3d 838, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 81 (R.I. 2014).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An appeal from the grant of a preliminary injunction to enjoin utilization of self help in eviction proceedings was dismissed on appeal without prejudice as moot, since plaintiff had vacated the premises shortly after the entry of the preliminary injunction.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a preliminary injunction issued pursuant to Rule RCP 65 is appealable under this section; because it is appealable, such a preliminary injunction constitutes a judgment under Rule RCP 45, which defines “judgment” to include “any order from which an appeal lies”; and Rule RCP 58 requires that all judgments “be set forth on a separate document,” quite clearly a written preliminary injunction is contemplated by the rules and statutes as controlling over an oral injunctive order for purposes of assessment of conduct which is allegedly contumacious in violation of a preliminary injunction.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supreme court would not on appeal determine a question on which there was no real controversy between the parties and which could have been certified under this section. DiPrete v. Vallone, 70 R.I. 286, 38 A.2d 769, 1944 R.I. LEXIS 58 (1944).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Constitutionality could not be considered on an appeal based on the ground that verdict was against the law, since constitutionality must be specially pleaded and certified to supreme court for decision. State v. Smith, 35 R.I. 282, 86 A. 890, 1913 R.I. LEXIS 32 (1913) (decided under former § 12-22-10).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Attorney-General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section the attorney-general may obtain the certification of questions of such pressing public interest and importance that they should be decided without the necessity of awaiting the outcome of pending litigation, for the supreme court’s determination, in which case the court would have the benefit of briefs and arguments by adversary counsel and its determination would not be a mere advisory opinion, but a binding decision having the force and effect of law. Opinion to Governor, 88 R.I. 392, 149 A.2d 341, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 24 (1959); Opinion to House of Representatives, 88 R.I. 396, 149 A.2d 343, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 25 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Certification Pre-Empted.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the questions certified under this section were resolved by a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in other cases before the certified questions could be considered by the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, the court declined to answer the questions and remitted the case to the superior court for reconsideration on the basis of the United States Supreme Court decisions. State v. MacTavish, 106 R.I. 630, 262 A.2d 383, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 965 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Consideration by Trial Court.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Certification may be made only if after careful consideration, assisted by argument and briefs of counsel, the trial justice is still unable to decide the question. Tillinghast v. Johnson, 34 R.I. 136, 82 A. 788, 1912 R.I. LEXIS 34 (1912); Murray v. Taylor, 43 R.I. 5, 109 A. 565, 1920 R.I. LEXIS 22 (1920); Easton v. Fessenden, 63 R.I. 11, 6 A.2d 714, 1939 R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where certification pursuant to this section appeared to be motivated by a desire of the parties to reach promptly a final decision by the supreme court rather than by the inability of the trial court to resolve a legal question, the supreme court declined response to the certified questions and remanded the case. Richardson v. Bevilacqua, 115 R.I. 49, 340 A.2d 118, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1117 (1975).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although, under § 9-24-25, when the parties in an action have filed an agreed statement of facts the District or Superior Court is required to certify the question to the Supreme Court, certified questions should not be used as a means of short-circuiting the proper procedure for resolving matters in controversy, especially when the question is not so obscure or enigmatic as to preclude its successful resolution by the trial justice. Employers Mut. Casualty Co. v. Martin, 671 A.2d 798, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Consideration Without Regard to Facts.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supreme court would not consider constitutional question on all possible set facts but only as such question was presented on the record. State v. Smith, 56 R.I. 168, 184 A. 494, 1936 R.I. LEXIS 90 (1936).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In considering constitutional question supreme court was not concerned with issues of fact but only with the question as certified and as germane to the real issues. Creditors' Serv. Corp. v. Cummings, 57 R.I. 291, 190 A. 2, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 101 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In considering doubtful questions certified under this section, the supreme court must pass only upon the questions presented without reference to the circumstances out of which the case arose.

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutional Questions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Bringing on the Record.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Certification should not be made of a constitutional question until it has been brought formally upon the record. Carroll v. Chrupcala, 53 R.I. 11, 162 A. 852, 1932 R.I. LEXIS 100 (1932).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant in criminal case could not, under prior law (G.L. 1938, ch. 545, § 1), raise constitutional question by motion to certify such question, after he had pleaded to the complaint, without having first raised the question in some formal pleading. State v. Hartman, 65 R.I. 174, 14 A.2d 18, 1940 R.I. LEXIS 97 (1940).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court will not pass upon the constitutionality of an act of the general assembly unless the matter is brought in question upon the record with clarity and particularity. Ravenelle v. Woonsocket, 73 R.I. 270, 54 A.2d 376, 1947 R.I. LEXIS 69 (1947).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A notation appearing on the face of the complaint that the district court refused “to certify to supreme court the motion of defendant to have act declared unconstitutional” standing alone is obviously inadequate to raise on the record a specific constitutional question in the courts of this state. Mailey v. Estate of De Pasquale, 94 R.I. 31, 177 A.2d 376, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 22 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To raise a constitutional question within the purview of the certification statutes the question must be raised on the record with clarity and particularity and cannot be raised off the record in an informal manner. Mailey v. Estate of De Pasquale, 94 R.I. 31, 177 A.2d 376, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 22 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ordinarily to raise a constitutional question, such question is required to be raised upon the record through a formal demurrer, plea in abatement, or a motion to quash the complaint. Mailey v. Estate of De Pasquale, 94 R.I. 31, 177 A.2d 376, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 22 (1962) (decided under former § 12-22-10).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Constitutional questions must be raised on the record with particularity and clarity in order to be certified to the supreme court for decision. State ex rel. Widergren v. Charette, 110 R.I. 124, 290 A.2d 858, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 888 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Case Determinable on Other Issues.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supreme court would not consider a certified question as to the constitutionality of a statute conferring power to pass regulations until the trial court had determined whether the particular regulation involved was authorized by the terms of the statute. State v. Goldberg, 61 R.I. 461, 1 A.2d 101, 1938 R.I. LEXIS 81 (1938).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supreme court would not determine a constitutional question where such determination would not settle the case and where other issues might determine the case without the necessity of relying on the constitutional question. Lonsdale Co. v. Providence, 63 R.I. 28, 7 A.2d 201, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 63 (1939).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Constitutionality of an ordinance would not be determined until it was determined that such ordinance fell within the terms of the enabling statute. Victory Land Co. v. Halliday, 65 R.I. 143, 13 A.2d 808, 1940 R.I. LEXIS 91 (1940).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Certiorari.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Certiorari was granted to bring up a constitutional question in a case where it was contended that the repeal of the prior law (G.L. 1938, ch. 545, § 1) for the mandatory certification of constitutional questions was itself unconstitutional. State v. Fay, 65 R.I. 304, 14 A.2d 799, 1940 R.I. LEXIS 126 (1940).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the attorney-general opposes certiorari to compel the certification of a constitutional question, criminal defendants may not urge in support of certiorari that public policy requires certification in order to save the state needless trial expense.

<p class="p7"><b>— Decision by Trial Court.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By the 1940 amendment of this section and repeal of G.L. 1938, ch. 545, § 1, the supreme court was deprived of exclusive original jurisdiction of constitutional questions and the superior court was empowered, even in civil cases, to make initial determinations on constitutional questions. Allen v. Rhode Island State Bd. of Veterinarians, 72 R.I. 372, 52 A.2d 131, 1947 R.I. LEXIS 19 (1947).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under prior law (G.L. 1938, ch. 545, § 1) when constitutionality of any statute was questioned by the pleadings, the superior court had no discretion but to certify the question and the supreme court would determine whether it could properly consider the question. Brosco v. Frost, 63 R.I. 1, 6 A.2d 705, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 52 (1939).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the trial court, acting under its discretionary powers, denies a motion to certify a constitutional question for immediate determination, such question is automatically raised if bill of exceptions or appeal is later taken to the supreme court.

<p class="p7"><b>— Effect on Defendants’ Constitutional Rights.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute under the certification statute unless it directly and adversely impinges upon some constitutionally protected right of the defendant, nor will it pass upon the constitutionality of a statute in cases where, if the statute were found to be unconstitutional, the defendant would gain nothing thereby. State ex rel. Widergren v. Charette, 110 R.I. 124, 290 A.2d 858, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 888 (1972).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under prior law (G.L. 1938, ch. 545, § 1) supreme court would consider constitutional questions as reframed by trial court where the party raising the questions did not object.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Before certifying a question involving a town ordinance to the supreme court under this section, a lower court must first determine that the town council has authority from the general assembly to legislate on the matter addressed in the ordinance.

<p class="p7"><b>— Sufficiency of Proceedings.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no provision in the general laws authorizing a probate court to certify any doubtful question of law to the supreme court for determination. In re Rathbun, 43 R.I. 173, 110 A. 649, 1920 R.I. LEXIS 62 (1920).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 8-10-43 makes this section applicable to the family court, at least when exercising juvenile jurisdiction. In re Correia, 104 R.I. 251, 243 A.2d 759, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 641 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mere reluctance of trial justice to resolve a question does not warrant certification but if he entertains a serious doubt as to how an issue should be resolved he may invoke statutes such as § 12-22-10 (since repealed) and this section and certify question to the supreme court only when he is unable to reach a satisfactory conclusion after careful consideration aided by the research and arguments of counsel. State v. Walsh, 108 R.I. 518, 277 A.2d 298, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1299 (1971); State ex rel. Widergren v. Charette, 110 R.I. 124, 290 A.2d 858, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 888 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 8-10-43 authorizes Family Court justices, like their Superior and District Court counterparts, to certify questions to the state Supreme Court where those questions so affect the merits of the controversy that they ought to be determined by that court prior to further proceedings. Rubano v. DiCenzo, 759 A.2d 959, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 182 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Decision by Trial Court.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Certified question was refused where trial court had already made a decision on the doubtful question and where the moving party could have prosecuted an immediate bill of exceptions. Broad St. Motors v. Mathews, 55 R.I. 502, 183 A. 142, 1936 R.I. LEXIS 6 (1936).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Question which had been decided by district court judge could not be certified. Brady v. Moreau, 65 R.I. 469, 16 A.2d 329, 1940 R.I. LEXIS 137 (1940).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By ruling on the merits of defendant’s motion to dismiss any information on grounds that section under which he was charged was vague, the trial justice precluded determination of the same issue pursuant to this section. State v. Phillips, 430 A.2d 1061, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1171 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Declaratory Judgment Proceedings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although this section may have been intended to be limited to those proceedings in which a trial on the merits is inherent and not apply to declaratory judgment proceedings, where superior court, of its own volition, certified question of meaning of former § 13-2-44 in declaratory judgment proceeding in which the liberty or unlawful detention of plaintiff was basic issue, the supreme court was disposed to answer the question. Rondoni v. Sherman, 90 R.I. 322, 158 A.2d 267, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 26 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the supreme court might consider questions which involve grave questions of public concern the legislature did not intend to permit a combining of petitions under the Declaratory Judgment Act with certification under this section, and, therefore, the court declares that they will not hereafter entertain certification of questions under this section in proceedings commenced under the Declaratory Judgment Act. Sweeney v. Notte, 95 R.I. 68, 183 A.2d 296, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 880 (1969).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Dependence on Questions of Fact.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the trial court framed a question as based on a hypothetical set of facts and there was evidence tending to prove such facts, the supreme court considered such question. Prescott v. Kelley, 52 R.I. 45, 157 A. 198, 1931 R.I. LEXIS 101 (1931).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Doubt and Importance.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A motion in the superior court to dismiss for want of jurisdiction did not present a question of such doubt and importance as to require certification under this section. Poirier v. Quinn, 83 R.I. 98, 113 A.2d 642, 1955 R.I. LEXIS 20 (1955).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Effect on Merits.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supreme court would not decide a question as to the power of the superior court to approve a compromise on behalf of an infant since such question did not affect the merits of the controversy but rather involved the propriety of a disposition which would render the merits of no consequence. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Co. v. Davis, 68 R.I. 461, 29 A.2d 647, 1942 R.I. LEXIS 95 (1942).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Form of Certification.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supreme court would determine question involved, though question was not stated in certificate, where it was reasonably clear what question was involved, but without any intention to set a precedent. United States Trust Co. v. Tax Assessors, 47 R.I. 420, 133 A. 802, 1926 R.I. LEXIS 75 (1926).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court accepted certification for hearing and determination on an agreed statement of facts under § 9-24-25 as moved in the lower court, although the case arrived under a consent order which certified three stated questions under this section, because of the extreme public interest, but stated that the failure to reject the improper certification was not precedential. North Kingstown v. North Kingstown Teachers Ass'n, 110 R.I. 698, 297 A.2d 342, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 969 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Improper Certification.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant’s exception to the trial court’s charge prescribed for supreme court’s consideration the very question of constitutionality of § 12-17-14, to which he sought answer, the question was improperly certified as a question of importance under this section. State v. Walsh, 108 R.I. 518, 277 A.2d 298, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1299 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although certification was not the proper means to raise the question, since violation of a basic constitutional right was alleged, the court on appeal considered the question, rather than have defendant return to the court by the circuitous route of post-conviction relief. State v. Walsh, 113 R.I. 118, 318 A.2d 463, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1146 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A hearing justice who granted an order for certification of questions of law to the Supreme Court and then stayed all further agency and court proceedings pending determination of the certified questions erred when he had no final agency decision or order before him that he could act upon and stay, and no proposed certified questions before him. Bayview Towing v. Stevenson, 676 A.2d 325, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 139 (R.I. 1996), overruled in part, Rivera v. Employees' Ret. Sys. of R.I., 70 A.3d 905, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 47 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Merits of Controversy.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Question as to exemption of attached wages did not bear on the principal controversy, so cannot be certified. Brady v. Moreau, 65 R.I. 469, 16 A.2d 329, 1940 R.I. LEXIS 137 (1940).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Other Remedies Available.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court did not abuse discretion in refusing to certify a constitutional question where the question could be saved by exception or by reservation under former § 12-22-10. State v. Paradis, 66 R.I. 152, 18 A.2d 342, 1941 R.I. LEXIS 20 (1941).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Premature Certification.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the only relief yet sought from the superior court was the issuance of an injunction, the supreme court would not determine whether a particular practice would be in violation of the injunction. Garabedian v. Fraser, 137 A. 219, 1927 R.I. LEXIS 95 (R.I. 1927).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Questions should not be certified before careful consideration is given to whether they are really as perplexing as they might at first seem since, when faced with a certified question, the supreme court is deprived of the considerable benefit of a more complete record and of the trial justice’s decision and its rationale prior to review. State v. Carcieri, 730 A.2d 11, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 111 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Question Before Court.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Certification may not be made of question that may arise in future proceedings in the case but only of a question that has already been raised.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A justice of a superior or district court cannot certify a question of law to the supreme court as one of doubt and importance, when, at time of certification, there is nothing before the justice other than a motion to certify by the attorney general. State v. Weiner, 97 R.I. 506, 199 A.2d 120, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 112 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section as amended in 1965 was not intended to be used as a substitute for a bill of exceptions which is available to a litigant and would bring before the court the identical issue embodied in the certified question.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice committed clear error by <i>sua sponte </i>dismissing a criminal information against defendant charging her with cruelty to or neglect of a child as defendant did not file a motion to dismiss, and the Family Court failed to follow the procedural rules applicable to dismissals.

<p class="p7"><b>Due Process.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The procedures undertaken by the plaintiff, such as seeking to enforce by writ of execution terms and provisions of foreign default judgment, afforded the defendants more than adequate due process. Pezzello Bros. Fruit &amp; Produce Co. v. Armenakes, 677 A.2d 907, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 181 (R.I. 1996).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plaintiffs and their constable were under no legal obligation to give advance warning and notice of an execution and levy upon the defendants’ automobile, since their procedure was pursuant to execution-levy of this chapter and not by writ of attachment (chapter 5 of title 10). Had they given advance warning and notice, the automobile would most probably have disappeared from the constable’s view. What was important was that the defendants did in fact, after the levy, receive timely notice of the levy and the intended execution sale. Pezzello Bros. Fruit &amp; Produce Co. v. Armenakes, 677 A.2d 907, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 181 (R.I. 1996).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “trustee” as used in the various provisions of the statutes relating to trustee process, manifestly denotes the debtor or agent of the principal defendant, i.e., the person against whom the action ex contractu at law only might be maintained in favor of the principal defendant, and is not used in its technical sense. Cross v. Brown, 19 R.I. 220, 33 A. 147, 1895 R.I. LEXIS 71 (1895), aff'd, 175 U.S. 396, 20 S. Ct. 131, 44 L. Ed. 211, 1899 U.S. LEXIS 1573 (1899).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the statute, when an alias or pluries execution is wanted, the practice has been for the clerk to issue it, if the prior execution appears by the return to be unsatisfied, or if this does not appear, the practice has been for the court to execute the new execution on motion without notice.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court refused to apply the one-year limitation applicable to motions pursuant to Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 60(b) to independent actions seeking relief from judgment, since this section gives successful litigants six years in which to seek an execution order and to hold that an independent action brought by the losing party must be brought within one year would be to deprive litigants of the right to challenge judgments for which execution has issued beyond that one year.

The estate of homestead provided pursuant to this section shall be automatic by operation of law, and without any requirement or necessity for the filing of a declaration, a statement in a deed, or any other documentation.

Gen. Laws § 33-12-6, did not keep title from vesting. In re Tetreault, 11 A.3d 635, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 4 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a bankruptcy debtor’s mother generally devised certain real property to the debtor, in common with the debtor’s sister, in the residuary clause of the mother’s will, the debtor could claim a homestead exemption as to the debtor’s interest in the property because a reference to “family” in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-26-4.1(b) did not bar the debtor from claiming the exemption as (1) the debtor was an “owner of a home” for purposes of the statute, (2) the statute was ambiguous as to the term “family,” and the general assembly did not intend to bar the eligibility of a tenant in common living alone, (3) the statute was intended to benefit tenants in common, and (4) § 9-26-4.1(b) only limited the exemption to one per family. In re Tetreault, 11 A.3d 635, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 4 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Chapter 7 debtor was permitted to avoid 3 judicial liens on property, even though the motions did not comply with a local state bankruptcy rule relating to the avoidance of liens and the calculations did not conform to a federal statute relating to avoidance of liens because, after the bankruptcy court applied correct formula, an exemption impairment amount was greater than liens. The debtor was entitled to an exemption of up to $500,000 in homestead property under state law. In re Derocha, 503 B.R. 553, 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 126 (Bankr. D.R.I. 2014).</p>

Gen. Laws § 9-26-4.1. Although the debtor used the property to operate an auto repair business and as his residence, Rhode Island’s homestead exemption statute allowed homeowners to claim a homestead exemption in mixed-use property that was their primary residence, and the homeowner had obtained permission from the City of Cranston, Rhode Island, to reside on the property and was using the majority of the property for residential purposes at the time he declared bankruptcy.

The debtor had not lived within the state where the residence was located for several years and by moving into the residence, his commute to work was increased by two hours per day; further, there was no evidence that the co-owner consented to the debtor’s occupancy or that the co-owner would not force partition and sale.

Laws § 9-26-4.1(a) because he did not occupy the property, which was his former marital domicile, there was no evidence that he intended to occupy the property in the future as a primary residence, the fact that his minor daughter occupied the property was not relevant to the validity of the exemption, and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, § 1, which required a writing to create and terminate a homestead exemption, was not similar to R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-26-4.1(a). In re Sacharko, 345 B.R. 474, 2006 Bankr.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A family loses its ability to spend a portion of its income when that income is deferred and placed in a pension. It would be terribly unfair to read an exemption statute, which was created to protect a pension for the benefit of a retired employee’s family, in such a way that the exemption would bar children or a former spouse from receiving support from the very fund created for their benefit, and would once again deny them the benefits of the income they sacrificed to a pension years before.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial master erred by considering the spouse’s disability pension from a city a marital asset and, therefore, erred by awarding the wife 65% of the monthly benefits, as the husband’s firemen’s disability pension was statutorily exempt under this section.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions of this section cannot operate to preclude a police officer’s pension from being considered a marital asset for purposes of property division upon divorce; the pension is analogous in form to a forced savings account to which the employee and his family deferred compensation for the purpose of their future financial security, and it is therefore considered marital property subject to division along with the employee’s other assets. The same rationale applies with respect to firefighters’ pensions. Duke v. Duke, 675 A.2d 822, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 145 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section did not preclude the court from awarding to wife an interest in the retirement portion of her husband’s disability pension because the antiattachment statute is designed to protect pension funds from creditors and not from the families of employees.

If no such address shall be set forth in the mortgage, attachment, lien, or other encumbrance or if the instrument shall not have been recorded more than thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled sale date, without reference to any adjournment, continuation, or postponement of the sale, no such notice need be mailed to the holder of any such mortgage, attachment, lien, or other encumbrance.

If a notice is not given prior to the sale to all persons who have recorded a mortgage, attachment, lien, or any other encumbrance relating to the levied premises, which is junior or subordinate to the execution, the encumbrance shall survive the sale for a period of one year from the date of sale unless a written notice of commencement of foreclosure proceedings of the mortgage or a written notice of intent to enforce the attachment, lien, or other encumbrance is recorded in the land evidence records in the city or town where the levied premises are located. Failure to record written notice within one year of the sale shall render the mortgage, attachment, lien, or other encumbrance, which is junior or subordinate to the execution, unenforceable. If no person redeem the real estate or interest therein before the real estate shall be exposed for sale, which sale shall not be earlier than three (3) months after levy, the officer shall sell the real estate, or so much thereof as shall be sufficient to satisfy the judgment obtained and the costs and charges, at public auction, and a deed thereof, by him or her given, shall vest in the purchaser all the estate, right, and interest which the debtor had therein at the time the estate was attached, or in case there was no attachment, all the estate, right, and interest which the debtor had at the time the levy was made, and the surplus of money that shall arise from the sale of the real estate or interest therein after satisfying the execution and the costs and charges shall be deposited with the general treasurer for the owner thereof, and shall be liable to be attached for his or her other debts.</p>

A party who is not represented by an attorney shall sign his or her pleading, motion, or other paper and state his or her address and telephone number. Except when otherwise specifically provided by rule or statute, pleadings need not be verified or accompanied by affidavit. The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by him or her that he or she has read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. If a pleading, motion, or other paper is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the pleader or movant. If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, may impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other paper, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Contracts.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The settlement agreement reached by injured party with another insurer which, should a judgment be obtained and remain unsatisfied, would be the basis of possible liability of insurance company not a party to the action in which settlement agreement was reached, is just such a document or writing in the nature of a contract as is expressly included in this section, the production of which could be required. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Nastari, 94 R.I. 55, 177 A.2d 778, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 18 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a contract for sale of realty was made subject to a zoning change and the town council denied the petition for change, appeal of which was pending in superior court, the declaratory judgment construing the contract as terminated by the denial by the town council of the zoning petition was properly granted. Theroux v. Bay Assocs., 114 R.I. 746, 339 A.2d 266, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1483 (1975).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Insurer was entitled to declaratory relief where insured’s delay in notifying insurer of claim prejudiced insurer’s ability to investigate medical support for claim, and insurer had in effect lost its subrogation rights due to the delay. Pennsylvania General Ins. Co. v. Becton, 475 A.2d 1032, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 509 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since prior case law had already determined that public policy concerns did not preclude enforcement of a Massachusetts auto insurance policy limiting liability coverage to accidents that occurred in Massachusetts, a trial court should have granted an auto insurer’s motion for summary judgment declaring that the insurer did not have to provide coverage for an accident that occurred in Rhode Island; Rhode Island’s own compulsory coverage provisions applied only to cars registered in Rhode Island.

<p class="p7"><b>Disability Determinations.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although § 42-28-21 does not provide any specific method of review of a determination by the superintendent of state police in respect to a disability pension, except that such determination shall be confirmed by the governor, the Superior Court has original jurisdiction to construe the rights and responsibilities of any party arising from a statute, pursuant to the powers conferred by this section. Canario v. Culhane, 752 A.2d 476, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 130 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Effect of Release.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Hearing justice erred in dismissing the former employer’s declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that a release by the employee arising out of the settlement of a workers’ compensation claim released the employer from the employee’s claims before the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights for disability discrimination. Family Dollar Stores of R.I., Inc. v. Araujo, 204 A.3d 1089, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 51 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, § 9-30-1 et seq., clearly allows the holder of a release document to seek from the superior court a declaration as to the validity and enforceability of the release; prompt and definitive resolution of release-related issues is one of the many salutary efficiencies made possible by the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. Family Dollar Stores of R.I., Inc. v. Araujo, 204 A.3d 1089, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 51 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Election of remedies doctrine was inapplicable because it mattered not that a former employer opted not to have the discrimination case removed to superior court under § 28-5-24.1 as the employer did not commence the litigation before the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights and thus did not affirmatively elect any remedy; consequently, the employer was entitled to have the question of the validity and enforceability of the contractual settlement agreement passed upon by the courts. Family Dollar Stores of R.I., Inc. v. Araujo, 204 A.3d 1089, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 51 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies was inapplicable because the case did not involve a situation where a party was aggrieved by a decision of an agency and must exhaust all avenues of review within that agency before proceeding to court, but rather, the case involved a purely contractual issue. The validity and applicability of a release is a legal question, unquestionably within the jurisdiction and purview of the superior court. Family Dollar Stores of R.I., Inc. v. Araujo, 204 A.3d 1089, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 51 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former employer’s declaratory judgment action with respect to the validity and enforceability of a release could proceed in superior court; it had not been established beyond a reasonable doubt that the employer would not be entitled to relief, and the former employee did not show beyond a reasonable doubt that the declaration requested was an impossibility. Family Dollar Stores of R.I., Inc. v. Araujo, 204 A.3d 1089, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 51 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Intent of Parties.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction Notwithstanding Political Question.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court had jurisdiction under chapter 30 of title 9 and § 8-2-13 to determine whether the governor had complied with the mandate of § 17-7-1 despite the underlying political nature of the issues.

<p class="p7"><b>No Subject Matter Jurisdiction Under This Section.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As a city retirement board’s petition seeking to confirm its decision to reduce a former city employee’s pension was brought under an ordinance providing for the reduction of pensions of city employees convicted of charges stemming from their employment, the matter did not properly invoke either the equity or the declaratory judgment jurisdiction of the superior court.

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the trial judge granted a Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss a declaratory judgment action, exercising his discretion under this section to hold that the matter was not ripe for determination, the Supreme Court reversed the 12(b)(6) dismissal, not on grounds that related to this section, but because the trial judge failed to apply the proper test under 12(b)(6), that is, whether it was clear beyond a reasonable doubt that plaintiff was not entitled to relief under any set of facts that might be proved. Redmond v. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Nat'l Bank, 120 R.I. 182, 386 A.2d 1090, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 653 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A declaratory judgment action which seeks to challenge the validity of a rezoning amendment must join the party who requested the amendment. Thompson v. Town Council of Town of Westerly, 487 A.2d 498, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 433 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Hearing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court has discretionary power to determine whether to grant or deny a petition for declaratory judgment only after petitioner has had a full hearing on the merits where the petitioner has standing to bring the petition and the subject matter is within the contemplation of the act. Berberian v. Leonard, 99 R.I. 274, 207 A.2d 294, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 430 (1965).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Matters to Be Considered.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where nothing in the record indicated that the terms and conditions of an insurance policy were unclear, unreasonable or unconscionable, and the issue of liability under the policy thus should have been decided on the basis of the terms of the policy and the complaint, the trial justice abused his discretion in denying the application for a declaratory judgment when he improperly considered questions of agency and notice which were not contained in the complaint. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. E. W. Burman, Inc., 120 R.I. 841, 391 A.2d 99, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 731 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Dismissal of a neighborhood association’s declaratory judgment action against a preservation society was appropriate because the issues presented in the association’s complaint—interpretation of zoning ordinances, review of the society’s application, and determination whether to grant a special use permit—were within a local zoning board of review’s jurisdiction and authority, and the association failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. Bellevue-Ochre Point Neighborhood Ass'n v. Preservation Soc'y of Newport Cnty., 151 A.3d 1223, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 8 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Parties.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a declaratory judgment action, a failure to join indispensable parties was fatal; unit owners who received the benefit of a condominium association’s assessment for deck repairs, but who bore the financial burden of the reallocated costs as set forth in the judgment, should have been joined in the lawsuit. The unit owners who were not joined could sue to avoid paying the reassessments ordered by the judgment, and this was antithetical to the purpose of declaratory judgment actions. Burns v. Moorland Farm Condo. Ass'n, 86 A.3d 354, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 27 (R.I. 2014).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since proceeding for a declaratory judgment is neither an action at law nor a suit in equity but a novel statutory proceeding, and since the petition prays for preventive relief by injunction which is obtainable only in equity and since the cause has been concluded below by entry of a final decree as in equity rather than a judgment as at law, a review by appeal is the more appropriate remedy. Newport Amusement Co. v. Maher, 92 R.I. 51, 166 A.2d 216, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 137 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The granting of the remedy provided by this act is purely discretionary, but this discretion is not absolute and its exercise is subject to appropriate appellate review. Employers' Fire Ins. Co. v. Beals, 103 R.I. 623, 240 A.2d 397, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 841 (1968), overruled, Peerless Ins. Co. v. Viegas, 667 A.2d 785, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 285 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A declaratory judgment action, not intervention, is the appropriate remedy for a newspaper to question an order of a trial court sealing depositions in a criminal prosecution. State v. Cianci, 496 A.2d 139, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 565 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The decision to grant a remedy under the Declaratory Judgments Act is purely discretionary, and a decision made in the exercise of a discretionary power should not be disturbed unless it clearly appears that such discretion has been improperly exercised or that there has been an abuse thereof. Lombardi v. Goodyear Loan Co., 549 A.2d 1025, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 131 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A declaratory judgment and the underlying findings of fact and law must be reviewed as any other judgment when it is before the Supreme Court on appeal. Casco Indem. Co. v. O'Connor, 755 A.2d 779, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 164 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Declaratory judgment action was the proper procedural vehicle for an inmate to challenge the computation of “good-time” credits awarded by the Rhode Island department of corrections because under the liberalized provisions of R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 18, 20, declaratory and injunctive relief could be sought in the same action. Gomes v. Wall, 831 A.2d 817, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 192 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Amended Laws.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the action was for a declaratory judgment, it was proper for the appeals court to consider the acts in question as they were amended subsequent to trial rather than as they existed at the time of trial. J. M. Mills, Inc. v. Murphy, 116 R.I. 54, 352 A.2d 661, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1244 (1976).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Supplemental Proceedings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Petitioner in declaratory judgment action is entitled to nothing more than a declaration of his rights and status, even though in appropriate cases some measure of temporary injunctive relief might, in the discretion of the court, be ordered, not by way of relief to petitioner, but for sole purpose of preventing a declaration to which petitioner is entitled from becoming moot, and if supplemental relief becomes necessary it is to be sought in subsequent proceedings under this section. Gray v. Leeman, 94 R.I. 451, 182 A.2d 119, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 107 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section clearly contemplates that where the declaration, when made, does not result in achieving the purpose for which the petition was brought, supplementary proceedings are required and may be brought pursuant thereto.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an insurer sought declaratory judgment that an uninsured motorist claim was not covered by its policy, the trial court retained jurisdiction after ordering contractually required arbitration and properly increased the arbitrator’s award beyond policy limits by adding prejudgment interests and costs; its award of interest was “further relief” under R.I.G.L. § 9-30-8. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tavarez, 797 A.2d 480, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 134 (R.I. 2002), overruled in part, Metro. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Barry, 892 A.2d 915, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 31 (R.I. 2006).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Default.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure to serve the attorney general, who was an indispensable party to the action, effectively voided any default judgment entered, and thus there was no necessity for the defendant to make a showing of a meritorious defense in order to vacate the default judgment. Griffin v. Bendick, 463 A.2d 1340, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1050 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Joinder Not Necessary.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the defendant husband protested that his children should have been named in a wrongful death action for the death of his wife, they would not have been affected by a declaration concerning the husband’s status as a slayer under R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-1.1-1(3). The trial justice in no way was considering their rights as contingent beneficiaries. Tyre v. Swain, 946 A.2d 1189, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 57 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a declaratory judgment action concerning the manner in which state education aid funds received by a regional school district were to be calculated and apportioned to constituent towns, the trial justice did not err in declining to dismiss the action because other school districts had not been joined, as no other persons or entities had an actual, present, adverse, and antagonistic interest in the judgment. Town of Warren v. Bristol Warren Reg'l Sch. Dist., 159 A.3d 1029, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 56 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Water and fire district failed to establish that the hearing justice erred when he determined that the owners of the 53 properties straddling the Middletown-Portsmouth border should not be joined as no demonstration was made that the parties claimed any interest that would be affected by the court’s declaration, or that the declaration would prejudice those owners’ rights.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Middle Creek Farm, LLC v.

<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fact that the non-diverse architect and engineer were named pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-30-1 et seq., in a builder’s action against a diverse owner concerning a construction contract did not relieve the builder of the obligation to allege sufficient facts supporting the claim that the architect and engineer had a legal interest in the proceeding; therefore, because the builder’s complaint stated no cause of action against them and the architect testified that he was joined so the case could not be heard in state court, the architect and builder were fraudulently joined to defeat diversity jurisdiction. Lawrence Builders, Inc. v. Kolodner, 414 F. Supp. 2d 134, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5857 (D.R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Necessary Joinder.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where mayor sought a declaration determining the manner of selection of members for certain local boards the joinder of each member of each of the boards involved was a condition precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction. In re City of Warwick, 97 R.I. 294, 197 A.2d 287 (1964). In accord with In re City of Warwick. See Sullivan v. Chafee, 703 A.2d 748, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 300 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure to join all persons who have an interest that would be affected by the declaration ordinarily is fatal to an action. Thompson v. Town Council of Town of Westerly, 487 A.2d 498, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 433 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where landowners failed to join all the parties to the consent agreement as required under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-30-11 in their declaratory judgment action against a city seeking relief from a consent agreement that affected the public’s riparian rights, the court could not assume subject-mater jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action. Meyer v. City of Newport, 844 A.2d 148, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 57 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a declaratory judgment action, a failure to join indispensable parties was fatal; unit owners who received the benefit of a condominium association’s assessment for deck repairs, but who bore the financial burden of the reallocated costs as set forth in the judgment, should have been joined in the lawsuit. The unit owners who were not joined could sue to avoid paying the reassessments ordered by the judgment, and this was antithetical to the purpose of declaratory judgment actions. Burns v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In fire district’s suit for a declaratory judgment that the district did not have to provide fire protection to a certain property, the fire district did not fail to join an indispensable party by not joining another fire district; the first district was contractually obligated to assume the second district’s responsibilities, so the first district was the proper party to seek clarification of those responsibilities. Moreover, the property owner failed to advance a meaningful appellate argument concerning the issue. Dunn's Corners Fire Dist. v. Westerly Ambulance Corps, 184 A.3d 230, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 55 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Town’s indispensable parties defense had not been adequately preserved for appellate review because the town never brought the indispensable party issue to the attention of the trial court except in a single sentence uttered at the very end of the summary judgment hearing.

<p class="p7"><b>Service on Attorney General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure to serve the attorney general in a declaratory-judgment action warranted dismissal of the action, even though the plaintiff complied with Sup.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although rules relating to service of process must be followed and construed strictly, where an appearance by the assistant attorney general was made within the period that an answer was due in response to the plaintiffs’ complaint alleging the unconstitutionality of a statute, the procedural objectives of this section were effectuated. Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Ass'n v. State, 541 A.2d 69, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 52 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the plaintiffs notified the attorney general of his right to intervene pursuant to Rule 24(d), R.C.P., at the time they filed the complaint, and served the attorney general with a copy of the complaint and other pleadings, and where the attorney general later filed an answer in which he acknowledged service of process, the procedural objectives of this section were effectuated. Westerly Residents for Thoughtful Dev. v. Brancato, 565 A.2d 1262, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 155 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice’s denial of a motion to amend pleadings to include a defense that certain statutes are unconstitutional is not an abuse of discretion, where there is no indication that proper service was made upon the attorney general, as required by this section. Crossman v. Erickson, 570 A.2d 651, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 36 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute does not require that the attorney general be made a party to the action; it only requires that the attorney general “be served with a copy of the proceeding and be entitled to be heard.” The language indicates a legislative intention only to require that the attorney general be given notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard on behalf of the state of Rhode Island. Under the statute the attorney general’s office has the option to intervene in an action, but in its discretion it may choose not to exercise this option. Snicker's, Inc. v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the Attorney General should have been notified of these proceedings, the appeal will not be dismissed because the issues raised by this appeal are significant and the merits should be reached by the court.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant waived the claim that the magistrate in his probation violation case was not statutorily authorized to preside over the probation revocation hearing because the statutory authorization was not constitutional, as defendant did not raise the issue in the trial court and the issue was not novel. Further, defendant could not raise that issue on appeal because defendant did not serve the Attorney General with a copy of the proceeding if defendant intended to challenge the constitutionality of a statute, as was required by R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Private citizens, even attorneys, did not have standing to seek declaratory relief by means of what was essentially a proceeding in quo warranto, challenging the right of Rhode Island’s chief justice to continue in office after accepting an appointment to a federal military review panel; only the attorney general could pursue such relief, and whether that officer should pursue it was not something that a court could compel.

<p class="p7"><b>Purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of the Rhode Island Tort Claims Act is to provide effective relief for persons injured as a result of governmental negligence. Verity v. Danti, 585 A.2d 65, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 5 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Challenges to Statutes.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claims by various individuals and organizations that § 11-19-40 failed to supply sufficient standards to guide the police department in the exercise of its authority to promulgate regulations to carry out the bingo statutory provisions, together with a request that the police be enjoined by the federal court from enforcing its regulations, were barred by the 11th Amendment and were clearly outside the scope of the statutory consent of the state, under this section, to be held “liable in . . . tort . . . .” Allendale Leasing, Inc. v. Stone, 614 F. Supp. 1440, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17165 (D.R.I. 1985), aff'd, 788 F.2d 830, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 24760 (1st Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Discretionary Indemnification of City Officer.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If an officer in the discharge of his public duty in good faith exceeds his authority and thereby becomes liable for damages for his actions, the municipality has the discretion to reimburse him for the legal expenses of a judgment thereby incurred. Plantations Indus. Supply v. Leonelli, 118 R.I. 513, 374 A.2d 1031, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1492 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Duty of Care.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the government or its agent engages in an activity normally undertaken by private individuals in the course of their everyday lives, a duty arises under the common law to exercise reasonable care in the performance of this task. Governmental employees, like ordinary citizens, must operate their vehicles in a reasonably safe manner and avoid creating foreseeably unreasonable risks of harm to the motoring public. Catone v. Medberry, 555 A.2d 328, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 34 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state, as landowner or park operator, acts as a private person might act who is the owner of land and who charges a fee to those who might come upon that land. That duty in accordance with recognized tort principles would be to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition for the benefit of those persons who might come upon the land. O'Brien v. State, 555 A.2d 334, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 35 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the activity the state was engaged in was one that a private individual typically performs, the state owes the public a duty of reasonable care and will be liable for a breach of that duty to the same extent a private individual would be in the same circumstances. Longtin v. D'Ambra Constr. Co., 588 A.2d 1044, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 48 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the state engages in an activity that a private individual typically would not perform, such as the maintenance of state highways or the issuance of state drivers’ licenses, the public duty doctrine will shield the state from liability. Longtin v. D'Ambra Constr. Co., 588 A.2d 1044, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 48 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— “Egregious Conduct” Exception.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the “egregious conduct” exception to the public duty doctrine, the state is not immune from liability even though no special duty to the plaintiff in his or her individual capacity has been shown. The elements that must be established to find that a particular course of conduct is “egregious” are the following: (1) the state, in undertaking a discretionary action or in maintaining or failing to maintain the product of a discretionary action, creates circumstances that forced a reasonably prudent person into a position of extreme peril; (2) the state, through its employees or agents capable of abating the danger, had actual or constructive knowledge of the perilous circumstances; and (3) the state, having been afforded a reasonable amount of time to eliminate the dangerous condition, failed to do so. Haley v. Lincoln, 611 A.2d 845, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 157 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Aside from the special duty exception, a second exception to the public duty doctrine’s general tort immunity is the egregious conduct exception. This exception provides that when the state or its subdivision has knowledge that it has created a circumstance that forces an individual into a position of peril and subsequently chooses not to remedy the situation, the state or its subdivision can then be held liable for its negligence. Boland v. Town of Tiverton, 670 A.2d 1245, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 28 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Special Duty.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The special duty doctrine, an exception to the public duty doctrine, will subject the state to liability despite the fact that the activity engaged in by the state was one that a private individual typically would not perform. In order for plaintiffs to come within the special duty doctrine, plaintiffs must show a breach of some duty owed them in their individual capacities and not merely a breach of some obligation owed the general public. Longtin v. D'Ambra Constr. Co., 588 A.2d 1044, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 48 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Abutting landowners whose property was damaged by the reconstruction of a state highway had standing pursuant to the special duty doctrine to sue the state. Longtin v. D'Ambra Constr. Co., 588 A.2d 1044, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 48 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state may be liable when it performs a discretionary governmental action if the plaintiff can show that she comes within the “special duty” exception to the public duty doctrine. To satisfy the burden of qualifying for such an exception the plaintiff must demonstrate a breach of a duty owed by the state to the plaintiff in his or her individual capacity and “not merely a breach of some obligation owed the general public.” Haley v. Lincoln, 611 A.2d 845, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 157 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The public duty doctrine shields the state and its political subdivisions from tort liability arising out of discretionary governmental actions that are not ordinarily performed by private persons; however, notwithstanding that immunity, liability will attach if it can be determined in a particular setting that the state or its subdivision owed a special duty to the plaintiff. The existence of the special duty can be established when a plaintiff has had prior contact with state or municipal officials who then knowingly embark on a course of conduct that endangers the plaintiff, or when a plaintiff has otherwise specifically come within the knowledge of the officials so that the injury to that particularly identified plaintiff can be or should have been foreseen. Boland v. Town of Tiverton, 670 A.2d 1245, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 28 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiffs, parents of children who were abused while in foster care, argued that a district court should have found that the “special duty” exception to immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1 was applicable given the conclusions in its substantive due process analysis that defendant social worker and her supervisor had a “special relationship” with plaintiffs and that plaintiffs’ evidence sufficed to show negligence. The argument ignored the district court’s finding that there was no evidence presented to show that defendants had any actual knowledge of a substantial risk of harm, plaintiffs did not present evidence showing that defendants could have reasonably foreseen that either of the adult males living in the foster home were likely to abuse the children, and the failure to present such evidence meant that plaintiffs could not satisfy the third prong of the special exception test and defendants remained entitled to immunity for the negligence claims brought against them in their official capacities. J.R. v. Gloria, 593 F.3d 73, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 1823 (1st Cir. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Federal Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the state supreme court, in response to a question certified by a federal district court, ruled that this section manifested a legislative intent to waive the state’s Eleventh Amendment immunity to suits in federal court, that ruling was dispositive of the issue. Della Grotta v. Rhode Island, 781 F.2d 343, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 21783 (1st Cir. 1986), disapproved, Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 109 S. Ct. 2304, 105 L. Ed. 2d 45, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 2975 (1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no need to establish the existence of a special relationship between the state and a motorist who was killed in a collision with a state-owned dump truck simply because of the sovereign status of the state. Catone v. Medberry, 555 A.2d 328, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 34 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3), a district court dismissed without prejudice, a Rhode Island Tort Claims Act suit filed by property owners whose property adjoined a retirement home where the court obtained supplemental jurisdiction over the property owners’ suit when it consolidated it with a related action brought by the retirement home’s owners and residents under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., but it had later entered summary judgment against the home’s owners and residents; there was no reason for the district court to retain jurisdiction over the property owners’ suit as their negligence and common law claims were based in state law and, by themselves, had no business in the district court. Caron v. City of Pawtucket, 307 F. Supp. 2d 364, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3938 (D.R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Negligence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In relying upon the doctrine of judicial immunity in a negligence action, where the state failed to provide proof that a judge was responsible for failure of a capias order’s being cancelled, resulting in the arrest and imprisonment of the plaintiff, the jury was justified in finding negligence to have occurred in the clerk’s office, and the state was thus liable in tort for damages. Calhoun v. Providence, 120 R.I. 619, 390 A.2d 350, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 711 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In suits brought against the state, plaintiffs must show a breach of some duty owed them in their individual capacities and not merely a breach of some obligation owed the general public. Ryan v. Department of Transp., 420 A.2d 841, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1845 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state is not subject to suit by individuals injured as a result of the state’s failure to keep its highways in good repair because the state’s duty in this situation is one owed to the general public and not a special duty owed to the individual drivers on state highways. Knudsen v. Hall, 490 A.2d 976, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 481 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the absence of a special duty owed to the plaintiffs by the state to maintain painted highway “safety lines” near a railroad trestle, there was no basis for state liability for injuries to a passenger in a van which struck the trestle. Kowalski v. Campbell, 520 A.2d 973, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 412 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the presence of a stake in a state park in the location where it is placed is a negligent act, and that negligent act is performed by an employee of the state and would subject a private person to liability under the circumstances, then the state is also responsible for any injury caused. O'Brien v. State, 555 A.2d 334, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 35 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Complaint alleging negligence in supervising a licensed day-care facility attended by the plaintiff ’s daughter may be broadly construed to allege a special duty owed by the state to the plaintiff. Gagnon v. State, 570 A.2d 656, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the public-duty doctrine applies to the design of school bus routes, the doctrine does not insulate municipalities from statutory liability for the negligent operation of school buses. Houle v. Galloway Sch. Lines, 643 A.2d 822, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 199 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Notice Requirements.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Pleading and Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section has been deemed a “blanket waiver” of the state’s sovereign immunity. This waiver does not, however, impose strict liability upon the state in all cases. A plaintiff must still necessarily plead and prove negligence on the part of the state. Longtin v. D'Ambra Constr. Co., 588 A.2d 1044, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 48 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Police Officer’s Duties.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Drunk Drivers.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The act of a special police officer in stopping a car in a restaurant parking lot, ordering the occupants to park it in a vacant lot and to stay parked until they sobered up, then allowing one of the occupants to drive away did not create a special duty owed by the officer to the driver, later injured when the car collided with a utility pole and a tree. The duty imposed by § 31-27-2 (driving under the influence) upon police officers is public in nature. Therefore, the officer was not personally liable to the driver. Barratt v. Burlingham, 492 A.2d 1219, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 510 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Prejudgment Interest.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Prejudgment interest statute does not apply against the state, in action under Tort Claims Act, because such act imposes liability only for damages and prejudgment interest is not an element of damages since it is purely statutory and is peremptorily added to verdict by clerk of court. Andrade v. State, 448 A.2d 1293, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 999 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The providing of security within and by a housing authority was proprietary in nature; thus, an authority could be held liable for prejudgment interest on a judgment arising from injuries sustained by a claimant on housing authority premises. Housing Auth. v. Oropeza, 713 A.2d 1262, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 214 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Procedure.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a governmental entity and/or its officials are sued for alleged negligence, the trial justice — rather than a jury — should determine the existence of any legal duties owing to the plaintiff and communicate to the jury what those duties consist of under the circumstances of the case. Kuzniar v. Keach, 709 A.2d 1050, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 132 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action against a municipality raising the issue of the special-duty exception to the public-duty doctrine, the trial court erred in leaving it entirely up to the jury whether the defendant municipality and certain of its officials owed a legal duty to the plaintiff. Kuzniar v. Keach, 709 A.2d 1050, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 132 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By failing to raise the claim during the administrative proceedings before the Administrative Review Board of the Department of Labor, the administrative law judge, or the Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health, the employees forfeited the claim that the state waived sovereign immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1 on the employees’ whistleblower allegations. Taylor v. United States DOL, 440 F.3d 1, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 27094 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Public Duty Doctrine.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The public duty doctrine shields the state and its political subdivisions from tort liability arising out of discretionary governmental actions that by their nature are not ordinarily performed by private persons. Haley v. Lincoln, 611 A.2d 845, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 157 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a worker injured in a construction project sued a town for his injuries because it erroneously issued a building permit for the project without obtaining the contractor’s registration number, as required by R.I. Gen. Laws § 5-65-3(c), the town was entitled to summary judgment because: (1) the issuance of building permits was immune under the public duty doctrine, despite the general waiver of sovereign immunity in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1, as no private entity could do it; (2) the special duty exception to the public duty doctrine did not apply to the worker, as the building inspector who issued the building permit was not specifically aware of the worker, and R.I. Gen. Laws § 5-65-3(c) did not create a special duty to those in the worker’s position, because the statute’s duty was owed to the general public; and (3) the egregious conduct exception to the public duty doctrine did not apply because the inspector who issued the permit did not know it was issued to an unlicensed contractor, nor did the inspector know an unlicensed contractor was actually building this particular project. Torres v. Damicis, 853 A.2d 1233, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 146 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Summary judgment for a department in a case alleging distribution of contaminated food was improper because the government function at issue—the storage and distribution of food—was an activity that private persons and businesses performed regularly, so the public duty doctrine did not apply, and the department was not shielded from liability under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1. Adams v. R.I. Dep't of Corr., 973 A.2d 542, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 104 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>City was entitled to summary judgment in a driver’s suit claiming that dangerous traffic conditions at an intersection led to a traffic accident because the city’s placement of traffic-control devices was a discretionary governmental activity shielded from R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1 liability under the public-duty doctrine; although the driver claimed that the public-duty doctrine did not apply in light of the guideline of R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-13-3, the driver failed to cite any particular state mandate with which the city allegedly did not comply. Toegemann v. City of Providence, 21 A.3d 384, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 92 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Activity giving rise to plaintiff’s injuries was not a discretionary governmental function warranting immunity; plaintiff, a per diem contract nurse, asserted that the negligence of a nurse or housekeeper caused her slip and fall injuries, and regardless of whether this incident occurred in the Veterans Home or a private nursing home, the underlying function at issue, resident-patient care, remained unchanged, and the public-duty doctrine did not apply.

<p class="p7"><b>Punitive Damages.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not contemplate an award of punitive damages against the state since the language of this section does not expressly address the issue of punitive damages; a punitive damage award against the state or municipality is contrary to public policy.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Property owner’s federal takings claim against state agencies and state officials was unripe because the property owner did not show that a cause of action for inverse condemnation under Rhode Island law was unavailable or inadequate to compensate for takings. Even if the damages cap in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-2 applied and compromised the adequacy of the state law inverse condemnation claim, the property owner’s takings claim would not be deemed ripe until the property owner pursued damages above the $ 100,000 limit.

<p class="p7"><b>Correctional Institutions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Maintenance of correctional institution is a governmental function; thus, limitation of damages established by this section applies to tort action involving maintenance of such institution. Saunders v. State, 446 A.2d 748, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 890 (R.I. 1982).</p>

Pridemore v. Napolitano, 689 A.2d 1053, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 64 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Prejudgment Interest.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Prejudgment interest was appropriate because the Veterans Home acted in a proprietary, rather than governmental, manner; as the statutory tort cap was inapplicable, the State, like any private person, was subject to prejudgment interest.

<p class="p7"><b>Proprietary Function.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Statutory tort cap was inapplicable based on the Veterans Home’s performance of a proprietary function; while the Veterans Home was capable of fulfilling both governmental and proprietary functions, the events giving rise to liability—the resident-care functions of nurses or contracted housekeepers—constituted proprietary functions.

<p class="p7"><b>Public Schools.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The operation and maintenance of a public school is a governmental function and not a proprietary one.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Utah order denying a nonresident shareholder’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction was not entitled to full faith and credit in Rhode Island because the issue of personal jurisdiction as to the shareholder was not fully and fairly litigated and then finally decided in Utah.

<p class="p6">The legislature finds and declares that full participation by persons and organizations and robust discussion of issues of public concern before the legislative, judicial, and administrative bodies and in other public fora are essential to the democratic process, that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances; that such litigation is disfavored and should be resolved quickly with minimum cost to citizens who have participated in matters of public concern.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> A party’s exercise of his or her right of petition or of free speech under the United States or Rhode Island constitutions in connection with a matter of public concern shall be conditionally immune from civil claims, counterclaims, or cross-claims. Such immunity will apply as a bar to any civil claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim directed at petition or free speech as defined in subsection (e) of this section, except if the petition or free speech constitutes a sham. The petition or free speech constitutes a sham only if it is not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government action, result, or outcome, regardless of ultimate motive or purpose. The petition or free speech will be deemed to constitute a sham as defined in the previous sentence only if it is both:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable person exercising the right of speech or petition could realistically expect success in procuring the government action, result, or outcome, and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Subjectively baseless in the sense that it is actually an attempt to use the governmental process itself for its own direct effects. Use of outcome or result of the governmental process shall not constitute use of the governmental process itself for its own direct effects.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The court shall stay all discovery proceedings in the action upon the filing of a motion asserting the immunity established by this section; provided, however, that the court, on motion and after a hearing and for good cause shown, may order that specified discovery be conducted. The stay of discovery shall remain in effect until notice of entry of the order ruling on the motion.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The immunity established by this section may be asserted by an appropriate motion or by other appropriate means under the applicable rules of civil procedure.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> If the court grants the motion asserting the immunity established by this section, or if the party claiming lawful exercise of his or her right of petition or of free speech under the United States or Rhode Island constitutions in connection with a matter of public concern is, in fact, the eventual prevailing party at trial, the court shall award the prevailing party costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, including those incurred for the motion and any related discovery matters. The court shall award compensatory damages and may award punitive damages upon a showing by the prevailing party that the responding party’s claims, counterclaims, or cross-claims were frivolous or were brought with an intent to harass the party or otherwise inhibit the party’s exercise of its right to petition or free speech under the United States or Rhode Island constitution. Nothing in this section shall affect or preclude the right of the party claiming lawful exercise of his or her right of petition or of free speech under the United States or Rhode Island constitutions to any remedy otherwise authorized by law.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> As used in this section, “a party’s exercise of its right of petition or of free speech” shall mean any written or oral statement made before or submitted to a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding; any written or oral statement made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding; or any written or oral statement made in connection with an issue of public concern.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Action for Damages.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Anti-SLAPP (strategic litigation against public participation) statute, R.I. Gen. Laws 9-33, cannot reasonably be read as providing a mechanism by which a party may file a separate “SLAPP-back” lawsuit. Rather, the statute provides that, in the same civil action in which a party has successfully invoked the conditional immunity granted by the anti-SLAPP statute, the court in that case shall award compensatory damages and may award punitive damages pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-33-2; there is no suggestion in the statute that there should subsequently be a separate civil action. Palazzo v. Alves, 944 A.2d 144, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 33 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Assertion of Immunity.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The “appropriate motion” or “or other appropriate means” described in the 1995 amendment of subsection (c) is a motion for summary judgment that will allow the hearing justice to consider information extrinsic to the pleadings. Hometown Props. v. Fleming, 680 A.2d 56, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 188 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a citizen’s letters to the editor of a newspaper voicing his opinion on a public school construction project were exercises of free speech, summary judgment in favor of the citizen was appropriate as to the Limits on Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation Act (anti-SLAPP statute), R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By electing to file a motion to dismiss in a first action against them for defamation by asserting conditional immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-33-2 the defendants lost any inchoate right to file a subsequent malicious prosecution action. The General Assembly obviated the need for a successful SLAPP litigant to file a subsequent lawsuit to recover damages by providing for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees, within the ambit of the anti-SLAPP suit itself. Palazzo v. Alves, 944 A.2d 144, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 33 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a condominium association’s correspondence with the Coastal Resource Management Commission regarding a unit owner’s application for expansion of his unit was aimed at procuring a favorable government outcome and reasonably stated that the owner did not exclusively own the property onto which he sought to expand, the correspondence enjoyed the free speech protections afforded by the anti-SLAPP statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-33-2. Sisto v. Am. Condo. Ass'n, 68 A.3d 603, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 114 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Attorneys’ Fees.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a neighbor who prevailed under the anti-SLAPP (Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation) statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-33-2, in a landowner’s abuse of process claim was entitled to attorneys’ fees under the statute, the motion justice did not abuse her discretion in finding the neighbor’s attorneys’ fees should not have included fees incurred in an unsuccessful summary judgment motion and unsuccessful petition for a writ of certiorari. Karousos v. Pardee, 992 A.2d 263, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 47 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendants prevailed under the limits on strategic litigation against public participation (anti-SLAPP) statute, and thus an award of attorney’s fees under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-33-2(d) in defendants’ favor was mandatory. Sisto v. Am. Condo. Ass'n, 140 A.3d 124, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 95 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the mandate made no mention of attorney’s fees in connection with the appeal, this did not preclude the superior court from subsequently awarding defendants attorney’s fees incurred in defending the judgment on appeal; fees were mandatory under the statute and thus the mandate left the determination of the proper award of fees to the superior court. Sisto v. Am. Condo. Ass'n, 140 A.3d 124, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 95 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff challenged the award of attorney’s fees on the basis of res judicata, but the doctrine did not apply because no second cause of action had been filed, and the original cause of action remained ongoing. Sisto v. Am. Condo. Ass'n, 140 A.3d 124, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 95 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Hearing justice did not abuse his discretion in awarding attorney’s fees to defendants in connection with their appeal, as he reduced defendants’ request by 75% to more accurately reflect the time spent on the tangentially related claim under the limits on strategic litigation against public participation (anti-SLAPP) statute, and the billing records were not a diligent accounting for the time spent on the anti-SLAPP appeal; furthermore, the hearing justice then increased the reduced fee by 5% based on the complexity of the anti-SLAPP claim, and no abuse of discretion was found. Sisto v. Am. Condo. Ass'n, 140 A.3d 124, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 95 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Right of Petition.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a suit by the owners of a city landfill against a city resident alleging tortious interference with contractual relations and defamation, the defendant’s written statements, submitted to an executive body as well as to legislators, were made in connection with an issue under consideration by the Department of Environmental Management and in connection with an issue of public concern, namely potential environmental contamination resulting from the plaintiff’s activities, and therefore clearly constituted an exercise of her right of petition and free speech within the meaning of subsection (e). Hometown Props. v. Fleming, 680 A.2d 56, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 188 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sham Petitions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature intended the 1995 amendment to clarify and not to cloud the material provisions of this section, and intended that the term “tortious conduct” in the 1993 act be synonymous with the term “sham petitioning” in the 1995 amendment. Hometown Props. v. Fleming, 680 A.2d 56, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 188 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Waiver.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By not requesting compensatory and punitive damages in a first lawsuit against them for defamation in which they asserted conditional immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-33-2, two brothers waived their damages claims. Moreover, their claims were barred by res judicata; the parties and the issues were identical, and the brothers’ damages claims could have, and should have, been made in the original action. Palazzo v. Alves, 944 A.2d 144, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 33 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Zoning Appeals.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the plaintiff presented insufficient facts and allegations to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether the defendant had probable cause to appeal a zoning amendment to the Superior Court, and, at trial, the defendant presented expert and lay testimony in support of its position, the defendant’s appeal of the zoning decision was not objectively baseless, and the appeal was not a “sham” that would bar the conditional immunity provided by this section. Cove Rd. Dev. v. Western Cranston Indus. Park Assocs., 674 A.2d 1234, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 134 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a landowner’s abuse of process claim against a neighbor, the neighbor’s appeal to a zoning board was not a sham and warranted immunity under the anti-SLAPP (Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation) statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-33-2(a)(2), because the neighbor’s appeal was not subjectively baseless; the neighbor testified the purpose of the zoning appeal was to prevent the landowner from using a building on his property as a culinary school and the landowner failed to offer evidence the neighbor sought the zoning appeal for its direct effect and not for its outcome.

<p class="p7"><b>Official Comment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Source: This section is derived from Section 1 of the Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act of 1962.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. The defined terms “foreign state” and “foreign judgment” in the 1962 Act have been changed to “foreign country” and “foreign-country judgment” in order to make it clear that the Act does not apply to recognition of sister-state judgments. Some courts have noted that the “foreign state” and “foreign judgment” definitions of the 1962 Act have caused confusion as to whether the Act should apply to sister-state judgments because “foreign state” and “foreign judgment” are terms of art generally used in connection with recognition and enforcement of sister-state judgments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>See, e.g.,</i>Eagle Leasing v. Amandus, 476 N.W.2d 35 (S. Ct. Iowa 1991) (reversing lower court’s application of UFMJRA to a sister-state judgment, but noting lower court’s confusion was understandable as “foreign judgment” is term of art normally applied to sister-state judgments).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>See also,</i> Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act § 1 (defining “foreign judgment” as the judgment of a sister state or federal court).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The 1962 Act defines a “foreign state” as “any governmental unit other than the United States, or any state, district, commonwealth, territory, insular possession thereof, or the Panama Canal Zone, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or the Ryuku Islands.” Rather than simply updating the list in the 1962 Act’s definition of “foreign state,” the new definition of “foreign country” in this Act combines the “listing” approach of the 1962 Act’s “foreign state” definition with a provision that defines “foreign country” in terms of whether the judgments of the particular government’s courts are initially subject to the Full Faith and Credit Clause standards for determining whether those judgments will be recognized. Under this new definition, a governmental unit is a “foreign country” if it is (1) not the United States or a state, district, commonwealth, territory or insular possession of the United States; and (2) its judgments are not initially subject to Full Faith and Credit Clause standards.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Full Faith and Credit Clause, Art. IV, section 1, provides that “Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records, and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.” Whether the judgments of a governmental unit are subject to the Full Faith and Credit Clause may be determined by judicial interpretation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause or by statute, or by a combination of these two sources. For example, pursuant to the authority granted by the second sentence of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Congress has passed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>28 U.S.C.A. § 1738, which provides<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>inter alia</i> that court records from “any State, Territory, or Possession of the United States” are entitled to full faith and credit under the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Full Faith and Credit Clause. In<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Stoll v. Gottlieb</i>, 305 U.S. 165, 170 (1938), the United States Supreme Court held that this statute also requires that full faith and credit be given to judgments of federal courts. States also have made determinations as to whether certain types of judgments are subject to the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Full Faith and Credit Clause.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>E.g.</i> Day v. Montana Dept. Of Social &amp; Rehab. Servs., 900 P.2d 296 (Mont. 1995) (tribal court judgment not subject to Full Faith and Credit, and should be treated with same deference shown foreign-country judgments). Under the definition of “foreign country” in this Act, the determination as to whether a governmental unit’s judgments are subject to full faith and credit standards should be made by reference to any relevant law, whether statutory or decisional, that is applicable “in this state.”</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The definition of “foreign country” in terms of those judgments not subject to Full Faith and Credit standards also has the advantage of more effectively coordinating the Act with the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act. That Act, which establishes a registration procedure for the enforcement of sister state and equivalent judgments, defines a “foreign judgment” as “any judgment, decree, or order of a court of the United States or of any other court which is entitled to full faith and credit in this state.” Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, § 1 (1964). By defining “foreign country” in the Recognition Act in terms of those judgments not subject to full faith and credit standards, this Act makes it clear that the Enforcement Act and the Recognition Act are mutually exclusive – if a foreign money judgment is subject to full faith and credit standards, then the Enforcement Act’s registration procedure is available with regard to its enforcement; if the foreign money judgment is not subject to full faith and credit standards, then the foreign money judgment may not be enforced until recognition of it has been obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Recognition Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. The definition of “foreign-country judgment” in this Act differs significantly from the 1962 Act’s definition of “foreign judgment.” The 1962 Act’s definition served in large part as a scope provision for the Act. The part of the definition defining the scope of the Act has been moved to section 3, which is the scope section.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. The definition of “foreign-country judgment” in this Act refers to “a judgment” of “a court” of the foreign country. The foreign-country judgment need not take a particular form – any order or decree that meets the requirements of this section and comes within the scope of the Act under Section 3 is subject to the Act. Similarly, any competent government tribunal that issues such a “judgment” comes within the term “court” for purposes of this Act. The judgment, however, must be a judgment of an adjudicative body of the foreign country, and not the result of an alternative dispute mechanism chosen by the parties. Thus, foreign arbitral awards and agreements to arbitrate are not covered by this Act. They are governed instead by federal law, Chapter 2 of the U.S. Arbitration Act,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>9 U.S.C. §§ 201- 208, implementing the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and Chapter 3 of the U.S. Arbitration Act,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>9 U.S.C. §§ 301- 307, implementing the Inter-American Convention on International Commercial Arbitration. A judgment of a foreign court confirming or setting aside an arbitral award, however, would be covered by this Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. The definition of “foreign-country judgment” does not limit foreign-country judgments to those rendered in litigation between private parties. Judgments in which a governmental entity is a party also are included, and are subject to this Act if they meet the requirements of this section and are within the scope of the Act under Section 3.</p>

<p class="p5">Annotations</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Official Comment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Source: This section is based on Section 2 of the 1962 Act. Subsection (b) contains material that was included as part of the definition of “foreign judgment” in Section 1(2) of the 1962 Act. Subsection (c) is new.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Like the 1962 Act, this Act sets out in subsection 3(a) two basic requirements that a foreign-country judgment must meet before it comes within the scope of this Act – the foreign-country judgment must (1) grant or deny recovery of a sum of money and (2) be final, conclusive and enforceable under the law of the foreign country where it was rendered. Subsection 3(b) then sets out three types of foreign-country judgments that are excluded from the coverage of this Act, even though they meet the criteria of subsection 3(a) – judgments for taxes, judgments constituting fines and other penalties, and judgments in domestic relations matters. These exclusions are comparable to those contained in Section 1(2) of the 1962 Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. This Act applies to a foreign-country judgment only to the extent the foreign-country judgment grants or denies recovery of a sum of money. If a foreign-country judgment both grants or denies recovery of a sum money and provides for some other form of relief, this Act would apply to the portion of the judgment that grants or denies monetary relief, but not to the portion that provides for some other form of relief. The U.S. court, however, would be left free to decide to recognize and enforce the non-monetary portion of the judgment under principles of comity or other applicable law. See Section 11.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. In order to come within the scope of this Act, a foreign-country judgment must be final, conclusive, and enforceable under the law of the foreign country in which it was rendered. This requirement contains three distinct, although inter-related concepts. A judgment is final when it is not subject to additional proceedings in the rendering court other than execution. A judgment is conclusive when it is given effect between the parties as a determination of their legal rights and obligations. A judgment is enforceable when the legal procedures of the state to ensure that the judgment debtor complies with the judgment are available to the judgment creditor to assist in collection of the judgment.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the first two of these requirements – finality and conclusiveness – will apply with regard to every foreign-country money judgment, the requirement of enforceability is only relevant when the judgment is one granting recovery of a sum of money. A judgment denying a sum of money obviously is not subject to enforcement procedures, as there is no monetary award to enforce. This Act, however, covers both judgments granting and those denying recovery of a sum of money. Thus, the fact that a foreign-country judgment denying recovery of a sum of money is not enforceable does not mean that such judgments are not within the scope of the Act. Instead, the requirement that the judgment be enforceable should be read to mean that, if the foreign-country judgment grants recovery of a sum of money, it must be enforceable in the foreign country in order to be within the scope of the Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Like the 1962 Act, subsection 3(b) requires that the determinations as to finality, conclusiveness and enforceability be made using the law of the foreign country in which the judgment was rendered. Unless the foreign-country judgment is final, conclusive, and (to the extent it grants recovery of a sum of money) enforceable in the foreign country where it was rendered, it will not be within the scope of this Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Subsection 3(b) follows the 1962 Act by excluding three categories of foreign-country money judgments from the scope of the Act – judgments for taxes, judgments that constitute fines and penalties, and judgments in domestic relations matters. The domestic relations exclusion has been redrafted to make it clear that all judgments in domestic relations matters are excluded from the Act, not just judgments “for support” as provided in the 1962 Act. This is consistent with interpretation of the 1962 Act by the courts, which extended the “support” exclusion in the 1962 Act beyond its literal wording to exclude other money judgments in connection with domestic matters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>E.g.</i>, Wolff v. Wolff, 389 A.2d 413 (My. App. 1978) (“support” includes alimony).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Recognition and enforcement of domestic relations judgments traditionally has been treated differently from recognition and enforcement of other judgments. The considerations with regard to those judgments, particularly with regard to jurisdiction and finality, differ from those with regard to other money judgments. Further, national laws with regard to domestic relations vary widely, and recognition and enforcement of such judgments thus is more appropriately handled through comity than through use of this uniform Act. Finally, other statutes, such as the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act and the federal International Child Support Enforcement Act,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>42 U.S.C. § 659a (1996), address various aspects of the recognition and enforcement of domestic relations awards. Under Section 11 of this Act, courts are free to recognize money judgments in domestic relations matters under principles of comity or otherwise, and U.S. courts routinely enforce money judgments in domestic relations matters under comity principles.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Foreign-country judgments for taxes and judgments that constitute fines or penalties traditionally have not been recognized and enforced in U.S. courts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>See, e.g.</i>,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Restatement Third of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States § 483 (1986). Both the “revenue rule,” under which the courts of one country will not enforce the revenue laws of another country, and the prohibition on enforcement of penal judgments seem to be grounded in the idea that one country does not enforce the public laws of another.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>See id</i>. Reporters’ Note 2. The exclusion of tax judgments and judgments constituting fines or penalties from the scope of the Act reflects this tradition. Under Section 11, however, courts remain free to consider whether such judgments should be recognized and enforced under comity or other principles.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A judgment for taxes is a judgment in favor of a foreign country or one of its subdivisions based on a claim for an assessment of a tax. Thus, a judgment awarding a plaintiff restitution of the purchase price paid for an item would not be considered in any part a judgment for taxes, even though one element of the recovery was the sales tax paid by the plaintiff at the time of purchase. Such a judgment would not be one designed to enforce the revenue laws of the foreign country, but rather one designed to compensate the plaintiff. Courts generally hold that the test for whether a judgment is a fine or penalty is determined by whether its purpose is remedial in nature, with its benefits accruing to private individuals, or it is penal in nature, punishing an offense against public justice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>E.g.</i>, Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. v. Hoffman, 665 F.Supp 73 (D. Mass. 1987) (finding that Belgium judgment was not penal even though the proceeding forming the basis of the suit was primarily criminal where Belgium court considered damage petition a civil remedy, the judgment did not constitute punishment for an offense against public justice of Belgium, and benefit of the judgment accrued to private judgment creditor, not Belgium). Thus, a judgment that awards compensation or restitution for the benefit of private individuals should not automatically be considered penal in nature and therefore outside the scope of the Act simply because the action is brought on behalf of the private individuals by a government entity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Cf.</i> U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement, art.14.7.2, U.S.-Austl., May 18, 2004 (providing that when government agency obtains a civil monetary judgment for purpose of providing restitution to consumers, investors, or customers who suffered economic harm due to fraud, judgment generally should not be denied recognition and enforcement on ground that it is penal or revenue in nature, or based on other foreign public law).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Under subsection 3(b), a foreign-country money judgment is not within the scope of this Act “to the extent” that it comes within one of the excluded categories. Therefore, if a foreign-country money judgment is only partially within one of the excluded categories, the non-excluded portion will be subject to this Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Subsection 3(c) is new. The 1962 Act does not expressly allocate the burden of proof with regard to establishing whether a foreign-country judgment is within the scope of the Act. Courts applying the 1962 Act generally have held that the burden of proof is on the person seeking recognition to establish that the judgment is final, conclusive and enforceable where rendered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>E.g.</i>, Mayekawa Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. Sasaki, 888 P.2d 183, 189 (Wash. App. 1995) (burden of proof on creditor to establish judgment is final, conclusive, and enforceable where rendered);<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bridgeway Corp. v. Citibank, 45 F. Supp. 2d 276, 285 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (party seeking recognition must establish that there is a final judgment, conclusive and enforceable where rendered);<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>S.C.Chimexim S.A. v. Velco Enterprises, Ltd., 36 F. Supp. 2d 206, 212 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (Plaintiff has the burden of establishing conclusive effect). Subsection (3)(c) places the burden of proof to establish whether a foreign-country judgment is within the scope of the Act on the party seeking recognition of the foreign-country judgment with regard to both subsection (a) and subsection (b).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Source: This section is based on Section 4 of the 1962 Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This Section provides the standards for recognition of a foreign-country money judgment. Section 7 sets out the effect of recognition of a foreign-country money judgment under this Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Recognition of a judgment means that the forum court accepts the determination of legal rights and obligations made by the rendering court in the foreign country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>See, e.g.</i> Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws, Ch. 5, Topic 3, Introductory Note (recognition of foreign judgment occurs to the extent the forum court gives the judgment “the same effect with respect to the parties, the subject matter of the action and the issues involved that it has in the state where it was rendered.”) Recognition of a foreign-country judgment must be distinguished from enforcement of that judgment. Enforcement of the foreign-country judgment involves the application of the legal procedures of the state to ensure that the judgment debtor obeys the foreign-country judgment. Recognition of a foreign-country money judgment often is associated with enforcement of the judgment, as the judgment creditor usually seeks recognition of the foreign-country judgment primarily for the purpose of invoking the enforcement procedures of the forum state to assist the judgment creditor’s collection of the judgment from the judgment debtor. Because the forum court cannot enforce the foreign-country judgment until it has determined that the judgment will be given effect, recognition is a prerequisite to enforcement of the foreign-country judgment. Recognition, however, also has significance outside the enforcement context because a foreign-country judgment also must be recognized before it can be given preclusive effect under res judicata and collateral estoppel principles. The issue of whether a foreign-country judgment will be recognized is distinct from both the issue of whether the judgment will be enforced, and the issue of the extent to which it will be given preclusive effect.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Subsection 4(a) places an affirmative duty on the forum court to recognize a foreign-country money judgment unless one of the grounds for nonrecognition stated in subsection (b) or (c) applies. Subsection (b) states three mandatory grounds for denying recognition to a foreign-country money judgment. If the forum court finds that one of the grounds listed in subsection (b) exists, then it must deny recognition to the foreign-country money judgment. Subsection (c) states eight nonmandatory grounds for denying recognition. The forum court has discretion to decide whether or not to refuse recognition based on one of these grounds. Subsection (d) places the burden of proof on the party resisting recognition of the foreign-country judgment to establish that one of the grounds for nonrecognition exists.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. The mandatory grounds for nonrecognition stated in subsection (b) are identical to the mandatory grounds stated in Section 4 of the 1962 Act. The discretionary grounds stated in subsection 4(c)(1) through (6) are based on subsection 4(b)(1) through (6) of the 1962 Act. The discretionary grounds stated in subsection 4(c)(7) and (8) are new.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Under subsection (b)(1), the forum court must deny recognition to the foreign-country money judgment if that judgment was “rendered under a judicial system that does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law.” The standard for this ground for nonrecognition “has been stated authoritatively by the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Supreme Court of the United States in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Hilton v. Guyot</i>, 159 U.S.113, 205 (1895). As indicated in that decision, a mere difference in the procedural system is not a sufficient basis for nonrecognition. A case of serious injustice must be involved.” Cmt § 4, Uniform Foreign Money-Judgment Recognition Act (1962).

Procedural differences, such as absence of jury trial or different evidentiary rules are not sufficient to justify denying recognition under subsection (b)(1), so long as the essential elements of impartial administration and basic procedural fairness have been provided in the foreign proceeding. As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Hilton</i>:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there has been opportunity for a full and fair trial abroad before a court of competent jurisdiction conducting the trial upon regular proceedings, after due citation or voluntary appearance of the defendant, and under a system of jurisprudence likely to secure an impartial administration of justice between the citizens of its own country and those of other countries, and there is nothing to show either prejudice in the court, or in the system of laws under which it was sitting, or fraud in procuring the judgment, or any other special reason why the comity of this nation should not allow it full effect then a foreign-country judgment should be recognized.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Hilton</i>,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>159 U.S. at 202.</p>

Under section 4(b)(2), the forum court must deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if the foreign court did not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Section 5(a) lists six bases for personal jurisdiction that are adequate as a matter of law to establish that the foreign court had personal jurisdiction. Section 5(b) makes clear that other grounds for personal jurisdiction may be found sufficient.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. Subsection 4(c)(2) limits the type of fraud that will serve as a ground for denying recognition to extrinsic fraud. This provision is consistent with the interpretation of the comparable provision in subsection 4(b)(2) of the 1962 Act by the courts, which have found that only extrinsic fraud — conduct of the prevailing party that deprived the losing party of an adequate opportunity to present its case — is sufficient under the 1962 Act. Examples of extrinsic fraud would be when the plaintiff deliberately had the initiating process served on the defendant at the wrong address, deliberately gave the defendant wrong information as to the time and place of the hearing, or obtained a default judgment against the defendant based on a forged confession of judgment. When this type of fraudulent action by the plaintiff deprives the defendant of an adequate opportunity to present its case, then it provides grounds for denying recognition of the foreign-country judgment. Extrinsic fraud should be distinguished from intrinsic fraud, such as false testimony of a witness or admission of a forged document into evidence during the foreign proceeding. Intrinsic fraud does not provide a basis for denying recognition under subsection 4(c)(2), as the assertion that intrinsic fraud has occurred should be raised and dealt with in the rendering court.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>8. The public policy exception in subsection 4(c)(3) is based on the public policy exception in subsection 4(b)(3) of the 1962 Act, with one difference. The public policy exception in the 1962 Act states that the relevant inquiry is whether “the [cause of action] [claim for relief] on which the judgment is based” is repugnant to public policy. Based on this “cause of action” language, some courts interpreting the 1962 Act have refused to find that a public policy challenge based on something other than repugnancy of the foreign cause of action comes within this exception.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>E.g.</i>, Southwest Livestock &amp; Trucking Co., Inc. v. Ramon, 169 F.3d 317 (5th Cir. 1999) (refusing to deny recognition to Mexican judgment on promissory note with interest rate of 48% because cause of action to collect on promissory note does not violate public policy);<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Guinness PLC v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although subsection 4(c)(3) of this Act rejects the narrow focus on the cause of action under the 1962 Act, it retains the stringent test for finding a public policy violation applied by courts interpreting the 1962 Act. Under that test, a difference in law, even a marked one, is not sufficient to raise a public policy issue. Nor is it relevant that the foreign law allows a recovery that the forum state would not allow. Public policy is violated only if recognition or enforcement of the foreign-country judgment would tend clearly to injure the public health, the public morals, or the public confidence in the administration of law, or would undermine “that sense of security for individual rights, whether of personal liberty or of private property, which any citizen ought to feel.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hunt v. BP Exploration Co. (Libya) Ltd., 492 F. Supp. 885, 901 (N.D. Tex. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The language “or of the United States” in subsection 4(c)(3), which does not appear in the 1962 Act provision, makes it clear that the relevant public policy is that of both the State in which recognition is sought and that of the United States. This is the position taken by the vast majority of cases interpreting the 1962 public policy provision.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>E.g., Bachchan v. India Abroad Publications, Inc., 585 N.Y.S.2d 661 (Sup.Ct. N.Y. 1992) (British libel judgment denied recognition because it violates First Amendment).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>9. Subsection 4(c)(5) allows the forum court to refuse recognition of a foreign-country judgment when the parties had a valid agreement, such as a valid forum selection clause or agreement to arbitrate, providing that the relevant dispute would be resolved in a forum other than the forum issuing the foreign-country judgment. Under this provision, the forum court must find both the existence of a valid agreement and that the agreement covered the subject matter involved in the foreign litigation resulting in the foreign-country judgment.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>10. Subsection 4(c)(6) authorizes the forum court to refuse recognition of a foreign-country judgment that was rendered in the foreign country solely on the basis of personal service when the forum court believes the original action should have been dismissed by the court in the foreign country on grounds of forum non conveniens.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>11. Subsection 4(c)(7) is new. Under this subsection, the forum court may deny recognition to a foreign-country judgment if there are circumstances that raise substantial doubt about the integrity of the rendering court with respect to that judgment. It requires a showing of corruption in the particular case that had an impact on the judgment that was rendered. This provision may be contrasted with subsection 4(b)(1), which requires that the forum court refuse recognition to the foreign-country judgment if it was rendered under a judicial system that does not provide impartial tribunals. Like the comparable provision in subsection 4(a)(1) of the 1962 Act, subsection 4(b)(1) focuses on the judicial system of the foreign country as a whole, rather than on whether the particular judicial proceeding leading to the foreign-country judgment was impartial and fair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>See, e.g.</i>,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Society of Lloyd’s v. Turner, 303 F.3d 325, 330 (5th Cir. 2002) (interpreting the 1962 Act); CIBC Mellon Trust Co. v. Mora Hotel Corp,.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>N.V., 743 N.Y.S.2d 408, 415 (N.Y. App. 2002) (interpreting the 1962 Act);<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Society of Lloyd’s v. Ashenden, 233 F.3d 473, 477 (7th Cir. 2000) (interpreting the 1962 Act). On the other hand, subsection 4(c)(7) allows the court to deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if it finds a lack of impartiality and fairness of the tribunal in the individual proceeding leading to the foreign-country judgment. Thus, the difference is that between showing, for example, that corruption and bribery is so prevalent throughout the judicial system of the foreign country as to make that entire judicial system one that does not provide impartial tribunals versus showing that bribery of the judge in the proceeding that resulted in the particular foreign-country judgment under consideration had a sufficient impact on the ultimate judgment as to call it into question.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>12. Subsection 4(c)(8) also is new. It allows the forum court to deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if the court finds that the specific proceeding in the foreign court was not compatible with the requirements of fundamental fairness. Like subsection 4(c)(7), it can be contrasted with subsection 4(b)(1), which requires the forum court to deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if the forum court finds that the entire judicial system in the foreign country where the foreign-country judgment was rendered does not provide procedures compatible with the requirements of fundamental fairness. While the focus of subsection 4(b)(1) is on the foreign country’s judicial system as a whole, the focus of subsection 4(c)(8) is on the particular proceeding that resulted in the specific foreign-country judgment under consideration. Thus, the difference is that between showing, for example, that there has been such a breakdown of law and order in the particular foreign country that judgments are rendered on the basis of political decisions rather than the rule of law throughout the judicial system versus a showing that for political reasons the particular party against whom the foreign-country judgment was entered was denied fundamental fairness in the particular proceedings leading to the foreign-country judgment.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsections 4(c)(7) and (8) both are discretionary grounds for denying recognition, while subsection 4(b)(1) is mandatory. Obviously, if the entire judicial system in the foreign country fails to satisfy the requirements of impartiality and fundamental fairness, a judgment rendered in that foreign country would be so compromised that the forum court should refuse to recognize it as a matter of course. On the other hand, if the problem is evidence of a lack of integrity or fundamental fairness with regard to the particular proceeding leading to the foreign-country judgment, then there may or may not be other factors in the particular case that would cause the forum court to decide to recognize the foreign-country judgment. For example, a forum court might decide not to exercise its discretion to deny recognition despite evidence of corruption or procedural unfairness in a particular case because the party resisting recognition failed to raise the issue on appeal from the foreign-country judgment in the foreign country, and the evidence establishes that, if the party had done so, appeal would have been an adequate mechanism for correcting the transgressions of the lower court.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>13. Under subsection 4(d), the party opposing recognition of the foreign-country judgment has the burden of establishing that one of the grounds for nonrecognition set out in subsection 4(b) or (c) applies. The 1962 Act was silent as to who had the burden of proof to establish a ground for nonrecognition and courts applying the 1962 Act took different positions on the issue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Compare</i>Bridgeway Corp. v. Citibank, 45 F. Supp. 2d 276, 285 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (plaintiff has burden to show no mandatory basis under 4(a) for nonrecognition exists; defendant has burden regarding discretionary bases)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>with</i>The Courage Co. LLC v. The ChemShare Corp., 93 S.W.3d 323, 331 (Tex. App. 2002) (party seeking to avoid recognition has burden to prove ground for nonrecognition). Because the grounds for nonrecognition in Section 4 are in the nature of defenses to recognition, the burden of proof is most appropriately allocated to the party opposing recognition of the foreign-country judgment.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Official Comment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Source: This section is new.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Unlike the 1962 Act, which was silent as to the proper procedure for seeking recognition of a foreign-country judgment, Section 6 of this Act expressly sets out the ways in which the issue of recognition may be raised. Under section 6, the issue of recognition always must be raised in a court proceeding. Thus, section 6 rejects decisions under the 1962 Act holding that the registration procedure found in the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act could be utilized with regard to recognition of a foreign-country judgment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>E.g.</i> Society of Lloyd’s v. Ashenden, 233 F.3d 473 (7th Cir. 2000). The Enforcement Act deals solely with the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>enforcement</i> of sister-state judgments and other judgments entitled to full faith and credit, not with the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>recognition</i> of foreign-country judgments.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>More broadly, section 6 rejects the use of any registration procedure in the context of the foreign-country judgments covered by this Act. A registration procedure represents a balance between the interest of the judgment creditor in obtaining quick and efficient recognition and enforcement of a judgment when the judgment debtor has already been provided with an opportunity to litigate the underlying issues, and the interest of the judgment debtor in being provided an adequate opportunity to raise and litigate issues regarding whether the foreign-country judgment should be recognized. In the context of sister-state judgments, this balance favors use of a truncated procedure such as that found in the Enforcement Act. Recognition of sister-state judgments normally is mandated by the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Courts recognize only a very limited number of grounds for denying full faith and credit to a sister-state judgment – that the rendering court lacked jurisdiction, that the judgment was procured by fraud, that the judgment has been satisfied, or that the limitations period has expired. Thus, the judgment debtor with regard to a sister-state judgment normally does not have any grounds for opposing recognition and enforcement of the judgment. The extremely limited grounds for denying full faith and credit to a sister-state judgment reflect the fact such judgments will have been rendered by a court that is subject to the same due process limitations and the same overlap of federal statutory and constitutional law as the forum state’s courts, and, to a large extent, the same body of court precedent and socio-economic ideas as those shaping the law of the forum state. Therefore, there is a strong presumption of fairness and competence attached to a sister-state judgment that justifies use of a registration procedure.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The balance between the benefits and costs of a registration procedure is significantly different, however, in the context of recognition and enforcement of foreign-country judgments. Unlike the limited grounds for denying full faith and credit to a sister-state judgment, this Act provides a number of grounds upon which recognition of a foreign-country judgment may be denied. Determination of whether these grounds apply requires the forum court to look behind the foreign-country judgment to evaluate the law and the judicial system under which the foreign-country judgment was rendered. The existence of these grounds for nonrecognition reflects the fact there is less expectation that foreign-country courts will follow procedures comporting with U.S. notions of fundamental fairness and jurisdiction or that those courts will apply laws viewed as substantively tolerable by U.S. standards than there is with regard to sister-state courts. In some situations, there also may be suspicions of corruption or fraud in the foreign-country proceedings. These differences between sister-state judgments and foreign-country judgments provide a justification for requiring judicial involvement in the decision whether to recognize a foreign-country judgment in all cases in which that issue is raised. Although the threshold for establishing that a foreign-country judgment is not entitled to recognition under Section 4 is high, there is a sufficiently greater likelihood that significant recognition issues will be raised so as to require a judicial proceeding.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. This Section contemplates that the issue of recognition may be raised either as an original matter or in the context of a pending proceeding. Subsection 6(a) provides that in order to raise the issue of recognition of a foreign-country judgment as an initial matter, the party seeking recognition must file an action for recognition of the foreign-country judgment. Subsection 6(b) provides that when the recognition issue is raised in a pending proceeding, it may be raised by counterclaim, cross-claim or affirmative defense, depending on the context in which it is raised. These rules are consistent with the way the issue of recognition most often was raised in most states under the 1962 Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. An action seeking recognition of a foreign-country judgment under this Section is an action on the foreign-country judgment itself, not an action on the underlying cause of action that gave rise to that judgment. The parties to an action under Section 6 may not relitigate the merits of the underlying dispute that gave rise to the foreign-country judgment.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. While this Section sets out the ways in which the issue of recognition of a foreign-country judgment may be raised, it is not intended to create any new procedure not currently existing in the state or to otherwise effect existing state procedural requirements. The parties to an action in which recognition of a foreign-country judgment is sought under Section 6 must comply with all state procedural rules with regard to that type of action. Nor does this Act address the question of what constitutes a sufficient basis for jurisdiction to adjudicate with regard to an action under Section 6. Courts have split over the issue of whether the presence of assets of the debtor in a state is a sufficient basis for jurisdiction in light of footnote 36 of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 210 n.36 (1977). This Act takes no position on that issue.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. In states that have adopted the Uniform Foreign-Money Claims Act, that Act will apply to the determination of the amount of a money judgment recognized under this Act.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Source: The substance of subsection 7(1) is based on Section 3 of the 1962 Act. Subsection 7(2) is new.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Section 5 of this Act sets out the standards for the recognition of foreign-country judgments within the scope of this Act, and places an affirmative duty on the forum court to recognize any foreign-country judgment that meets those standards. Section 6 of this Act sets out the procedures by which the issue of recognition may be raised. This Section sets out the consequences of the decision by the forum court that the foreign-country judgment is entitled to recognition.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Under subsection 7(1), the first consequence of recognition of a foreign-country judgment is that it is treated as conclusive between the parties in the forum state. Section 7(1) does not attempt to establish directly the extent of that conclusiveness. Instead, it provides that the foreign-country judgment is treated as conclusive to the same extent that a judgment of a sister state that had been determined to be entitled to full faith and credit would be conclusive. This means that the foreign-country judgment generally will be given the same effect in the forum state that it has in the foreign country where it was rendered. Subsection 7(1), however, sets out the minimum effect that must be given to the foreign-country judgment once recognized. The forum court remains free to give the foreign-country judgment a greater preclusive effect in the forum state than the judgment would have in the foreign country where it was rendered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Cf.</i>Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, § 481 cmt<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>c</i> (1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Under subsection 7(2), the second consequence of recognition of a foreign-country judgment is that, to the extent it grants a sum of money, it is enforceable in the forum state in accordance with the procedures for enforcement in the forum state and to the same extent that a judgment of the forum state would be enforceable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Cf.</i>Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States § 481 (1986) (judgment entitled to recognition is enforceable in accordance with the procedure for enforcement of judgments applicable where enforcement is sought). Thus, under subsection 7(2), once recognized, the foreign-country judgment has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses and proceedings for reopening, vacating, or staying a judgment of a comparable court in the forum state, and can be enforced or satisfied in the same manner as such a judgment of the forum state.</p>

Under Section 3 of this Act, a foreign-country judgment is not within the scope of this Act unless it is conclusive and enforceable where rendered. Thus, if the effect of appeal under the law of the foreign country in which the judgment was rendered is to prevent it from being conclusive or enforceable between the parties, the existence of a pending appeal in the foreign country would prevent the application of this Act. Section 8 addresses a different situation. It deals with the situation in which either (1) the party seeking a stay has demonstrated that it intends to file an appeal in the foreign country, although the appeal has not yet been filed or (2) an appeal has been filed in the foreign country, but under the law of the foreign country filing of an appeal does not affect the conclusiveness or enforceability of the judgment. Section 8 allows the forum court in those situations to determine in its discretion that a stay of proceedings is appropriate.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Source: This Section is new. The 1962 Act did not contain a statute of limitations. Some courts applying the 1962 Act have used the state’s general statute of limitations, <i>e.g.</i>, Vrozos v. Sarantopoulos, 552 N.E.2d 1053 (Ill. App. 1990) (as Recognition Act contains no statute of limitations, general five-year statute of limitations applies), while others have used the statute of limitations applicable with regard to enforcement of a domestic judgment, <i>e.g.</i>, La Societe Anonyme Goro v. Conveyor Accessories, Inc., 677 N.E. 2d 30 (Ill. App. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Under Section 3 of this Act, this Act only applies to foreign-country judgments that are conclusive, and if the judgment grants recovery of a sum of money, enforceable where rendered. Thus, if the period of effectiveness of the foreign-country judgment has expired in the foreign country where the judgment was rendered, the foreign-country judgment would not be subject to this Act. This means that the period of time during which a foreign-country judgment may be recognized under this Act normally is measured by the period of time during which that judgment is effective (that is, conclusive and, if applicable, enforceable) in the foreign country that rendered the judgment. If, however, the foreign-country judgment remains effective for more than fifteen years after the date on which it became effective in the foreign country, Section 9 places an additional time limit on recognition of a foreign-country judgment. It provides that, if the foreign-country judgment remains effective between the parties for more than fifteen years, then an action to recognize the foreign-country judgment under this Act must be commenced within that fifteen year period.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Section 9 does not address the issue of whether a foreign-country judgment that can no longer be the basis of a recognition action under this Act because of the application of the fifteen-year limitations period in Section 9 may be used for other purposes. For example, a common rule with regard to judgments barred by a statute of limitations is that they still may be used defensively for purposes of offset and for their preclusive effect. The extent to which a foreign-country judgment with regard to which a recognition action is barred by Section 9 may be used for these or other purposes is left to the other law of the forum state.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Section 3 of this Act provides that this Act applies only to certain foreign-country judgments that grant or deny recovery of a sum of money. The purpose of this Act is to establish the minimum standards for recognition of those judgments. Section 11 makes clear that no negative implication should be read from the fact that this Act does not provide for recognition of other foreign-country judgments. Rather, this Act simply does not address the issue of whether foreign-country judgments not within its scope under Section 3 should be recognized. Courts are free to recognize those foreign-country judgments not within the scope of this Act under common law principles of comity or other applicable law.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This Act establishes a registration procedure for recognition and enforcement of Canadian money judgments as an alternative to the procedure found in Section 6 of the Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition Act (UFCMJRA), which requires that recognition be sought through a judicial proceeding. The Act is drafted to supplement and integrate into the UFCMJRA and relies on the rules of the UFCMJRA with regard to recognition of foreign-country money judgments, other than the UFCMJRA requirement that an action be filed. The Act also establishes a registration procedure that is similar, to the extent practicable, to the Canadian registration procedure regarding foreign-country judgments contained in the Canadian Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA).</p>

<p class="p6"><b>History of Section.</b> <br>
P.L. 2021, ch. 134, § 2, effective July 3, 2021; P.L. 2021, ch. 156, § 2, effective July 3, 2021.</p>
<p class="p5">Annotations</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Official Comment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Under subsection (a), this Act applies to a Canadian money judgment to the extent the judgment comes within the scope of the UFCMJRA. Section 3 of the UFCMJRA provides that the UFCMJRA applies to a foreign-country judgment to the extent the judgment (1) grants or denies recovery of a sum of money; and is (2) final, conclusive and enforceable under the law of the rendering jurisdiction. UFCMJRA Section 3 excludes (1) a judgment for taxes; (2) a fine or other penalty; and (3) a judgment for divorce, support, or maintenance, or other judgment in connection with domestic relations. These requirements and exclusions are incorporated into this Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Harmonization with the Canadian UEFJA is only partial with regard to the kind of judgments that are included in the Act. The Canadian UEFJA is not limited to money judgments; it applies more broadly to a final order or judgment in a civil proceeding. The policy decision was made, however, to limit the scope of this Act to judgments that are within the scope of both the UFCMJRA and the Canadian UEFJA. Because the scope of the UFCMJRA is narrower than that of the Canadian UEFJA, the scope of this Act is limited to the scope of the UFCMJRA.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. The Canadian UEFJA contains exclusions for (1) recovery of taxes; (2) maintenance or support; and (3) recovery of monetary fines or penalties that are sufficiently similar to those in Section 3 of the UFCMJRA as to not affect harmonization. The Canadian UEFJA also contains three exclusions not found in the UFCMJRA – foreign judgments: (1) “arising out of bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings”; (2) “that recognize the judgment of another foreign State;” and (3) that were “rendered in proceedings commenced before the coming into force of [the Canadian UEFJA]”. There is no need to address the bankruptcy exclusion in this Act because U.S. bankruptcy law requires that the type of judgment covered by this exclusion – a foreign money judgment against a debtor in bankruptcy or its estate – be filed in the bankruptcy proceedings rather than under the UFCMJRA. The exclusion for a judgment recognizing the judgment of another foreign State is dealt with in this Act by excluding that type of judgment from the definition of “Canadian judgment” in Section 2(2). The third exclusion is addressed in Section 11 of this Act, which provides that the Act applies only to proceedings commenced on or after the effective date of the Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. In addition to limiting the type of judgments to which this Act applies to those within the scope of the UFCMJRA, Section 3(a) provides that the Act applies only “if recognition of the judgment is sought to enforce the judgment.” This latter limit, which is not found in the UFCMJRA, is intended to exclude from the Act situations in which recognition is sought solely for the purpose of obtaining the preclusive effect of the Canadian money judgment. This issue is discussed further in Comments 1 and 2 to Section 4.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Subsections (b) and (c) deal with “mixed judgments” – judgments that are partially within and partially outside of the scope of the Act. The UFCMJRA deals with this issue by providing in UFCMJRA Section 3 that the UFCMJRA applies to mixed judgments “<i>to the extent</i>” they are within its scope. This section also uses the “to the extent” formulation in order to track the scope of the UFCMJRA. In addition, subsections (b) and (c) make it clear that a mixed judgment may be registered to the extent that it involves the type of relief and subject matter that is within the scope of the UFCMJRA and thus within the scope of this Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. A Canadian judgment could contain elements that are within the scope of this Act, and others that are not, in two ways. First, the judgment could combine a monetary award (which would be within the Act’s scope) with a non-monetary award, such as an injunction (which would not be within its scope). <i>See</i> UFCMJRA Section 3(a). Second, the judgment could relate to both a subject matter within the scope of the Act and one that is excluded. <i>See</i> UFCMJRA Section 3(b). Subsection (b) addresses the first situation, providing that a judgment that grants both monetary and non-monetary relief may be registered, but only to the extent of the grant of monetary relief. Subsection (c) addresses the second situation, providing that a judgment rendered with regard to both a subject matter within the scope of the Act and one that is outside its scope may be registered, but only to the extent the judgment relates to the subject matter within the scope of this Act.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Comment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Section 3(a) states the scope of this Act in terms of both the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>type</i> of judgment (this Act applies to a judgment to the extent the judgment is a type of judgment to which the UFCMJRA applies) and in terms of the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>purpose</i> for which recognition is sought (recognition must be sought in order to enforce the judgment). Accordingly, subsection (a) provides that a person may register a Canadian judgment if recognition is sought in order to enforce the judgment – that is, if the person registering the judgment is doing so in order to use available procedures in the state to collect the amount of the judgment from the assets of a person who is obligated to pay the judgment. The registration procedure thus is not available when recognition of a Canadian judgment is sought solely to establish its preclusive effect with regard to the determination of the dispute (or issues in the dispute) by the rendering court. In most instances, the issue of recognition of a foreign judgment solely to establish its preclusive effect will be raised in the course of an already-initiated court proceeding, and, therefore, is best dealt with under the procedures of Section 6 of the UFCMJRA.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. The term “enforce” as used in subsection (a) includes any means provided by the law of this state by which a person may seek to collect the judgment from the assets of the person obligated on the judgment. Enforcement does not necessarily require an affirmative act on the part of the person seeking to collect. For example, in some states, a judgment creates a lien against the judgment debtor’s real estate without any action by the judgment creditor. A person registering a Canadian judgment for the purpose of obtaining this automatic lien would meet the requirement of subsection (a). Subsection (a) also does not affect any of the rules with regard to enforcement of judgments under the law of this state, including the time in which a judgment creditor may enforce a judgment. The requirement that the registration be for the purpose of enforcement does not mean that enforcement must be the sole reason for registration. Indeed, under Section 5, one of the consequences of registration is that the judgment is conclusive between the parties. It is only when recognition is sought<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>solely</i> to obtain preclusive effect that registration is not available. The person against whom the judgment has been registered has the burden of establishing that the judgment was not registered for the purpose of enforcement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>See</i> Section 7.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Subsection (b)(1) is based on Canadian UEFJA Section 12(4)(a), which provides that the appropriate authentication is that of the court of origin.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. While the authentication under subsection (b)(1) is that of the court of origin, the method of authentication is determined by this state as the forum asked to recognize the judgment. The procedure contemplated is that required in this state for the authentication of a foreign-country judgment in connection with an action under UFCMJRA Section 6.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Subsection (b)(2) requires basic information identifying the person registering the Canadian judgment – that is, the person in whose favor the judgment was rendered or a successor in interest to that person. If the person registering the judgment is not the original party in whose favor the judgment was rendered, subsection (b)(3) requires the person registering the judgment to explain why it is entitled to have the judgment recognized and enforced.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Subsection (b)(4) requires basic information about the person against whom the judgment is being registered. The most up-to-date information available to the person registering the judgment is required.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. Subsection (b)(5) addresses the issue of mixed judgments. If the Canadian judgment is only partially within the scope of the Act, the part of the judgment within the Act may be registered, see Section 3, but the person registering the judgment must provide a description of that part.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>8. Subsection (b)(6) requires information about the amount of the judgment for which registration is sought, including the amount of accrued interest, costs and expenses and attorney’s fees. The primary purpose of this information is to allow the person against whom the judgment is registered to determine how the amount of the judgment for which registration is sought was determined and the components that make up that amount. If only part of the judgment is being registered, the person registering the judgment is required to allocate the appropriate amounts to the part being registered.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>9. Subsection (b)(7) requires information about the amount of post-judgment costs, expenses, and attorney’s fees included in the amount for which enforcement of the judgment is sought. The amounts included are “as of the date of registration,” which would include any amount up to the time of filing the registration. Unlike the amounts included under subsection (b)(6), post-judgment amounts claimed are not likely to have been approved by a court. As with regard to other amounts stated in the registration, however, the burden is on the person against whom the judgment is being registered to object to these amounts, if the person believes they are not accurate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>See</i> Section 7(b)(2).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>10. Subsection (b)(8) requires the person registering the judgment to state the amount of the judgment that has been satisfied as of the filing of the registration. The total of the amounts stated in subsections (b)(6) and (7) less the amount stated in (b)(8) should equal the amount for which enforcement is sought. If only a part of the judgment is subject to being registered, then the amount satisfied will be the amount satisfied with regard to the part of the judgment being registered.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>11. This Act does not address the question of the conversion rule to be used with regard to the amounts subsection (b) requires to be stated. In this regard, this Act follows the UFCMJRA, which also leaves this issue to other law of the state. In contrast, compare Canadian UEFJA Section 13, which explicitly adopts the date of payment conversion rule. The date of payment rule also is the conversion rule adopted in the Uniform Foreign-Money Claims Act and the prevalent rule in many other countries. The intent of this Act is that the conversion rule applied will be the same conversion rule as would be used in an action under UFCMJRA Section 6 in this state. Depending on the conversion rule used, the amounts under subsection (b) may in some instances be stated in more than one currency.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>12. Subsection (b)(9) requires the person seeking registration to provide a statement that the judgment to be registered is of a type to which the UFCMJRA (and thus this Act) applies. Under UFCMJRA Section 3(c), the party seeking recognition has the burden to establish that the UFCMJRA applies to the foreign-country judgment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Cf.</i> The Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements of 30 June 2005, Art. 13 1. d) (requiring person seeking recognition of a judgment to produce “any documents necessary to establish that the judgment has effect or, where applicable, is enforceable in the State of origin”). The same is true under this Act.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>See</i> Section 9(a) (except for UFCMJRA Section 6, UFCMJRA rules apply to registration under this Act). If only a portion of the judgment is within the scope of the UFCMJRA (and thus subject to registration under this Act), subsection (b)(9)(C) requires the person registering the judgment to affirm that the amounts stated in the registration pursuant to subsection (b)(6), (7) and (8) relate to the part being registered.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>13. Subsection (b)(10) requires a certified translation of the judgment into English, if the original judgment is not in English. What constitutes an acceptable certification is left to other law of the state. The intent is that what would constitute an acceptable certification of a translation of a Canadian judgment in an action for recognition under UFCMJRA Section 6 also would be an acceptable certification under this Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>14. Subsection (b)(11) requires payment of a registration fee to the Clerk of Court. It is based on Section 5 of the ULC Revised Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (1964) (dealing with registration of sister-state judgments). Payment of this registration fee is a requirement for issuance of a docket number and entry in the docket by the Clerk of Court under subsection (c).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>15. In addition to payment of the registration fee, subsection (c) makes receipt of a registration that includes all the documents and information listed in subsection (b) a requirement for the Clerk of Court to register the judgment, issue a docket number (required under Section 6 to give notice to the person against whom registration of the judgment is sought) and enter the registration in the Court’s registration docket.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>16. Subsection (b) requires that the registration be executed by the person registering the judgment or that person’s attorney. The word “executed” was chosen rather than the word “authenticated” or “signed” in order to avoid any connotation as to whether the requirement can be satisfied by an electronic signature. Whether the court will accept the registration of a Canadian judgment as an electronic filing is left to other law of the state.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>17. Section 4 does not require that the information necessary for registration be provided in any particular form. Subsection (d), however, provides a standard form for registration of a Canadian money judgment under this Act. Use of the form is voluntary; however, its use does provide a safe harbor. Under subsection (d), a registration substantially as provided by the form and including the attachments specified in the form meets the requirements for registration under subsection (b). The form requests certain information that is not required by subsection (b), but which is practical and helpful. This information is marked as “optional” on the form. Failure to provide this optional information does not affect the determination of whether a submission is substantially as provided by the form.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Official Comment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Legislative Note:<i>The state should select between the bracketed terms “garnishment” and “trustee process” depending on how this type of enforcement action is described in state law. If the state uses another term to describe this type of enforcement action, the state should insert that term instead of “garnishment” or “trustee process”.</i></p>
<p class="p7"><b>Comment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. The effect of registration under this Act is that the judgment is considered recognized, subject to a period during which certain means of enforcing the judgment are prohibited in order to provide the person against whom the judgment has been registered an opportunity to raise any defenses that would cause the registration to be vacated. Subsection (a) states the basic rule that a registered judgment is given the same effect as a judgment that has been determined by a court to be entitled to recognition under Section 7 of the UFCMJRA. Thus, once registered, (and subject to the period provided in subsection (b)), a Canadian judgment is (1) conclusive between the parties to the same extent as the judgment of a sister-state entitled to full faith and credit and (2) enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as a judgment rendered in the recognizing state.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>See</i> UFCMJRA § 7. Section 14 of the Canadian UEFJA contains similar provisions, providing that, “[o]n registration, a foreign judgment is enforceable as if it were a judgment of the enforcing court,” and the enforcing court “has the same jurisdiction and control over a registered foreign judgment as it has over its own judgments and may order enforcement in respect of one or more of its parts.”</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Subsection (b) provides that the person registering the judgment may not enforce the judgment by sale or other disposition of property or by seizure or garnishment of property until 31 days after service of notice of the registration on the person against whom the judgment is registered. The intent of this subsection is to provide a period during which a person against whom a judgment has been registered can take action to have the registration vacated before being subject to enforcement acts that could be dispositive with regard to the person’s property. Section 14(3) of the Canadian UEFJA contains an analogous provision, which states that a registered judgment “may not be enforced by the sale or other disposition of any property of the judgment debtor before the expiry of 30 days after the judgment debtor has received notice of the proceedings to register the foreign judgment, or any longer period that the enforcing court may allow.” Harmonization on this issue is not complete, as subsection (b) prohibits enforcement acts that are short of final disposition of the property, but nevertheless may cause irreversible harm to the person against whom the judgment is registered.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Subsection (b) is a crucial provision in establishing an appropriate balance between protecting the person against whom the judgment is registered, who may have a valid defense to recognition of the judgment, and permitting the person registering the judgment to effectively and efficiently enforce its judgment, including avoiding dissipation of assets. Subsection (b) strikes this balance by, first, providing that until 31 days after service of notice of registration, the person registering the judgment may not enforce the registered judgment through disposition, seizure or garnishment of the property of the person against whom the judgment is registered. As discussed above, this prohibition on enforcement actions is broader than that in the Canadian UEFJA, Section 14(3), which only prohibits enforcement through sale or other disposition of the property. Expansion of the protection afforded the person against whom the judgment is registered was warranted because actions short of disposition, such as garnishment of bank accounts, could cause potentially irreversible harm. Subsection (b), however, also provides several protections of the interests of the person registering the judgment. The prohibition on enforcement actions does not prevent all actions related to enforcement, but only those specifically listed. Thus, for example, it does not prohibit discovery seeking information about property that may be available to satisfy the judgment. Nor does it prohibit enforcement activity short of seizure or garnishment, such as placing a lien on the property of the person against whom the judgment is registered. The person registering the judgment, therefore, is not prohibited from establishing its priority to the assets during the 30-day period vis a vis other creditors of the person against whom the judgment is registered. Subsection (b) also provides that the court may shorten the 30-day period (as well as lengthen it) for cause. (Section 14(3) of the Canadian UEFJA only allows the court to lengthen the period.) Finally, subsection (b) does not preclude use of other laws of the state that provide relief against dissipation, disposition or removal of assets potentially available to satisfy the judgment.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Subsection (b) provides that the 30-day period during which certain enforcement acts are prohibited may be shortened or lengthened by the court for cause. Given the varied factual circumstances that will justify altering the period, establishing a specific standard is impracticable. Instead, the standard is left to judicial development. The “for cause” language is intended as a signal to the court that, although the decision to alter the time period is within its discretion, there should be a significant reason for altering the time period. It should not be altered as a matter of course, but only when there are circumstances that justify the lengthening or shortening. This is particularly the case as the 30-day time period in this section normally should coordinate with the 30-day period in Section 7 (a) during which the person against whom the judgment is registered may file a petition to vacate the registration.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Comment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Subsection (a) requires that notice of the registration be served on the person against whom the judgment has been registered. Section 12(4)(b) of the Canadian UEFJA contains an analogous requirement.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. The time of service of notice is a crucial measuring point under this Act. Both the 30-day non-enforcement period in Section 5(b) and the 30-day period in Section 7 (a) during which a person against whom a judgment is registered may file a petition to vacate the registration are measured from the time of service of notice. Prompt and adequate service of notice thus is critical to the ability of the person registering the judgment to enforce the registered judgment.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Registering a Canadian judgment is an alternative to the commencement of a lawsuit for its recognition. Nevertheless, some of the rules that apply to commencement of a lawsuit also apply in the registration context. Subsection (b) provides that the manner in which notice is to be given is the same as that provided by the rules governing service of summons and complaint in an action for recognition of a foreign-country judgment. <i>Cf.</i> Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act of the Province of Alberta, § 6(1)(a) (notice of registration to be served “in the same manner as a statement of claim is required to be served”). The subsection (b) reference to other law for the specific methodology by which notice is given includes not only the rules governing the method of service, but also those concerning other service-related issues, such as the timing of service and the time by which proof of service must be filed with the clerk of court.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. The requirement under subsection (b) that notice of registration be served in the same manner as a summons and complaint normally will result in personal service of the registration notice, and is an important protection for the person against whom the judgment is registered. The requirement also harmonizes the Act with Canadian law on this issue. Registration under both the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Acts and the Canadian UEFJA requires personal service. The rationales for requiring personal service in Canada are that (1) registration is the commencement of a new process rather than a corollary to an existing one in the enforcing jurisdiction, (2) because the person against whom the judgment is registered can object to registration and enforcement, that person should receive personal notice of the intended action, and (3) personal service is the best way to establish when the timelines in the registration process commence. The rationales for the Canadian personal service requirement and the desire to maintain parity between the Canadian and U.S. registration procedures to the extent practicable, provide additional reasons for the personal service requirement in subsection (b).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Subsection (c) lists the information that must be included in the notice of registration, including information regarding the registration and the person registering the judgment. Subsection (c)(4) requires that a copy of the registration, including a copy of the documents required to be filed with the registration under Section 4(b), must be included with the notice. Subsection (c)(5) requires that a statement be included in the notice informing the person against whom the judgment has been registered that the person has 30 days after service in which to petition the court to vacate the registration, subject to the court’s ability to alter that time period for cause.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Subsection (d) requires that proof of service of the notice of registration be filed with the clerk of court. The time by which the proof of service must be filed is one of the issues left to the rules governing service of a summons and complaint under subsection (b). <i>See</i> comment 2.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Comment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. A primary consequence of a registration process for recognition of Canadian judgments is that it shifts the burden of invoking judicial scrutiny of the foreign judgment from the person seeking recognition of the judgment to the person seeking to avoid recognition. This section provides the procedure by which the person seeking to avoid recognition can invoke that judicial scrutiny. It provides that the person seeking to avoid recognition through registration may file a petition with the court within 30 days after service of notice of registration, stating its objections to recognition of the judgment by registration. The effect of filing a petition to vacate the registration is to invoke the judicial process for ultimate determination of whether the Canadian judgment will be registered, and, if the basis for vacating the registration is that the judgment is not entitled to recognition on a ground found in the UFCMJRA, for determination of whether the judgment is entitled to be recognized in accordance with the UFCMJRA as well. <i>See</i> subsection (e) and comment 8 below. Once a petition to vacate the registration is filed, the case will move forward as a matter to be determined by the court.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Subsection (a) requires that a petition to vacate the registration be filed with the court no later than 30 days after the person against whom the judgment is registered is served with notice under Section 6. The court may shorten or lengthen the filing period for cause. Given the varied factual circumstances that will justify altering the period, establishing a specific standard is impracticable. Instead, the standard is left to judicial development. The “for cause” language is intended as a signal to the court that, although the decision to alter the time period is within its discretion, there should be a significant reason for altering the time period. It should not be altered as a matter of course, but only when there are circumstances that justify the lengthening or shortening. This is particularly the case as the 30-day time period in this section normally should coordinate with the 30-day period in Section 5(b) during which certain enforcement actions against the property of the person against whom the judgment is registered are prohibited.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Subsection (b) divides the grounds upon which a registration may be vacated into two categories. Under subsection (b)(1), a judgment debtor may assert as a basis for vacating the registration any ground that could be asserted to deny recognition to the Canadian judgment under the UFCMJRA. Given the “plug in” relationship of this Act to the UFCMJRA, subsection (b)(1) references the grounds for refusing recognition under the UFCMJRA rather than restating them. The defenses to recognition of a foreign-country judgment under the UFCMJRA are contained in UFCMJRA Section 4. Under this section, those defenses also are available to vacate registration of the judgment.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In addition to the UFCMJRA Section 4 defenses to recognition (which provide the only substantive grounds for denying recognition), there are other grounds for denying recognition under the UFCMJRA, and those grounds also are available to the person against whom the Canadian judgment has been registered under subsection (b)(1). For example, another ground for denying recognition to a judgment under the UFCMJRA is that the judgment is not one to which the UFCMJRA applies under UFCMJRA Section 3. Section 3 of this Act provides that this Act applies to a Canadian judgment to the extent the judgment is within the scope of the UFCMJRA; therefore, if a judgment does not come within the scope of UFCMJRA Section 3, it also cannot be registered under this Act. (Canadian judgments not within the scope of the UFCMJRA, and thus not within the scope of this Act, of course, still can be recognized by a court under principles of comity or other applicable law. See UFCMJRA Section 11.) A third ground for denying recognition to a judgment under the UFCMJRA is that the action is barred by the statute of limitations found in UFCMJRA Section 9. This ground also would be available under this section as a basis to vacate registration of the judgment. As these examples illustrate, the intent of subsection (b)(1) is to allow the person against whom registration is sought to raise as a ground for vacating the registration any ground that would be available in this state as a basis for denying recognition to the judgment under the UFCMJRA.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The following examples illustrate the application of subsection (b)(1):</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><b>Example 1.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> Judgment Creditor registers a Canadian judgment against Judgment Debtor under Section 4 of this Act. Judgment Debtor files a timely petition to vacate the registration under this section on the ground that the Canadian court rendering the judgment did not have personal jurisdiction over Judgment Debtor. Under subsection (b)(1), Judgment Debtor may assert as a basis for vacating the registration any ground that could be asserted to deny recognition to the judgment under the UFCMJRA. UFCMJRA Section 4(b)(2) provides that a court “may not recognize a foreign-country judgment if … the foreign court did not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant … .” Therefore, Judgment Debtor may assert lack of personal jurisdiction as a basis for vacating the registration. Further, if the court finds that the Canadian court did not have personal jurisdiction over Judgment Debtor, the court <i>must</i> vacate the registration because UFCMJRA Section 4(b)(2) makes denial of recognition mandatory when the court finds a lack of personal jurisdiction. In addition, under subsection (e) of this section, the court must enter a judgment denying recognition to the Canadian judgment, and the judgment denying recognition will have the same effect as a judgment denying recognition to a foreign judgment for lack of personal jurisdiction under the UFCMJRA – that is, the Canadian judgment will not be recognized in the state.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><b>Example 2.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> Judgment Creditor registers a Canadian judgment against Judgment Debtor under Section 4 of this Act. Judgment Debtor files a timely petition to vacate the registration under this section on the ground that the Canadian judgment is characterized as a domestic relations judgment under U.S. law and thus is not a judgment to which the UFCMJRA, and, therefore, this Act applies. Section 3 of this Act provides that this Act applies to a Canadian judgment to the extent the judgment is within the scope of UFCMJRA Section 3. UFCMJRA Section 3(b)(3) provides that the UFCMJRA “does not apply to a foreign-country judgment . . . to the extent that the judgment is . . . a judgment for divorce, support, or maintenance, or other judgment rendered in connection with domestic relations.” The fact a judgment is a domestic relations judgment thus is a ground for denying recognition to the judgment under the UFCMJRA. Therefore, under subsection (b)(1) of this section, it also is a ground for vacating the registration of the judgment. In addition, under subsection (e) of this section, the court must enter a judgment denying recognition to the Canadian judgment, and the court’s judgment denying recognition will have the same effect as a judgment denying recognition to a foreign judgment under the UFCMJRA on the ground that the foreign judgment is not within the scope of the UFCMJRA. UFCMJRA Section 11 provides that the UFCMJRA “does not prevent the recognition under principles of comity or otherwise of a foreign-country judgment not within the scope” of the UFCMJRA. Thus, the judgment rendered by the court under subsection (e) would prevent Judgment Creditor from seeking recognition of the judgment under the UFCMJRA or registering the Canadian judgment under this Act, but would not prevent Judgment Creditor from seeking recognition of the judgment under principles of comity or other applicable law, such as, for example, the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (2008), if the Canadian judgment is one that fits within the scope of that Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Subsection (b)(2) provides that a judgment debtor also may seek to have the registration vacated based on the failure of the person registering the judgment to comply with the requirements for registration under this Act. <i>See</i> Sections 4 and 6. While the subsection (b)(1) grounds for setting aside the registration relate to whether the Canadian judgment should be recognized at all (at least under the UFCMJRA), the subsection (b)(2) grounds for vacating the registration relate only to whether the person registering the judgment properly followed the registration process. For example, Section 4(a) requires that the person seeking recognition of a Canadian judgment through registration must do so for the purpose of enforcing the judgment. If recognition is sought solely for the preclusive effect of the judgment, then the registration procedure cannot be used. The judgment still may be entitled to recognition; the registration procedure simply is not the proper procedure by which to obtain that recognition. <i>See</i> Section 9(d)(2).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. U.S. courts consistently have held that a person opposing recognition may not seek to re-litigate the merits of the underlying case that lead to the judgment for which recognition is sought. Similarly, a person seeking to vacate registration of a Canadian judgment may not seek to relitigate the merits of the underlying case as a basis for vacating the registration.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Subsection (c) states that filing a petition to vacate the registration does not automatically stay enforcement of the registered judgment. Instead, in order to stay all enforcement activities until the petition to vacate the registration is determined (including those listed in Section 5(b) beyond the 30-day period), the person against whom the judgment was registered must request a stay of enforcement from the court under Section 8.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. Subsection (d) states the effect of a court determination that the registration should be vacated – the registration is vacated, and any acts that have been taken under the registration to collect the judgment are void.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>8. Subsection (e) provides that, if a registration is vacated on the basis that the Canadian judgment is not entitled to recognition on a ground upon which recognition would be denied under the UFCMJRA, then, in addition to vacating the registration, the court shall issue a judgment denying recognition to the Canadian judgment. As discussed in comment 3 above, the subsection (b)(1) grounds for vacating a registration are the same as the grounds for denying recognition to a Canadian judgment under the UFCMJRA. Therefore, if the court finds that one of those grounds exists, the result is not only that the registration is vacated, but also that recognition of the Canadian judgment is denied. Subsection (e) further provides that a judgment denying recognition on a subsection (b)(1) ground has the same effect as a judgment denying recognition on the same ground under the UFCMJRA.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Under Section 7(c), the filing of a petition to vacate a registration does not of itself stay enforcement of the judgment.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. The standard to grant a stay pending determination of a petition to vacate a registration is a showing by the person requesting the stay of a likelihood of success on the merits with regard to one of the grounds for vacating a registration listed in Section 7(b). The grounds stated in Section 7(b) are the only grounds upon which a registration may be vacated; therefore, a showing of a likelihood of success with regard to one of these grounds provides the appropriate standard for staying enforcement activities pending the determination of a petition to vacate a registration. If the person requesting the stay meets the standard, then the court shall grant the stay.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. In an appropriate circumstance, the court may require security pending determination of the petition. Whether to require security and the amount of any security required are within the discretion of the court.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Legislative Note:<i>“Petition” is bracketed in subsection (d). The state should insert the appropriate term in the state for a request for relief from a judgment.</i></p>
<p class="p7"><b>Comment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Subsection (a) states the relationship between this Act and the UFCMJRA. The conceptual approach in drafting this Act is to create a “module” that will “plug in” to the provisions of the UFCMJRA. This approach means that the provisions contained in the UFCMJRA need not be restated in this Act, as those provisions will apply equally to this Act. The only exception to this rule is Section 6 of the UFCMJRA. Unlike Section 6 of the UFCMJRA, this Act does not require that the person seeking recognition of a Canadian judgment file a court action. Therefore, Section 6 of the UFCMJRA does not apply to this Act. In providing for application of the rules of the UFCMJRA, the intent of this section is that all of those rules (other than Section 6) will apply, including not only substantive rules, but also other provisions, such as those dealing with allocation of burdens of proof and limitation of actions.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. This Act is intended to provide an alternative procedure to the filing of an action under UFCMJRA Section 6 with regard to Canadian judgments. It does not prevent a person seeking recognition of a Canadian judgment from choosing to file an action seeking recognition as provided in UFCMJRA Section 6 rather than using this Act. The import of subsection (b) is that a person may seek recognition of a Canadian judgment either by registering it under this Act or by commencing a court action under Section 6 of the UFCMJRA. <i>Cf.</i> Revised Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (1964), Section 6 (dealing with registration of sister-state judgments) (“[t]he right of a judgment creditor to bring an action to enforce his judgment instead of proceeding under this Act remains unimpaired.”).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Subsection (c) states the corollary to subsection (b) – a person must choose between the two means of seeking recognition of a Canadian judgment; both procedures may not be pursued at the same time against the same person with regard to the same judgment, or, in the case of a mixed judgment, the same portion of a judgment, in the same jurisdiction. To provide otherwise would lead to inefficiency and waste of judicial resources. Subsection (c), however, does not prevent a person from pursuing different procedures within this state for recognition of a judgment with regard to different persons obligated on the judgment. Subsection (c) also does not prevent the use of different procedures (registration or filing an action for recognition) in different states with regard to the same judgment or part of a judgment.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Subsection (c) is subject to the limited exception found in subsection (d). Under subsection (d), when a registration is vacated solely because of a failure to comply with a requirement for registration under this Act (<i>see</i> Section 7(b)(2)), the person whose registration was vacated is not precluded from further efforts to obtain recognition of the judgment. Instead, subsection (d) gives the person whose registration was vacated a choice – it may either file a new registration (assuming the defect in the previous registration is one that can be cured) or file an action under Section 6 of the UFCMJRA seeking recognition of the Canadian judgment.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Section 3 of this Act provides that the Act applies to a Canadian judgment that is within the scope of the UFCMJRA, if registration is sought for the purpose of enforcement. Thus, the registration procedure under this Act is available with regard to any Canadian judgment that could be considered for recognition through an action filed under the UFCMJRA, if the requirements for registration (including the requirement that recognition of the judgment through registration is being sought for the purpose of enforcing the judgment) are met. The corollary is that judgments not within the scope of the UFCMJRA are not within the scope of this Act. Those judgments continue to be recognized and enforced as they have been prior to this Act. Section 11 of the UFCMJRA states with regard to judgments not within its scope (and thus not within the scope of this Act) that they may be recognized “under principles of comity or otherwise.”</p>

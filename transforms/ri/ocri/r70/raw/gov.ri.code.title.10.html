<p class="p6">Whenever a nuisance is alleged to exist, the attorney general or any citizen of the state may bring an action in the name of the state, upon the relation of the attorney general or of an individual citizen, to abate the nuisance and to perpetually enjoin the person or persons maintaining the nuisance and any or all persons owning any legal or equitable interest in the place from further maintaining or permitting the nuisance either directly or indirectly. The complaint shall be duly sworn to by the complaining party, unless brought by the attorney general, and shall set forth the names of the parties, the object of the action, a description of the place complained of, and a statement of the facts constituting the alleged nuisance.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The remedy set forth in this section is neither exclusive nor mandatory and proceeding to declare nuisance need not comply with this section. Pucci v. Algiere, 106 R.I. 411, 261 A.2d 1, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 939 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>However grave the problem of lead poisoning is in Rhode Island, public nuisance law simply does not provide a remedy for this harm. The state has not and cannot allege facts that would fall within the parameters of what would constitute public nuisance under Rhode Island law. Defendant manufacturers were not in control of any lead pigment at the time the lead caused harm to children in Rhode Island, making defendants unable to abate the alleged nuisance, the standard remedy in a public nuisance action. State v. Lead Indus. Ass'n, 951 A.2d 428, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 79 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The burden of proving a nuisance is upon the party alleging it, who must demonstrate the existence of the nuisance and that injury has been caused by the nuisance complained of. Citizens for Preservation of Waterman Lake v. Davis, 420 A.2d 53, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1833 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Contingent Fee Agreements.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action imposing liability on former lead pigment manufacturers for creating a public nuisance, contingent fee agreements between the Attorney General and outside counsel would not violate Rhode Island Law. After a court had performed the function of reviewing and approving such a fee, allowing the requisite fee to be paid to the contingent fee counsel, the resulting balance would then be turned over to the General Treasury. State v. Lead Indus. Ass'n, 951 A.2d 428, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 79 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Elements.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Negligence is not a necessary element of a nuisance case involving contamination of public or private waters by pollutants percolating through the soil and traveling underground routes. Wood v. Picillo, 443 A.2d 1244, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 833 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There are three principal elements that are essential to establish public nuisance: (1) an unreasonable interference; (2) with a right common to the general public; and (3) by a person or people with control over the instrumentality alleged to have created the nuisance when the damage occurred. After establishing the presence of the three elements of public nuisance, one must then determine whether the defendant caused the public nuisance. State v. Lead Indus. Ass'n, 951 A.2d 428, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 79 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Nuisance.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Liability for nuisance is imposed only in those cases in which the harm or risk to one is greater than he ought to be required to bear under the circumstances. Citizens for Preservation of Waterman Lake v. Davis, 420 A.2d 53, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1833 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Actionable nuisances fall into two classifications, public and private. Citizens for Preservation of Waterman Lake v. Davis, 420 A.2d 53, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1833 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public; it is behavior that unreasonably interferes with the health, safety, peace, comfort or convenience of the general community. Citizens for Preservation of Waterman Lake v. Davis, 420 A.2d 53, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1833 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A private nuisance involves an interference with the use and enjoyment of land. It involves a material interference with the ordinary physical comfort or the reasonable use of one’s property. Citizens for Preservation of Waterman Lake v. Davis, 420 A.2d 53, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1833 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Noise in and of itself can be a nuisance only if it unreasonably interferes with a person’s use and enjoyment of his property. Citizens for Preservation of Waterman Lake v. Davis, 420 A.2d 53, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1833 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Gas company’s argument that a landowner was precluded from seeking abatement or other injunctive relief for contamination of his property by hazardous substances when the contamination violated state environmental laws was not supported by either logic or law;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-1-1 expressly permitted a private citizen to seek abatement or injunctive relief in an action for nuisance and state environmental laws<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>were not intended to preempt that right.

<p class="p6">When clearly written and expressed, a provision in a written contract to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract, or out of the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing between two (2) or more persons to submit to arbitration any controversy existing between them at the time of the agreement to submit shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract; provided, however, that the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to collective contracts between employers and employees, or between employers and associations of employees, in respect to terms or conditions of employment; and provided further, that in all contracts of primary insurance, wherein the provision for arbitration is not placed immediately before the testimonium clause or the signature of the parties, the arbitration procedure may be enforced at the option of the insured, and in the event the insured exercises the option to arbitrate, then the provisions of this chapter shall apply and be the exclusive remedy available to the insured.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Clearly Expressed Agreements.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the plaintiff did not sign or return the confirmation letter purporting to contain the agreement to arbitrate, there was no clearly expressed agreement to arbitrate mutually assented to by both parties; the retention of the confirmation letter by the plaintiff, without more, is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement of an express and unequivocal agreement to arbitrate. Stanley-Bostitch, Inc. v. Regenerative Envtl. Equip. Co., 697 A.2d 323, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 219 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was nothing in the record that objectively manifested the intention that both parties were mutually bound by a clearly expressed and written arbitration clause as was required under § 10-3-2; therefore, in the absence of a valid arbitration agreement, plaintiff could not be required to submit to arbitration proceedings. A.T. Cross Co. v. Royal Selangor(s) PTE, LTD, 217 F. Supp. 2d 229, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16650 (D.R.I. 2002).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the defendant’s confirmation order purporting to contain the arbitration provision operated as an acceptance of the plaintiff’s purchase order within the meaning of subsection (1) of § 6A-2-207, and since under subsection (2) of § 6A-2-207 new terms become part of the contract between the parties unless objected to or unless the new terms materially alter the terms of the bargain, the arbitration provision did not become part of the contract because a provision compelling a party to submit to binding arbitration material alters the terms of the parties agreement.

The agreement contained a clause with a specific termination date and a date by which a notice of non-renewal had to be sent, and the more specific clause containing the termination date took precedence over the parties’ non-specific arbitration clause in which they had agreed to arbitrate “all disputes.” Radiation Oncology Assocs. v.

The attorney-client relationship might well have had an undue influence on the neutral arbitrator, and the attorney-client relationship also gave rise to a rebuttable presumption, which was not rebutted, that there was a causal nexus between the conduct of the provider’s arbitrator and the majority’s low assessment of damages.

At the time of the commencement of the action, or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff must file a motion in the court having jurisdiction for authority to attach the defendant’s assets, including his or her personal or real estate, and the attachment motion must state the day, time and place of hearing and a copy must be served by the process server on the defendant or by leaving it at his or her last and usual place of abode with some person there at least five (5) days before the fixed date of hearing.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> If the defendant does not reside in the state, service of the attachment motion shall be made upon him or her by mailing a copy of the motion to attach, by certified mail, to his or her last known address and, if service is made in this manner, the plaintiff or his or her attorney must attach the sender’s receipt to an affidavit of compliance with this section by the plaintiff or his or her attorney and filing it with the case in the court.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> If the plaintiff after diligent search and by affidavit avers that he or she does not know of the defendant’s address, service on the defendant of the motion to attach may after order of the court be made by publication in some public newspaper, once, published in the town, city or county where the defendant’s assets are situated. If there is no public newspaper published in the town, city or county where the defendant’s assets are situated, then in some public newspaper published in the city of Providence. Provided, however, that in all actions where the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant has been reduced to a judgment, the defendant’s assets, including his or her personal estate and real estate, may be attached and may be subject to trustee process as set out in chapter 17 of this title in the same action in which the judgment has been entered.</p>

<p class="p6">Whenever a member of the division of sheriffs shall take a bond for the release of goods and chattels attached on an original writ or a writ of mesne process, in which the ad damnum shall be more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), the bond shall be in the penal sum of the amount of damages stated in the writ, with some surety company authorized to do business in this state as surety, unless the defendant can furnish as surety a resident of the state satisfactory to the officer taking the bond, who is the owner of real estate in this state having a value over all incumbrances thereon, equal to the penal sum of the amount of damages stated in the writ. In case the owner of such real estate is accepted as surety, the bond shall contain a description of the real estate, so that the real estate may be readily identified in the records of land evidence of the city or town in which it is situated, and also a statement by the surety of the value of the real estate free from all incumbrances, and the description and the valuation shall be sworn to by the surety, and his or her affidavit shall be made a part of the bond. Before the goods and chattels are released, an attested copy of the bond shall be filed with the recorder of deeds, but if there is no recorder of deeds, then with a city or town clerk of the city or town in which the real estate is situated, and the copy shall be recorded in the same manner as copies of writs of attachment are recorded under the provisions of this chapter, and the bond shall be a lien upon the real estate described in the bond until the action in which the attachment was made is disposed of, or the bond is cancelled by the plaintiff, or by his or her attorney of record, or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. The officer taking the bond shall be allowed a fee of one dollar and fifty cents ($1.50) for making a copy of the bond, and the fee for the copy, together with the fee for recording, shall be a part of the costs in the case. Any lien created by the provisions of this section may be established, foreclosed, and enforced by a civil action, which action may be heard, tried, and determined according to the usages in chancery and the principles of equity.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where case is in federal court under diversity of citizenship, federal court is bound by state statute of limitations, and in construing this statute (as it read prior to amendment in 1960) the court held that the filing of third party complaint, under rule 14 of the federal rules of civil procedure, against the alleged joint tortfeasor, when summons was served on third party defendant, fulfills the function of notice and is deemed commencement of an action for contribution tolling the period of limitation, whether or not the state courts would permit the filing of an independent complaint against a joint tortfeasor alleged to be contingently liable for contribution.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is a verbatim enactment of section four of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act of 1939. Augustine v. Langlais, 121 R.I. 802, 402 A.2d 1187, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2055 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is free of ambiguity and must be literally applied. Augustine v. Langlais, 121 R.I. 802, 402 A.2d 1187, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2055 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Joint tortfeasors who were not liable for the total amount of the losses sustained by the failure of a credit union were not entitled to a reduction equal to or greater than the total amount of the contribution demanded by a release and settlement agreement, but only to a proportional share. Paradis v. Central Credit Union, 680 A.2d 70, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 216 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Effect of Settlement on Liability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining prejudgment interest where one tortfeasor has settled, the settlement amount must be deducted from the verdict before prejudgment interest is computed. In this way the nonsettling tortfeasor is not forced to pay interest on the amount of settlement. Margadonna v. Otis Elevator Co., 542 A.2d 232, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 56 (R.I. 1988), limited, Merrill v. Trenn, 706 A.2d 1305, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Absent any alleged liability for monetary contribution, a tortfeasor could not maintain a third-party action against joint tortfeasor who was released by the plaintiff. Cooney v. Molis, 640 A.2d 527, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 121 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A defendant is not precluded from bringing a proper appeal of a jury’s apportionment of liability by the fact that there was a settling joint tortfeasor. Cooney v. Molis, 640 A.2d 527, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 121 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The presence of a settling tortfeasor in trial is not necessary to present a tortfeasor’s claim in an adversarial context, since the power of subpoena remains as a tool to present testimony by the settling tortfeasor to the jury. Cooney v. Molis, 640 A.2d 527, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 121 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When parties settle without reference to any release given to an earlier settling tortfeasor, prejudgment interest is computed as follows: the later settling defendant is charged with interest on the entire amount of damages from the date on which the plaintiff’s cause of action arose to the date of payment by an earlier settling tortfeasor; the plaintiff’s total damages then are reduced by the amount of the earlier payment and the later settling defendant is charged with interest on the reduced balance of the remaining damages for the period from the date of the earlier payment to the date of entry of judgment; then, the interest charged for both periods is added together and the sum added to the remaining tortfeasor’s post-reduction damages liability. Merrill v. Trenn, 706 A.2d 1305, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, in a medical malpractice action against a physician, hospital and manufacturer, the hospital settled with the plaintiffs prior to the conclusion of their case in chief, the trial justice erred by failing to instruct the jury that the liability of the other defendants was reduced by the settlement amount.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Legislature intended the $250,000 minimum-damages provision of the Wrongful Death Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-7-2, to apply on a per-claim, rather than per-defendant, basis; rather than separately apply the statutory minimum to each defendant, the Wrongful Death Act meshes with R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-6-7 such that the Wrongful Death Act is subject to joint and several liability principles. O'Connell v. Walmsley, 156 A.3d 422, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. 2017).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fundamental doctrine that an injured person is entitled to only one satisfaction of the tort, even though two or more parties contributed to the loss was not altered by the enactment of this section which proscribes double recovery by unequivocally mandating that a release “reduces the claim against the other tort feasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release.” Augustine v. Langlais, 121 R.I. 802, 402 A.2d 1187, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2055 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section clearly directs that the damage award must be reduced by either the amount of consideration paid for the release, or the proportion of reduction provided by the release, whichever is greater. Augustine v. Langlais, 121 R.I. 802, 402 A.2d 1187, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2055 (1979).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Application.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This statute is inapplicable to a suit for wrongful death against the United States where the federal court characterized the damage provisions as partly punitive because under the Federal Tort Claims Act recovery of punitive damages is not allowed. D'Ambra v. United States, 481 F.2d 14, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9528 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1075, 94 S. Ct. 592, 38 L. Ed. 2d 482, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 1697 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Award Consistent With Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action for wrongful death the ultimate award was based on a series of predictions, none of which involved absolute certainty, by the jury and if the award was a reasonable response to the evidence and the decision of the trial justice affirming the verdict neither misconceived nor misconstrued any material evidence, the award would not be disturbed. Romano v. Duke, 111 R.I. 459, 304 A.2d 47, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1228 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Computation of Damages.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In awarding damages for wrongful death future income taxes assessed to decedent’s potential earnings must be considered. Turcotte v. Ford Motor Co., 494 F.2d 173, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10076 (1st Cir. 1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even in cases not concerning wrongful death, predictions of wage growth due to economic trends may be admissible if the trial justice considers the information material and relevant to the issue of damages in a particular case. Markham v. Cross Transp., 119 R.I. 213, 376 A.2d 1359, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1899 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature intended to include in the computation of decedent’s prospective income or earnings income that was not only earned before but also received during retirement. Pray v. Narragansett Improvement Co., 434 A.2d 923, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1262 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pension and social security income are part of a decedent’s earnings. Pray v. Narragansett Improvement Co., 434 A.2d 923, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1262 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Loss of Consortium.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By its plain meaning this section encompasses purely economic damages to the decedent, whereas the plain language of § 10-7-1.2 allows for the bringing of a claim for loss of consortium where a preexisting relationship between decedent and survivor is relevant to recovery. Sindelar v. Leguia, 750 A.2d 967, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 115 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence of Prospective Earnings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though plaintiffs did not introduce expert testimony on the issue of the decedent’s prospective earnings, there was sufficient evidence for the case to go to the jury on the issue of damages. Taft v. Cerwonka, 433 A.2d 215, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1241 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Life Expectancy.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Life expectancy is not the same as work expectancy. Pray v. Narragansett Improvement Co., 434 A.2d 923, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1262 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Personal Expenses Defined.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To ascertain damages receivable in an action for wrongful death, the term personal expenses referred to in the deductions was defined as what the deceased would have to lay out, as a producer, to render the service or to acquire the money he might be expected to produce and plaintiffs’ argument that the 1971 amendment allowed a deduction only for deceased’s living expenses lacked logic and overlooked the legislative intent.

<p class="p7"><b>Equitable Adoption.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although an adoptive father’s death prior to the formal adoption of a child satisfies one of the five elements required to establish equitable adoption for purposes of the wrongful death statute, the factual issues which needed to be determined by a jury as to the other four elements precluded the granting of a motion for summary judgment on that issue. Crawford v. Cooper/T. Smith Stevedoring Co., 14 F. Supp. 2d 202, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11906 (D.R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Illustrative Cases.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As a decedent’s son lacked sufficient expert testimony to establish his medical negligence and wrongful death claims, he did not have a viable claim under R.I.

<p class="p7"><b>Prospective Application.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is evident from the language that that portion of the amendment allowing recovery for spousal loss of consortium is intended to be applied prospectively rather than retroactively. It was therefore improper for the trial justice to apply this amendment to a cause of action that accrued in June 1980, four years prior to the effective date of the amendment. Cobe v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Increase in minimum-recovery amount from $5,000 to $25,000, effected by 1980 amendment, was substantive rather than procedural or remedial, and thus such change must be applied prospectively. Dempsey v. State, 451 A.2d 273, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1063 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Legislature intended the $250,000 minimum-damages provision of R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-7-2 to apply on a per-claim, rather than per-defendant, basis. O'Connell v. Walmsley, 156 A.3d 422, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant driver was not individually liable for the statutory minimum of this section because the previous releases of the other tortfeasors in excess of the statutory minimum reduced the claim against defendant. O'Connell v. Walmsley, 156 A.3d 422, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because application of the statutory construction principle—that words importing the singular number may be extended or applied to several persons or things—would not lead to a construction inconsistent with the manifest intent of the General Assembly, or be repugnant to some other part of the statute, indeed, quite the opposite, the minimum-damages provision of section 10-7-2 applies to multiple actors, despite its reference to “he, she, or it.” O'Connell v. Walmsley, 156 A.3d 422, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, which prioritizes compensating the deceased’s family for its loss, does not differentiate as to how many defendants caused the loss; whether the decedent’s death was caused by one tortfeasor or multiple tortfeasors, the act’s remedial goal, and the amount of loss endured by the estate, remain the same. O'Connell v. Walmsley, 156 A.3d 422, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rather than separately apply the statutory minimum to each defendant, the Wrongful Death Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-7-2, meshes with R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-6-7 such that the Wrongful Death Act is subject to joint and several liability principles. O'Connell v. Walmsley, 156 A.3d 422, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. 2017).</p>

This would give the city or the town additional time in which to file an answer to the complaint or to respond to any requests for discovery. In this way the city or the town would avoid any more than minimal expense in responding to the action while considering whether the claim or demand should be paid, and the plaintiff can still fall within the statute of limitations.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The existence of different limitation periods for suits for negligence and for wrongful death does not violate the equal protection rights of tort victims who die from their injuries, since there is a clear distinction between the nature of the plaintiffs involved which fully supports the state’s decision to treat the two types of plaintiff differently, i.e., the personal injury plaintiff’s initial need to recover from his injuries and to know the extent of his injuries, the likelihood of the community-disturbing event of death prompting more immediate focus by third parties upon the cause thereof, and the interest of both the survivors and the state in prompt settlement of the affairs of a deceased.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Action was improperly denominated a habeas corpus proceeding where relief sought was an injunction against further interference with wife’s right to visit relatives rather than a release from unlawful detention. Granger v. Johnson, 117 R.I. 440, 367 A.2d 1062, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1709 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This chapter, in speaking of “any writ of habeas corpus,” is referring to the Great Writ or writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum. Therefore, a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum does not come within the reach of this chapter. State v. Grieco, 430 A.2d 412, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1150 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Availability of Writ.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inmate’s appeal of a judgment denying him a writ of habeas corpus could not be considered because the inmate had been imprisoned as a result of a final judgment of conviction so that habeas corpus was not available to him and because the appeal was untimely under R.I.

<p class="p7"><b>Nature of Custody.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One who is admitted to bail after the filing of his application for a writ of habeas corpus is still in constructive custody and, therefore, entitled to a writ of habeas corpus if such custody is unlawful.

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This chapter’s substitution of one remedy for another is a change of procedure only, not in substance. Palmigiano v. Mullen, 119 R.I. 363, 377 A.2d 242, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1909 (1977); State v. Duggan, 414 A.2d 788, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1637 (R.I. 1980); State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1840 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This statute now provides the exclusive remedy to be utilized for appropriate collateral attack upon a criminal conviction on any ground of alleged error heretofore available under common-law statutory post-conviction remedies. Mastracchio v. Houle, 416 A.2d 116, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1654 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In this jurisdiction applications for post-conviction relief are civil in nature. Waz v. Estate of Judge, 417 A.2d 326, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1727 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because defendant’s sentence was neither illegal nor unconstitutional, a hearing justice erred in ordering resentencing when it granted defendant’s application for postconviction relief pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-1(a)(1). Pelletier v. State, 882 A.2d 567, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 168 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Petitioner’s claim that the postconviction justice failed to follow procedure set forth in <i>Shatney v. State, </i>755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000), before permitting his counsel to withdraw lacked merit; the petitioner was permitted to submit to the court two <i>pro se </i>memoranda to supplement the application for postconviction relief and the petitioner was given an opportunity to speak on his own behalf at all three hearings. Thornton v. State, 948 A.2d 312, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 71 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Hearing justice properly denied defendant’s application for postconviction relief although the State wrongfully failed to disclose under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 16 the uncharged crimes of a witness. There was no reasonable probability that, had the evidence been properly disclosed, the result of the trial would have been different because it could not have escaped the jury’s attention that the witness had an extensive criminal background, that the witness had decided to testify against members of organized crime, that the witness was recently such a member himself, and that the witness hoped to receive protection and avoid incarceration in exchange for his testimony. DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 114 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court did not err in denying an applicant’s petition for postconviction relief because the evidence the State presented at trial was sufficient to convict the applicant; the hearing justice repeatedly made reference to the overwhelming evidence of the applicant’s guilt and, in particular, to the three separate witnesses to the crime that sufficiently identified him as the perpetrator. Spratt v. State, 41 A.3d 984, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 45 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court did not err in denying an applicant’s petition for postconviction relief because the applicant failed to show that any discovery violation under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(4) occurred since there was no error in the hearing justice’s determination that the witness’s identification of the applicant was not based on any identification from a photograph but was based on the witness having seen the crime; because of the abundant evidence of the applicant’s guilt, even if the State produced his arrest photographs during trial, such production would not have avoided his conviction. Spratt v. State, 41 A.3d 984, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 45 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidentiary hearing is required in the first application for postconviction relief in all cases involving applicants sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Tassone v. State, 42 A.3d 1277, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 2012), limited, Ricci v. State, 196 A.3d 292, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 115 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s second R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-1 application for postconviction relief was properly denied because a hearing justice did not err in allowing defendant to proceed pro se pursuant to defendant’s own motion, defendant was provided with the requisite process that was due in the context of a parole board hearing, and defendant’s claims of actual innocence and juror misconduct were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Higham v. State, 45 A.3d 1180, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 100 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Adverse Inference.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Denial of an applicant’s post-conviction application based on ineffective assistance of counsel was proper where the hearing justice was not required to draw an adverse inference against the State due to its failure to call the applicant’s attorney to testify at the post-conviction hearing since the attorney was equally accessible to both parties, and the applicant bore the burden of proof. Jolly v. Wall, 59 A.3d 133, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 25 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Bail.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In enacting the post-conviction remedy the legislature sought to provide a scheme for collateral attack of final conviction. The legislation will not fail in its essential purpose if the supreme court does not infer a bail or recognizance provision from the chapter. State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1840 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Bail pending appeal of an unsuccessful collateral attack on a final conviction should be granted only in exceptional cases. State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1840 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court requires an applicant who requests bail to show that incarceration pending review of his application for post-conviction relief would be manifestly unjust. State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1840 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An applicant who seeks release pending appellate review of an application for post-conviction relief should move the supreme court to admit him to bail. State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1840 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For purposes of granting bail, the supreme court shall treat an appeal from a denial of an application for post-conviction relief as equivalent to a denial of a writ of habeas corpus following a final conviction. Thus, the court’s inherent power to grant bail pending review of a habeas challenge to a final conviction is incorporated in a review of the merits of an application for post-conviction relief. State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1840 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Competency of Counsel.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The correct procedure for raising a Sixth Amendment challenge to the competency of counsel is through the provisions of the Post Conviction Remedy Act rather than by appeal. State v. Freitas, 121 R.I. 412, 399 A.2d 1217, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1793 (1979); State v. Gibbons, 418 A.2d 830, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1732 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supreme Court will not review claims of lack of effective assistance of counsel on appeal unless they are founded upon specific trial court rulings, however, such issue may be raised in a more appropriate form of a post-conviction proceeding. State v. Roderick, 121 R.I. 896, 403 A.2d 1090, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2037 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the trial justice correctly found that defendant had failed to prove ineffective assistance of counsel and either judicial or prosecutorial misconduct, the defendant’s application for postconviction relief was properly denied. Dordain v. Vose, 655 A.2d 1100, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 61 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Supreme Court will not consider ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on direct appeal. Such issues are considered only in an application for postconviction relief. State v. Heath, 665 A.2d 1336, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 241 (R.I. 1995); State v. Malstrom, 672 A.2d 448, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 62 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rhode Island Supreme Court will not consider a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel that is raised for the first time on a direct appeal; such matters must be pursued in an application for post-conviction relief pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-1. State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 143 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly dismissed a prisoner’s petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-1(a)(1) challenging his child molestation convictions; the prisoner did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by R.I. Const. art. I, § 10, as evidence of the victim’s contradictory statements was entered into evidence without calling two witnesses. Young v. State, 877 A.2d 625, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 135 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because counsel’s decision not to subpoena certain medical records was a tactical decision made after what appeared to have been thoughtful consideration, the trial court properly denied defendant’s application for postconviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Lyons v. State, 880 A.2d 839, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 174 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Applicant in a postconviction relief proceeding under R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-1 did not show that trial counsel was ineffective, pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. VI and R.I. Const. art. I, § 10, for: (1) failing to request a self-defense or accident jury instruction; (2) failing to conduct a proper pretrial investigation; or (3) substantially interfering with the applicant’s right to testify when counsel informed the applicant that she would not participate in the applicant committing perjury. Larngar v. Wall, 918 A.2d 850, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 37 (R.I. 2007), overruled, Reyes v. State, 141 A.3d 644, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because defendant pointed to no authority for the proposition that counsel’s failure to file a timely R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 motion to reduce defendant’s sentence amounted to constitutionally deficient representation, and because there was an obvious tactical reason for the omission, the trial court properly denied defendant’s R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-1 motion. Burke v. State, 925 A.2d 890, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 70 (R.I. 2007), overruled, Reyes v. State, 141 A.3d 644, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Application for postconviction relief, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-1, was properly denied because the applicant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was without merit where: (1) there was an eminently rational basis for concluding that the applicant understood the consequences of pleading guilty and that he did not do so under force or coercion because the applicant stated, under oath, that he had discussed the agreement with his attorney prior to entering his plea and that he had no difficultly understanding the implications of his guilty plea; (2) the applicant’s attorney conducted an extensive investigation of the case and interviewed several relevant witnesses; (3) the attorney met with the applicant approximately fifteen times in person, and the two conferred numerous times by telephone and by exchange of written correspondence; and (4) in view of the evidence that the State had presented and in view of the real possibility that his client might receive the harshest possible penalty permitted under Rhode Island law, the attorney’s advice to his client that he plead to a negotiated sentence was well within the acceptable range of competence. Gonder v. State, 935 A.2d 82, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 110 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not entitled to relief on claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial on drug charges. Although defendant claimed that he should have called as a witness a man who executed an affidavit purportedly exculpating defendant, or at least presented the testimony of that man from a prior hearing, the man’s lack of credibility and prior criminal history meant that the decision not to do so was a sound tactical decision. Rodriguez v. State, 941 A.2d 158, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 9 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because defendant had not provided a single argument on the issues to support the prejudice prong of <i>Strickland v. Washington, </i>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), and no such prejudice was obvious from the record, the denial of the application for postconviction relief is affirmed under R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-1(a)(1). Chalk v. State, 949 A.2d 395, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 76 (R.I. 2008), overruled, Reyes v. State, 141 A.3d 644, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When analyzing counsel’s performance under the two-pronged test enunciated in <i>Strickland v. Washington, </i>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), defendant did not meet his burden of proving that counsel’s performance was deficient. Therefore, in a R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-1(a)(1) motion for postconviction relief, there was no need to address whether counsel’s representation was deficient in the context of U.S. Const. amend. VI and R.I. Const. art. 1, § 10. Brown v. State, 964 A.2d 516, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 16 (R.I. 2009), overruled, Reyes v. State, 141 A.3d 644, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Postconviction applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to support the hearing justice’s finding that the applicant’s counsel was ineffective in his representation of the applicant to the extent required to meet the threshold established in <i>Strickland. </i>Even if counsel’s performance was seriously lacking, his shortcomings, whether reviewed individually or collectively, did not prejudice the defense. Brown v. State, 964 A.2d 516, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 16 (R.I. 2009), overruled, Reyes v. State, 141 A.3d 644, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied defendant’s post-conviction petition as defendant had failed to overcome the strong presumption that his counsel’s performance was reasonably professional, in that counsel testified that he first learned of the traffic stop, which would provide an alibi for defendant in his murder case, just before trial, two years into his representation of defendant, and that, because no detail surrounding the stop were provided and because defendant had waited so long to provide him with this information, counsel refrained from pursuing an investigation and from seeking a continuance. The ever-shifting nature of defendant’s story served to confirm the hearing justice’s conclusion that the information about the traffic stop was withheld and disclosed only when defendant thought he could safely do so and discredited the testimony of defendant and his wife that they discussed the stop with the attorney in the early stages of his representation. Hazard v. State, 968 A.2d 886, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 39 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In petitioner inmate’s postconviction relief application pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-1(a)(1), where trial counsel’s testimony was deemed more credible than that of the inmate, the claim that counsel failed to investigate, file pretrial motions, or prepare for trial lacked merit; the evidence supported counsel’s claim that he was not provided with the names of any witnesses to investigate, such that there was no ineffectiveness of counsel shown in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI. Neufville v. State, 13 A.3d 607, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 13 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Petitioner inmate’s claim of ineffectiveness of counsel lacked merit in his postconviction relief petition pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-1 where he failed to show that if counsel had cross-examined a resident physician who had examined the victim of the inmate’s sexual offenses, the outcome of the trial would have been different; the victim’s testimony was deemed credible and sufficient to support the inmate’s conviction. Lynch v. State, 13 A.3d 603, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 12 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inmate was not entiteld to postconviction relief based on the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, because the testimony of trial counsel at evidentiary hearing indicated that his decisions were indeed tactical and not unreasonable in light of the circumstances; among other things, counsel had a sound basis for the decision not to use a physician’s opinion, namely that the physician essentially agreed with the State’s witness and trial counsel’s use of a nurse practitioner and the Department of Children, Youth, and Families worker as defense witnesses to shed light on prior inconsistent out-of-court statements by the victim did not rise the level of ineffective assistance, notwithstanding the resulting corroborative testimony from both witnesses achieved by the State of cross-examination. Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 22 (R.I. 2012).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As petitioner inmate’s claim of insufficiency of the evidence was addressed on direct appeal, it was barred from further review in the inmate’s postconviction relief petition by res judicata pursuant to R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s second R.I. Gen.

Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-8—as they could have been, but were not, raised in defendant’s first application for postconviction relief—and defendant had no constitutional or inherent right to parole and received due process at a parole board hearing.

<p class="p7"><b>Voluntariness of Guilty Plea.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The focus of a post-conviction inquiry when there has been a guilty plea is the nature of counsel’s advice concerning the plea and the voluntariness of the plea. State v. Dufresne, 436 A.2d 720, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1383 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The version of R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-12-22 as amended in 2000, which allowed for vacation of guilty pleas entered in the absence of an advisement regarding possible immigration repercussions, did not apply retroactively to defendant, who pled nolo contendere a few days before the statute took effect; since defendant believed defendant’s mother’s naturalization had made defendant a citizen, the trial justice was under no duty to inquire further, and defendant was not entitled to post-conviction relief from the plea. Tavarez v. State, 826 A.2d 941, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 59 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although it is clear that applicant was distraught at the beginning of the probation violation hearing, there was no evidence, other than his own assertions, that he was emotional to an extent that rendered his understanding of his admission to the violation a nullity. The record clearly demonstrated that applicant’s rights concerning the hearing and the effect of his waiver were adequately explained to him and his admission was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily; therefore, applicant was not entitled to postconviction relief.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inmate’s postconviction petition under R.I. Gen.

Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 11 purposes, even though DOC’s method of calculating such credits was changed after the state’s highest court found that the up-front method of calculating the credits violated R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-24(a), as: (1) DOC had the discretion to decide whether to award good-time and industrial-time credits at all; and (2) the trial court had no authority over DOC’s determination with respect to individual inmates. Cote v. State, 994 A.2d 59, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 56 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inmate’s postconviction petition under R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-1(a)(1) was properly denied as the inmate did not show that the inmate’s nolo contendere plea was involuntary for R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 11 purposes, even though the Rhode Island Department of Corrections’ (DOC) method of calculating such credits was changed after the state’s highest court found that the up-front method of calculating the credits violated R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-24(a), as: (1) the inmate only presented the inmate’s unsubstantiated assertions that the inmate was informed by the DOC that the inmate might serve a lesser time based upon a table circulated to inmates illustrating credits that could be received for good-behavior and work-time; (2) there was no evidence of discussions before the trial court at the plea hearing as to the inmate’s understanding of the voluntariness of the inmate’s plea; and (3) the inmate provided no documentation of good-behavior and work-time credits actually earned during the inmate’s incarceration.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Denial of an inmate’s postconviction relief petition was proper because the inmate’s Alford plea was voluntary, intelligent, and knowing for R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 11 purposes and the inmate was well aware of the nature of the charges against him at the time he pled to them; it was acceptable for the trial justice to rely on the prosecutor’s recitation of the State’s evidence to establish the factual basis. The inmate failed to satisfy his burden of proving that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered. Camacho v. State, 58 A.3d 182, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 10 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Denial of an applicant’s post-conviction application was proper where the applicant’s nolo contendere plea to second-degree child molestation was voluntary as: (1) the applicant informed the hearing justice during the plea colloquy that he had earned a GED and denied that he was under the influence of any substance; (2) the applicant confirmed that he had reviewed the plea agreement with his attorney and averred that he understood it; and (3) the record reflected no uncertainty, apprehension, or wavering by the applicant during the plea hearing. Jolly v. Wall, 59 A.3d 133, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 25 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not entitled to postconviction relief on the basis that his plea of nolo contendere was not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given because he lacked the assistance of an interpreter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Defendant had resided and worked in the United States for years, and there was no evidence that he lacked a basic, functional understanding of English; during the hearing, he answered all questions posed and was not confused or unable to understand the colloquy.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that the superior court modified defendant’s sentence one week after his nolo contendere plea due to the State’s error, reducing one count to a misdemeanor and the punishment for that count from five years to one year, did not require vacation of the plea or persuade the appellate court that the plea was not knowing and voluntary. Abdoulie Njie v. State, 156 A.3d 429, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 40 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Postconviction hearing justice properly found that the trial court fully satisfied the requirements of R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 11 when defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to possession of cocaine. Denial of the applicant’s postconviction petition also could have been based on the doctrine of laches, as over 12 years had passed since defendant’s plea and defendant did not offer a credible explanation for the delay. Desamours v. State, 210 A.3d 1177, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 97 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Waiver.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A strategic decision to avoid an issue at trial operates as a waiver in all subsequent proceedings. State v. Duggan, 414 A.2d 788, 1980 R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A defendant will not be deprived of judicial review of an alleged deprivation of a basic constitutional right when the failure to comply with the procedural requirement is not a deliberate bypass, if it does not constitute sandbagging by a defense lawyer, and if the record discloses that the breach complained of will constitute something more than harmless error. Mastracchio v. Houle, 416 A.2d 116, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1654 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where issues forming basis of defendant’s post-conviction relief application had not been raised on direct appeal, and where defendant did not claim he had been denied effective assistance of counsel, such issues were deemed waived.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inmate sought postconviction relief, alleging that he did not receive a fair trial due to vouching by a prosecution witness, and that the testimony’s prejudicial effect was not cured by a cautionary instruction. This issue was waived, as the trial court provided him with the option of a mistrial or a cautionary instruction, he elected the latter, and did not challenge the instruction at trial or on direct appeal. Hall v. State, 60 A.3d 928, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 33 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Withdrawal of Appointed Counsel.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In granting appointed counsel’s motion to withdraw, the postconviction relief (PCR) followed the procedures of Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130, 135-37 (R.I. 2000), because 1) counsel filed a “no-merit” memorandum explaining why he believed each of plaintiff’s claims lacked merit; 2) after holding a hearing on a hearing on the motion to withdraw, the PCR court found that all of plaintiff’s claims were waived, previously litigated, or meritless; and 3) it afforded him the opportunity to pursue his application pro se. Perez v. State, 57 A.3d 677, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 3 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Withdrawal of Pleas.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where motion to withdraw a plea of guilty nolo contendere was untimely because imposition of the sentence preceded the filing of that motion, the appeal was treated as if it were from denial of an application for post-conviction relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act, §§ 10-9.1-1 to 10-9.1-9, as amended, under which authority defendant could validly pursue her claim. State v. Williams, 122 R.I. 32, 404 A.2d 814, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2077 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the guilty plea was validly entered, the court hearing a petition for post-conviction relief to withdraw the plea does not consider any alleged prior constitutional infirmity.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Within twenty (20) days after receiving notice of the docketing of the application, or within any further time the court may fix, the attorney general shall respond by answer or by motion which may be supported by affidavits. At any time prior to entry of judgment the court may grant leave to withdraw the application. The court may make appropriate orders for amendment of the application or any pleading or motion, for pleading over, for filing further pleadings or motions, or for extending the time of the filing of any pleading. In considering the application the court shall take account of substance regardless of defects of form.

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> When a court is satisfied, on the basis of the application, the answer or motion, and the record, that the applicant is not entitled to post conviction relief and no purpose would be served by any further proceedings, it may indicate to the parties its intention to dismiss the application and its reasons for so doing. The applicant shall be given an opportunity to reply to the proposed dismissal. In light of the reply, or on default thereof, the court may order the application dismissed or grant leave to file an amended application or direct that the proceedings otherwise continue. Disposition on the pleadings and record is not proper if there exists a genuine issue of material fact.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Counsel’s Motion to Withdraw.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rather than rely on appointed-counsel’s conclusion concerning the merits of the defendant’s application for post-conviction relief, the court should have assessed counsel’s proposed withdrawal from representation in light of whatever grounds the defendant may have proposed for seeking post-conviction relief, and then determined on the record whether to permit counsel to withdraw. Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 153 (R.I. 2000), overruled, Motyka v. State, 172 A.3d 1203, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 121 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Res Judicata.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>On appeal from the denial of postconviction relief, decision on the defendant’s direct appeal, in which no violation of his constitutional rights with respect to the use of a benzidine test were found, was res judicata of the substantially identical issue raised in the application for postconviction relief. Carillo v. Moran, 463 A.2d 178, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1027 (R.I. 1983).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In order to have a meaningful opportunity to reply prior to summary dismissal under R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Postconviction relief court erred in summarily dismissing a first-time applicant’s claims on res judicata grounds because he did not have a meaningful opportunity to reply to the State’s motion to dismiss, as required by R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-6(b), since he lacked the assistance of appointed counsel guaranteed by R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-5. Campbell v. State, 56 A.3d 448, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 155 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Standards.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The standard for dismissing an application under subdivision (c) is the same as that used in ruling on motions under R.C.P. 12(b)(6). Palmigiano v. State, 120 R.I. 402, 387 A.2d 1382, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 677 (1978).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Summary Denial.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Summary denial of application for post-conviction relief was proper where petitioner asserted denial of his constitutional right to a fair trial as a result of jurors having read newspaper accounts of his trial, but the articles contained no testimony which was unavailable to the jury nor any prejudicial comments. Palmigiano v. State, 120 R.I. 402, 387 A.2d 1382, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 677 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the trial justice improperly denied the petitioner an opportunity to reply to the court’s stated intent to dismiss his application for post-conviction relief, the judgment dismissing the application was vacated and the case remanded.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Hearing justice erred in dismissing defendant’s application for post-conviction relief without first providing defendant with an opportunity to reply to the proposed dismissal of his application without an evidentiary hearing. State v. Frazar, 776 A.2d 1062, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 185 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Applicant’s request for postconviction relief was improperly denied as the applicant was not given an opportunity to respond to the proposed dismissal of his application for lack of activity under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-8-5; the requirement of R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-6(b) of an opportunity to respond to a proposed dismissal could not be disregarded. Corners v. State, 922 A.2d 176, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 48 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Summary dismissal of defendant’s application for postconviction relief by the trial justice was appropriate, as provided for in R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-6(b), because the question before the justice was a question of law, and defendant was afforded an opportunity to respond, and did respond, to the motion to dismiss by the State of Rhode Island. Further, the justice considered defendant’s argument, but perceived no constitutional infirmity to the sentencing statute under which defendant was imprisoned. Sosa v. State, 949 A.2d 1014, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 77 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inmate was not improperly denied the opportunity to present testimonial or documentary evidence in support of the inmate’s second postconviction-relief application because (1) the inmate declined a chance to present testimonial or documentary evidence, and (2) the inmate filed extensive memoranda and documents related to the application, so the inmate had a sufficient chance to respond to the application’s proposed dismissal, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-6(b). Brown v. State, 32 A.3d 901, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 142 (R.I. 2011).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>On an application for postconviction relief, the absence of a trial transcript, coupled with the lack of an evidentiary hearing, precluded an adequate, independent review of trial counsel’s effectiveness.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In dismissing an inmate’s petition for postconviction relief, the court complied with R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-6(b) by affording him an opportunity to reply to its proposed summary dismissal and giving him ample additional time to file another memorandum in support of his petition, which he failed to do. Perez v. State, 57 A.3d 677, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 3 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No genuine issue of material fact barred the summary dismissal of a postconviction applicant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because the only material the applicant produced in opposition was inadmissible.

<p class="p7"><b>Summary Judgment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the trial justice relied on matters outside the pleadings in denying an application for post-conviction relief, the state’s motion under subdivision (b) was treated as a motion for summary judgment as if brought under subdivision (c).

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in denying an applicant’s petition for postconviction relief on the ground that it was barred by the doctrine of laches because the State proved that the applicant’s delay was unreasonable; the applicant waited fourteen years to file his petition, and during that time, he had repeated contact with the judicial system in the form of fulfilling his obligations to register as a sex offender, and appearing before the court in relation to his probation requirements.

<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the state trial court misallocated the burden of proof in a post-conviction proceeding but that allocation did not dictate the court’s finding of probable cause and voluntary consent, the misallocation did not deny the applicant a full and fair opportunity to litigate his fourth amendment claims, and thus federal habeas corpus relief was barred. Palmigiano v. Houle, 618 F.2d 877, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 18824 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 901, 101 S. Ct. 272, 66 L. Ed. 2d 132, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 3508 (1980).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In proceedings under this chapter the petitioner generally bears the burden of proving his allegations by a preponderance of the evidence. Palmigiano v. Mullen, 119 R.I. 363, 377 A.2d 242, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1909 (1977).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Petitioner’s claim that the postconviction justice failed to follow procedure set forth in <i>Shatney v. State, </i>755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000), before permitting his counsel to withdraw lacked merit; the petitioner was permitted to submit to the court two <i>pro se </i>memoranda to supplement the application for postconviction relief and the petitioner was given an opportunity to speak on his own behalf at all three hearings. Thornton v. State, 948 A.2d 312, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 71 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Findings of Fact.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-7 required a court to make specific findings of fact and state expressly its conclusions of law relating to each issue presented, the hearing justice could not have ruled that the applicant’s constitutional rights were violated without first determining that his counsel’s performance was deficient and that that deficiency did in fact prejudice the applicant’s defense. Brown v. State, 964 A.2d 516, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 16 (R.I. 2009), overruled, Reyes v. State, 141 A.3d 644, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Post Conviction Relief Denied.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because defendant’s lawyer undertook a lengthy and pointed cross-examination of the complaining witness and the admission of a witness’s hearsay evidence was not prejudicial, defendant failed to establish prejudice resulting from the lawyer’s performance; consequently, the trial court properly denied defendant’s petition for postconviction relief. Anderson v. State, 878 A.2d 1049, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 145 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inmate was not entitled to postconviction relief based on a claim that the inmate’s trial preparations secretly were taped by hidden camera while he was incarcerated and provided to the state’s attorneys, who allegedly used the tapes to subvert his defense during trial and thus, he was entitled to depose various police officers and guards to prove his allegations, because the inmate was not entitled to take depositions of any other individual and therefore could not survive the state’s motion for summary disposition.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court properly denied defendant’s application for postconviction relief. While approximately 10 years had passed since the attorneys represented defendant and they had represented numerous defendants since his respective cases, each attorney testified that his standard practice was to consider any suppression issues whenever he represented a criminal defendant, that he did not have an independent recollection of defendant’s case, but that a review of the criminal information package for the pertinent case had jogged some details in his memory; defendant did not provide a specific basis for his allegations or any evidence to support them; and while hindsight clearly revealed the far-reaching collateral consequences of his nolo contendere pleas, defendant received three favorable dispositions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lipscomb v.

Regardless, premature appeals were timely filed, and an order that granted an application for postconviction relief was considered a final judgment for purposes of appeal to the Supreme Court of Rhode Island pursuant to R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As petitioner inmate’s claim of insufficiency of the evidence was addressed on direct appeal, it was barred from further review in the inmate’s postconviction relief petition by res judicata pursuant to R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s second R.I. Gen.

Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-8—as they could have been, but were not, raised in defendant’s first application for postconviction relief—and defendant had no constitutional or inherent right to parole and received due process at a parole board hearing.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inmate’s claim, in a second application for postconviction relief, that the inmate was entitled to relief due to the prosecution’s failure to disclose the victim’s medical records was procedurally barred because (1) the inmate did not raise the claim in the prior postconviction relief application, in which the inmate argued defense counsel provided ineffective assistance for not obtaining the records, (2) this ground for relief was “available” to the inmate when the inmate filed the inmate’s first application, since the inmate clearly had notice, at that time, of the existence of the records, and (3) the “interests of justice” exception in R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-8 did not apply, since the inmate offered no reason why the inmate’s challenge could not have been raised in the inmate’s prior application, especially given the inmate’s prior notice of the records’ existence.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Applicant’s claim that his conviction and sentence as an aider and abetter violated R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-1-3 was not waived under R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Postconviction relief court erred in summarily dismissing a first-time applicant’s claims on res judicata grounds because he did not have a meaningful opportunity to reply to the State’s motion to dismiss, as required by R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inmate’s application for postconviction relief was properly denied, as his claim concerning the purported inadequacy of a cautionary instruction was barred by res judicata under R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Res judicata barred defendant’s postconviction claims of untimely habitual offender sentencing notice and lack of defendant’s consent to an indictment amendment because (1) the parties were the same as on direct appeal resulting in a final judgment, when defendant could have raised the claims, and (2) an interest of justice exception did not apply. Ricci v. State, 196 A.3d 292, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 115 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court properly denied defendant’s application for postconviction relief because, inter alia, defendant’s contentions that the trial justice impermissibly amended the indictment by instructing the jury on aiding and abetting when he was charged as principal, and erred by sentencing him to life without parole for first-degree murder followed by a consecutive life sentence under § 11-47-3.2—were barred by the doctrine of res judicata in § 10-9.1-8; further, defendant was indeed convicted as a principal, defendant did not file a motion to reduce his sentence under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35, and § 11-47-3.2 mandated that his sentence under that statute was to run consecutively to any other sentence imposed. Graham v. State, 229 A.3d 63, 2020 R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Bail pending appeal of an unsuccessful collateral attack on a final conviction should be granted only in exceptional cases. State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1840 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court requires an applicant who requests bail to show that incarceration pending review of his application for post-conviction relief would be manifestly unjust. State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1840 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An applicant who seeks release pending appellate review of an application for post-conviction relief should move the supreme court to admit him to bail. State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1840 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For purposes of granting bail, the supreme court shall treat an appeal from a denial of an application for post-conviction relief as equivalent to a denial of a writ of habeas corpus following a final conviction. Thus, the court’s inherent power to grant bail pending review of a habeas challenge to a final conviction is incorporated in a review of the merits of an application for post-conviction relief.

<p class="p7"><b>Petition.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not entitled to postconviction relief on a murder charge because the murder charge and defendant’s eventual guilty plea were not before the court in the application for relief; the gravamen of defendant’s application was, by its own terms, the breaking and entering and larceny pleas that were entered against defendant. Moreover, when defendant pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, defendant agreed to dismiss all pending actions, including the application for postconviction relief. Burke v.

<p class="p7"><b>Record on Appeal.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the record was devoid of any judgment or order embodying a magistrate’s decision, pursuant to R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the respondent has produced a certificate of appointment to the office from the proper authority, the burden is then on the petitioner to establish by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the respondent is not legally entitled to the office and should be ousted and petitioner’s right to office recognized. McGroarty v. Ferretti, 56 R.I. 152, 184 A. 508, 1936 R.I. LEXIS 92 (1936).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the regularity of the meeting at which the election was made was in dispute, respondent could show by parol evidence or otherwise the manner and by whom the meeting was called. Gelinas v. Fugere, 55 R.I. 225, 180 A. 346, 1935 R.I. LEXIS 25 (1935).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>On petition in the nature of quo warranto supreme court could review the evidence to determine whether statutory grounds had existed for the removal of petitioners from office. Jackvony v. Berard, 66 R.I. 290, 18 A.2d 889, 1941 R.I. LEXIS 29 (1941).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Parties.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A person holding over until his successor was appointed had a sufficient interest to allow him to bring proceedings in his own name to determine right and title to the office. McGroarty v. Ferretti, 56 R.I. 152, 184 A. 508, 1936 R.I. LEXIS 92 (1936).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In proceeding under this chapter where only the public interest is involved the intervention of the attorney-general is necessary. Black v. Cummings, 62 R.I. 361, 5 A.2d 858, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 34 (1939).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A petition in equity in the nature of quo warranto can be filed without the intervention of the attorney-general only if the petitioner alleges that he is entitled to the office and that the respondent is not entitled to it.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any proceeding upon a writ of quo warranto or by way of information in the nature of quo warranto which seeks to enforce a public right cannot be brought unless it is instituted by the attorney general or the attorney general intervenes in the proceeding and the relief it affords is limited to the ouster of the incumbent from office while for a petition in equity in the nature of quo warranto there is no necessity for intervention by the attorney general since the proceeding may be instituted by one who claims title to an office and the successful petitioner may obtain a decree which not only ousts the respondent from office but also declares that petitioner is the rightful holder of the office in dispute. Fargnoli v. Cianci, 121 R.I. 153, 397 A.2d 68, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1758 (1979).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Pleadings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In information in the nature of quo warranto it was necessary to aver only that the respondent was in possession of the office without lawful authority and it was for the respondent to aver the facts upon which his title to office depended. State v. Carroll, 17 R.I. 591, 24 A. 106, 24 A. 835, 1892 R.I. LEXIS 47 (1892).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a petitioner seeks permission to file a petition in equity under the statute without intervention of the attorney-general, the primary issue must be the right of the petitioner to the office, and the petitioner must allege claim to it and facts in support of such claim. Black v. Cummings, 62 R.I. 361, 5 A.2d 858, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 34 (1939).</p>

The receiver shall submit a report and his or her recommendations to the court and the court may terminate the plan.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> If the addition of any prior creditor included in the plan by reason of the provision in § 10-18-8(a)(2) or of any subsequent creditor by reason of § 10-18-11(a) and (b) shall make continuation of the plan unfeasible, the court may, upon petition of the debtor, the receiver, or any creditor, with notice to all other parties, and upon a hearing, terminate these proceedings.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> If the debtor makes preferential payments to creditors participating in the plan during the pendency of the proceedings or appears for any reason to be abusing the privileges of this chapter, the receiver shall promptly report the matter to the court and the court may terminate the plan.

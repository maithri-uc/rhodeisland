<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since this section makes every act which is an offense at common law punishable in Rhode Island, the legislature intended to preserve and not impair or abrogate the common law. State v. LaPlume, 118 R.I. 670, 375 A.2d 938, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1507 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The inherent power of the courts to punish for contempt of their authority is not controlled by this section. This section addresses offenses at common law for which the General Laws do not prescribe punishment. This statute assured that a person who had committed an offense at common law could not evade prosecution and punishment because the offense had not been declared a crime in the laws of the state. State v. Price, 672 A.2d 893, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 94 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Champerty.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Champerty is a common law offense. Martin v. Clarke, 8 R.I. 389, 1866 R.I. LEXIS 26 (1866).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Conspiracy.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As conspiracy was and still is an offense at common law, a defendant may be prosecuted for conspiracy under this section by an indictment which alleged conspiracy and also referred to specific acts perpetrated in the course of the conspiracy which were separate substantive criminal offenses and were not mutually exclusive crimes and still satisfied the constitutional burden of reasonably apprising the defendant of the charges against him. State v. Giorgi, 115 R.I. 1, 339 A.2d 268, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1110 (1975). But see State v. LaPlume, 118 R.I. 670, 375 A.2d 938, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1507 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although conspiracy to commit an unlawful act outside the state is now covered by § 11-1-7, it was an indictable offense under this section. State v. LaPlume, 118 R.I. 670, 375 A.2d 938, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1507 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since § 11-1-6 now prescribes a specific punishment for the common law crime of conspiracy, the applicability of this section to conspiracy prosecutions has been impliedly repealed. State v. Macarelli, 118 R.I. 693, 375 A.2d 944, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1509 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One defendant in a prosecution for conspiracy cannot be convicted when all of his alleged coconspirators, be they one or more, have been acquitted or been discharged under circumstances which amount to an acquittal. State v. Donato, 414 A.2d 797, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1642 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No action in furtherance of the conspiracy beyond the making of the unlawful agreement need occur for the crime to be committed. State v. Sabitoni, 434 A.2d 1339, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1265 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The crime of conspiracy is the combination of two or more persons to commit an unlawful act or to do a lawful act for an unlawful purpose. State v. Sabitoni, 434 A.2d 1339, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1265 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rhode Island follows the common-law rule of conspiracy, which punishes the combination of two or more persons to commit an unlawful act or a lawful act for an unlawful purpose. State v. Brown, 486 A.2d 595, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 419 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A conspiracy continues as long as its purposes have neither been abandoned nor accomplished. State v. Brown, 486 A.2d 595, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 419 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>False Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The willful misleading of a court by the production of false evidence may be prosecuted as a common law offense. State v. Horton, 47 R.I. 341, 133 A. 236 (1926).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Misprision of Felony.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Misprision of felony is an indictable offense. State v. Flynn, 100 R.I. 520, 217 A.2d 432, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 471 (1966).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Monopoly.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Conspiracy to create a monopoly was a common law offense. State v. Eastern Coal Co., 29 R.I. 254, 70 A. 1, 1908 R.I. LEXIS 53 (1908).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Suicide.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>At common law, suicide was a serious felony, and Rhode Island recognizes all common-law offenses that have not been specifically abrogated or superseded by statute. In re Marlene B., 540 A.2d 1028, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 57 (R.I. 1988).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ultimately, what combination of evidence and inferences will be legally sufficient to support a verdict of guilty as an aider and abettor must be determined on a case-by-case basis. State v. Gazerro, 420 A.2d 816, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1820 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Beyond mere presence, the circumstances must establish that a defendant shared in the criminal intent of the principal and there must be a community of unlawful purpose at the time the act is committed. State v. Gazerro, 420 A.2d 816, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1820 (R.I. 1980); State v. Manning, 447 A.2d 393, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 958 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Factors not alone dispositive, but which will be considered in their totality to determine a defendant’s guilty participation as an aider and abettor include association or relationship between the perpetrator and those accused of aiding and abetting, knowledge that a crime has been committed and flight from the scene of the crime. State v. Gazerro, 420 A.2d 816, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1820 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One who aids and abets in the commission of the crime and is also present at the scene may be charged and convicted as a principal. State v. McMaugh, 512 A.2d 824, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 506 (R.I. 1986).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Aider and abettor may be convicted of a more serious offense or suffer a greater penalty than the principal, because under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-1-3, all who participated in a crime are severally responsible as principals, as though each had committed the offense alone. Jaiman v. State, 55 A.3d 224, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 137 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not prejudiced by what he challenged as an additional offense rather than defending against his potential liability as an aider and abettor because one who aided and abetted the commission of a crime and was present at the scene could be charged and convicted as a principal. State v. Parrillo, 228 A.3d 613, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 39 (R.I. 2020).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>“Aiding and Abetting.”</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The term “aiding and abetting” assumes some participation in the criminal act in furtherance of the common design, either before or at the time the criminal act is committed. State v. Gazerro, 420 A.2d 816, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1820 (R.I. 1980); State v. Manning, 447 A.2d 393, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 958 (R.I. 1982); State v. Eddy, 519 A.2d 1137, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 389 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The term “aiding and abetting” implies some conduct of an affirmative nature and mere negative acquiescence is not sufficient. State v. Gazerro, 420 A.2d 816, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1820 (R.I. 1980); State v. Manning, 447 A.2d 393, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 958 (R.I. 1982); State v. Eddy, 519 A.2d 1137, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 389 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is unnecessary that every act of the person who aids and abets should coincide with the act of the principal perpetrator. State v. Medeiros, 535 A.2d 766, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 578 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction on one count of aiding and abetting the crime of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-1-3 where defendant, a police officer, gave a friend affirmative assistance to help the friend’s drug dealing. The evidence showed that defendant did more than merely acquiesce in the friend’s conduct, and that defendant assisted the friend by checking license plates of suspicious cars in the friend’s neighborhood and telling the friend when to “lay low” because police might have learned of the friend’s drug operation. State v. Grant, 946 A.2d 818, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 56 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff could not show that the social hosts were liable pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-2 for supplying the plaintiff and her boyfriend with alcohol for more than a three-hour period, which resulted in the boyfriend driving into a utility pole after the boyfriend and plaintiff left the residence. The plaintiff did not show that the social hosts had the intent necessary pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-1-3 to aid and abet a criminal act. Willis v. Omar, 954 A.2d 126, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 84 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a murder prosecution, the trial court’s aiding and abetting instruction accurately reflected the law with respect to intent because it explained that only if defendant knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted could he be held responsible for the natural or probable consequences of that act. Thus, his due process rights were not violated by a conclusive or burden-shifting presumption. State v. Delestre, 35 A.3d 886, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 6 (R.I.), cert. denied, 566 U.S. 1015, 132 S. Ct. 2442, 182 L. Ed. 2d 1071, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 3824 (2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal on a charge of aiding and abetting the manufacture and cultivation of marijuana because testimony by a witness, who entered into a cooperation agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, placed defendant at the rented property when the marijuana grow operations were underway, defendant’s actions demonstrated a shared unlawful intent to manufacture or cultivate marijuana and, further, a community of unlawful purpose existed between and among defendant, the witness, and a third person. State v. Long, 61 A.3d 441, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 37 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since there was sufficient evidence to convict the inmate under an aiding and abetting theory, the hearing justice erred when she held that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to propose a jury instruction or challenge the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to the aiding and abetting theory and the grant of postconviction relief was erroneous. A jury certainly could have found, and did find, that the defendant brought a gun to the scene of the crime Whitaker v. State, 199 A.3d 1021, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 15 (R.I. 2019).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Conviction and Sentence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>That an applicant’s accomplice was the shooter and was convicted of second-degree murder did not preclude the applicant’s conviction and sentence for first-degree murder, because under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-1-3, an aider and abettor could be convicted of a more serious offense and suffer a greater penalty than the principal. Jaiman v. State, 55 A.3d 224, 2012 R.I.

<p class="p7"><b>Jury Instructions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not err when instructing the jury that it could convict defendant of manufacturing or cultivating marijuana as an aider or abettor because testimony by a witness, who entered into a cooperation agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, demonstrated that defendant was involved in the growing process both before and after the process commenced, present when the witness arrived to inspect the marijuana plants, and, once the cultivation was underway, the witness discussed the operation with defendant approximately every other day; thus, the witness’s testimony that defendant was at the property on a number of occasions was sufficient to support the jury charge with respect to aiding and abetting. State v. Long, 61 A.3d 441, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 37 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where several witnesses described a chaotic scene in which defendant was one of several individuals who were simultaneously attacking the victim, thus making it difficult to determine which specific attacker delivered which specific blows to the victim’s body and face, the testimony made it clear that defendant was a participant in a community of unlawful purpose at the time the act was committed. and the trial justice did not err giving an aiding-and-abetting instruction to the jury. State v. Haffner, 242 A.3d 468, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 82 (R.I. 2020).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mere presence at the scene of a crime, in and of itself, is insufficient to warrant a conviction as an aider or abettor, but it is a factor that must form part of a court’s determination of the guilt of the defendant.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One defendant in a prosecution for conspiracy cannot be convicted when all of his alleged coconspirators, be they one or more, have been acquitted or been discharged under circumstances which amount to an acquittal. State v. Donato, 414 A.2d 797, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1642 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Elements of Offense.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Identity of Conspirators.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When an information specifically alleges that only two named persons conspired, the identity of those two individuals becomes an essential element of the offense. State v. DeSanto, 603 A.2d 744, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 55 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence — Admissibility.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where witness against defendant on trial for conspiracy to murder was not an indicted conspirator and where he testified to acts and to the declaration of defendant himself which were used solely against defendant at his own trial, witness’ testimony was admissible. State v. LaPlume, 118 R.I. 670, 375 A.2d 938, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1507 (1977).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the defendant was found not guilty of murder, evidence of the murder was properly admitted at the defendant’s conspiracy trial since the evidence was offered only to show some motive or plan in connection with the conspiracy. State v. Hewes, 666 A.2d 402, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 235 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence — Sufficiency.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery in the lower court, but the only evidence which linked defendant with the man who attempted the robbery was that he was seen to leave in a car with the robber before the crime was committed and was seen to return afterward, the inference of conspiracy was too speculative to support a conviction. State v. Distante, 118 R.I. 532, 375 A.2d 212, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1495 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for acquittal on charge of conspiracy to statutorily burn where record established that codefendant and defendant had met on various occasions at which they discussed the burning of codefendant’s warehouse, that defendant agreed to slow down the fire department’s response to the fire in order to enable the warehouse to burn, to point out the broken door hasp (which would indicate a forced entry), and to keep codefendant informed of any investigations, and that codefendant set the date of the fire after determining from defendant the nights on which he would be working as battalion commander at the fire department. State v. Parente, 460 A.2d 430, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 916 (R.I. 1983).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because there was eyewitness testimony from the homeowner who saw three men removing items from his home and placing them in a car, the trial court was clearly justified in finding the State’s witnesses to be credible and in rejecting defendant’s motion for a new trial in regard to defendant’s convictions for breaking and entering a dwelling and conspiracy. State v. Becote, 864 A.2d 598, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 7 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice properly denied defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of conspiracy because there was more than sufficient evidence for a jury to find that defendant and another man were engaged in a conspiracy to murder the victim. The evidence included: (1) defendant’s testimony that defendant and the other man drove together in the other man’s car to the motel where the victim was shot immediately before the shooting; (2) defendant’s friends and cell mate testified that defendant said that the other man hired defendant to do the job; and (3) a rough diagram of the motel where the shooting occurred was found in the other man’s car. State v. Graham, 941 A.2d 848, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 22 (R.I.), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 848, 129 S. Ct. 99, 172 L. Ed. 2d 82, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 6960 (2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because defendant participated in a coordinated attack on a defenseless man that began with an ambush of the victim’s vehicle and ended with a robbery and severe beating, based on the totality of the evidence, the jury reasonably could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant entered into an agreement with others to commit the crime of robbery. State v. Perkins, 966 A.2d 1257, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 33 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that defendant and another agreed unlawfully to enter the dwelling with the intent to rob its occupants, and that defendant and another assembled disguises, weapons, and duct tape to further that purpose, was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for conspiracy to commit burglary. State v. Abdullah, 967 A.2d 469, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 37 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s convictions of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, possession of one ounce to one kilo of a controlled substance, and conspiracy to violate Rhode Island’s Uniform Controlled Substances Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 21, ch. 28, were vacated. As the evidence was insufficient to prove he knew of and intended to exercise control over cocaine found in his passengers’ purses, the evidence did not support the inference that he agreed with them to traffic in drugs. State v. Berroa, 6 A.3d 1095, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 102 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Conspiracy convictions were supported by evidence that there was an agreement between defendants and a third person to shoplift. State v. Cipriano, 21 A.3d 408, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 101 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Juvenile was properly adjudicated delinquent for conspiracy to commit robbery because (1) the State produced sufficient evidence of the crime’s corpus delicti to permit admission of the juvenile’s confession through reports of the robbery, apprehension of the juvenile and another nearby within 30 minutes of the reports, the other’s BB gun and cash when arrested, and the juvenile’s footprints leading to another gun, gloves, and a ski mask about 20 feet from where he was arrested, and (2) the confession and other circumstantial evidence proved the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Joseph C., 178 A.3d 288, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 16 (R.I. 2018).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Multiple Offenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Verdicts of guilty of murder in the second degree and of conspiracy to murder, each a separate and distinct crime are not legally incompatible where the evidence is sufficient to support convictions on both charges. State v. Leonardo, 119 R.I. 7, 375 A.2d 1388, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1855 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>RICO Violation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For a conviction for conspiracy to violate the Rhode Island Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) statute, a defendant must agree to become a member of the enterprise and only agree that members of the enterprise violate the Rhode Island RICO statute.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>All those whose cases have not been reduced to final judgment prior to the enactment of this ameliorative section should be accorded the more lenient treatment provided herein; the savings statute, § 43-3-23, which would operate to impose the harsher sentence under the prior law, § 11-1-1, is inapplicable. State v. Macarelli, 118 R.I. 693, 375 A.2d 944, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1509 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a defendant’s motion to reduce sentence because the two and one-half year difference between his sentence for breaking and entering and his co-hort’s sentence was not disproportionate as they did not have to receive equal sentences and their were departure factors applicable to the defendant, which the trial justice justified in his findings such as the defendant being a career criminal, the crime turned into one of violence, he lacked remorse, and he had lied on the stand. Further, the trial court did not err by ordering the sentences for the breaking and entering, consipracy to commit breaking and entering, simple assault, and driving a motor vehicle without the permission of the owner to run consecutively rather than concurrently since the trial court justified its order by finding that it was not just a run-of-the-mill breaking and entering, the lives of the victims were changed forever, the defendant had no remorse for the crimes, and took no personal responsibility for his actions.

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The application of this provision to a defaulting parent did not render it an invalid ex post facto law, even when a substantial portion of arrearage occurred prior to the enactment of this provision, since no criminal liability was incurred until after the arrearage totaled $30,000 and the defendant had willfully failed to make a scheduled installment payment after the provision’s enactment. State v. Pelz, 765 A.2d 824, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 30 (R.I. 2001).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the termination of defendant’s parental rights under R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-7-7(a) did not terminate defendant’s parental obligations, namely his obligation to pay child support, the trial court erred in calculating the amount of child support defendant owed and in dismissing the information accusing defendant of violating R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-2-1.1. State v. Fritz, 801 A.2d 679, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 157 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Probable Cause.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was requisite probable cause to establish violation of the child support provision since, at the time of his arrest, the defendant owed over $30,000 exclusive of interest and after his arrearage had reached the statutory minimum, he had failed to make any payments for a period of four months despite having the financial means to do so.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting a note from defendant to his girlfriend which was probative of his consciousness of guilt of the crimes charged. State v. Gordon, 508 A.2d 1339, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 464 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not abuse his discretion in allowing testimony regarding the theft of a medical-treatment card which belonged to the owner of the building burned and was found in the car owned by defendant’s girlfriend. State v. Gordon, 508 A.2d 1339, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 464 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant is entitled to a new trial, but not a judgment of acquittal, where the trial justice, after independently assessing the evidence in light of his jury charge, determines that the state has failed to prove that the defendant knowingly caused the fire. State v. Dame, 560 A.2d 330, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 123 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial after he was convicted of first-degree arson because the trial justice concluded that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant willfully set fire to the building where his business was located; credible evidence suggested that the business was not as successful a venture as defendant described, an eyewitness saw defendant at the business on the night of the fire, and burns were found on defendant’s legs. The trial justice acted well within her discretion to reject as incredible defendant’s testimony as to how he got burned, why he was driving in the middle of a snowstorm, and how his fanny pack was stolen. State v. Gaudreau, 146 A.3d 848, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 127 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Instruction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No abuse of discretion in counsel’s declining to press issue of reading of statutory definition of crime in course of trial justice’s instruction. See Gordon v. State, 638 A.2d 56 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice properly instructed jury on elements of first-degree arson. See State v. Garcia, 643 A.2d 180, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 182 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Occupied Building.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The term “during the six (6) months preceding the offense” in this section does not require a continuous occupancy throughout the entire six-month period; rather, any point during the six-month period suffices. State v. Caprio, 477 A.2d 67, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 515 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sentence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sentence of 50 years for first-degree arson and 10 years for conspiracy to commit arson, after the trial justice had rejected the state’s recommendation of a 25-year sentence, was not an abuse of discretion, where the justice weighed relevant factors against the disastrous consequences inflicted upon the victims of the crime. State v. Gordon, 539 A.2d 528, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 43 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sentence of 30 years, 20 years to serve, after the state had recommended 30 years, 15 to serve, was within the statutory limits for the offense. State v. Marini, 638 A.2d 507, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 67 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because defendant’s 20-year sentence for first-degree arson was authorized by R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-4-2, it was not an illegal sentence; therefore, defendant’s R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 motion was properly denied. State v. Tapia, 47 A.3d 344, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 2012).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not violate R.I. Const. or U.S. Const., Amend. 14, § 1. State v. Davis, 39 R.I. 276, 97 A. 818, 1916 R.I. LEXIS 37 (1916).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not placed in double jeopardy when he was convicted for both assault with intent to rob and assault with intent to murder, because each offense requires proof of an element that the other does not. State v. Fournier, 448 A.2d 1230, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1129 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Assault With Intent to Murder.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant deliberately and willfully fed boric acid to a 22-month-old child, with the awareness of potentially grave medical consequences, this conduct exhibited an “unjustified disregard for the possibility of death or great bodily harm and an extreme indifference to the sanctity of human life,” and supported a finding of intent to murder despite defendant’s contention he was merely seeking to get the child’s mother’s attention and not kill the child. State v. Charette, 434 A.2d 280, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1260 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Specific intent to kill victim may be inferred from firing of a deadly weapon at vital part of victim’s body. State v. Fournier, 448 A.2d 1230, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1129 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Lesser-Included Offenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the state charges the defendant with two counts of assault with intent to murder in violation of this section, which requires only that the intent to murder be accompanied by some type of assault, and it is undisputed that the defendant effectuated the assault with a gun, the court acts correctly when it instructs the jury on the lesser-included offense of assault with a dangerous weapon. State v. Dordain, 566 A.2d 942, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 160 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Consolidated Trial.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, in each of three incidents, defendant drove up to women who were walking on the street and convinced them to get into his car, then either successfully forced them to perform fellatio or attempted to force them to perform fellatio, and used a firearm in two incidents, the offenses were properly consolidated pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 13 as the offenses were of the “same or similar character” under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 8(a), and defendant’s acts could be construed as part of a common scheme or plan under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 8(a) as defendant displayed the same modus operandi. State v. Hernandez, 822 A.2d 915, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 123 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Instructions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The jury instructions on a violation of this section, even if erroneous, were not prejudicial where defendant was convicted of the lesser offense of assault with a dangerous weapon. State v. Carillo, 112 R.I. 6, 307 A.2d 773, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 954 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Robbery Defined.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “robbery” when used in statutes has a technical meaning which incorporates all the elements of the common law crime. State v. Domanski, 57 R.I. 500, 190 A. 854, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 128 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Assault With Intent to Rob.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although evidence of prior criminal conduct is generally inadmissible for lack of relevance, an exception to the rule occurs where such evidence tends to establish guilty knowledge, intent, motive, design, plan, scheme, system or the like, and evidence of the theft of a starter’s pistol 20 minutes prior to an alleged assault with intent to rob where the victim testified having seen the gun barrel of a small black handgun being held by the assailant falls within the exception as tending to establish a plan, even though the events described are dissimilar. State v. Delahunt, 121 R.I. 565, 401 A.2d 1261, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1872 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Double jeopardy was found in a particular case where, in order to prove both extortion and assault with intent to rob, the state had to demonstrate the identical elements of an intentional threat to the victim that placed him in fear of actual bodily harm, the purpose of which was to force him to give the defendant money, and proof of no additional fact was required to establish both crimes. State v. Pope, 414 A.2d 781, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1640 (R.I. 1980), overruled in part, State v. Acquisto, 463 A.2d 122, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1012 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant committed assault with intent to rob when he pointed gun at victim and demanded money. State v. Fournier, 448 A.2d 1230, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1129 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An assault-with-intent-to-rob charge requires proof that the defendant unlawfully attempted to take from the person of another goods or money of any value by violence or by putting him in fear. State v. Agin, 535 A.2d 321, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 5 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sexual Assault.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature, when it amended this section in 1981, intended to substitute for the word “rape” that crime which was later defined as first-degree sexual assault, not any of the lesser degrees that describe differing, and in some instances less serious, offenses. State v. McDonald, 602 A.2d 923, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 7 (R.I. 1992).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Admissibility of Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a case resulting in defendant’s conviction for domestic assault with a dangerous weapon based on her assault of her half-sister with a knife, where defendant claimed self-defense, the trial justice did not err in excluding Facebook videos illustrating the victim’s acts of violence because the trial justice determined that the videos were cumulative to the victim’s testimony, would inflame the passion of the jurors, and would cause confusion as to what the ultimate issue in the case was. State v. Medina, 222 A.3d 1246, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 1 (R.I. 2020).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a case resulting in defendant’s conviction for domestic assault with a dangerous weapon based on her assault of her half-sister with a knife, the trial justice provided adequate grounds to support the decision to grant the State’s motion in limine to prevent defendant from mentioning that the victim had been arrested on gun charges; the charges were eventually dismissed as to the victim and use of a gun was not in issue in the current case. State v. Medina, 222 A.3d 1246, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 1 (R.I. 2020).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Apprehension of Immediate Injury.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Close proximity is not required to prove a reasonable apprehension of immediate injury. State v. Clifton, 777 A.2d 1272, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 136 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Domestic Violence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for domestic assault, when determining whether a couple has been in a “substantive dating relationship,” R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-2 directs the court to look to three factors—length, nature, and frequency—as indicative of the substance of the relationship as a whole. Section 12-29-2 does not require a specific demonstration or finding as to each of the factors, nor does it limit the court to only those three factors. State v. Enos, 21 A.3d 326, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 88 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence Sufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Record contained sufficient evidence to support the trial justice’s finding that defendant assaulted the victim with a dangerous weapon; the trial justice expressly found that a witness’s oral statement that she saw defendant threatening the victim with knives was credible. State v. Harris, 871 A.2d 341, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 53 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Conviction for felony assault under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-2 was supported by sufficient evidence, where the evidence showed that the attack on the victim resulted in eight staples to the victim’s scalp and two permanent scars, and the victim’s clothing was covered with blood after the incident, thus, allowing the jury to reasonably conclude that the victim’s wounds were serious and resulted in a permanent disfigurement to the victim’s scalp. State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 91 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was sufficient to withstand defendant’s motions for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial, where the case principally revolved around the credibility of various witnesses and the jury was entitled to believe the victim’s version of events, even though there were discrepancies in the victims’ recollection at trial and to the police. State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 22 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for domestic assault with a deadly weapon, the following evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant and the victim had been in a “substantive dating relationship” for purposes of R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-2(b): 1) the couple dated for six months; 2) they had an intimate relationship; 3) they had communication since their breakup relative to affairs of the heart; 4) they met on the night of the assault so the victim could return jewelry defendant had given her; and 5) defendant said at the scene that he had “an argument with his girlfriend.” State v. Enos, 21 A.3d 326, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 88 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s motions for a new trial and for a judgment of acquittal were properly denied as the totality of the evidence of a brutal assault, including the multiple blows to the victim’s head, the resultant bleeding and bruised raccoon eyes, her elevated vital signs, combined with the classification of the victim as critical upon her arrival at the hospital and the hospital’s response to the injuries as life-threatening, was sufficient evidence of a substantial risk of death for R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-2 purposes; indeed, the risk of death was considered substantial enough that the hospital’s medical staff contacted the victim’s family, and the readily apparent signs of the victim’s injuries were indicative of a variety of life-threatening conditions, such as a skull fracture, brain bleed, spine injury, and the risk of cardiac arrest. State v. Gaffney, 63 A.3d 888, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 62 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a witness’s testimony was bordering on farfetched and so inconsistent with testimony given by the other witnesses, the trial justice was not clearly wrong in his evaluation of the evidence; the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence was consistent with guilt because defendant held the victim to restrain her and prevent her from protecting her husband while he was being assaulted by defendant’s employees, at a location defendant selected, and made no effort to stop them. State v. Parrillo, 228 A.3d 613, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 39 (R.I. 2020).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Identification.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to suppress identification evidence, pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 12, where the police had shown the victim of defendant’s felonious assault a photographic array based on the victim’s extensive description, which was found not to be unduly suggestive, and where the victim also identified defendant in a courtroom reliably and independently. State v. Jones, 818 A.2d 649, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 48 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was sufficient evidence to warrant an objective inference that the defendant possessed the requisite criminal intent to harm since, after discharging a weapon less than two blocks away by pumping multiple bullets into his victim’s head, he immediately ran up the street, slowed down as he approached two boys, and then lifted his gun and pointed it at one of the boys’ heads. State v. Clifton, 777 A.2d 1272, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 136 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-2 is a divisible statute, and felony assault with a dangerous weapon under the statute is satisfied with a mens rea of recklessness; therefore, it does not qualify as an Armed Career Criminal Act predicate offense under 18 U.S.C. § 924 for enhanced sentencing purposes, and multiple defendants’ motions to set aside or correct their enhanced sentences, based on the statute incorrectly being considered a violent felony predicate offense, were granted. United States v. Sabetta, 221 F. Supp. 3d 210, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146476 (D.R.I. 2016), aff'd, 896 F.3d 104, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 19849 (1st Cir. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendants’ convictions for the Rhode Island offense of assault with a dangerous weapon under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-2(a) no longer qualified as predicate convictions triggering the federal Armed Career Criminals Act’s mandatory 15-year sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) because Rhode Island’s unclear (and possibly even conflicting) precedent regarding assault with a dangerous weapon’s requisite mental state prevented the court from concluding it was categorically a violent felony. United States v. Rose, 896 F.3d 104, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 19849 (1st Cir. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The jurisdiction of the offense defined in this section, where the victim is the defendant’s wife, is in the family court and, upon discovery of that fact, the superior court may transfer the trial of the indictment to the family court, notwithstanding the fact that the family court has no grand jury. State v. Perry, 103 R.I. 6, 234 A.2d 115, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 568 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The family court in a matter involving an information charge of assault with a dangerous weapon upon a mother by her adult son pursuant to this section did not have the requisite subject-matter jurisdiction to conduct a criminal trial since the defendant/son so charged was an adult. State v. Kenney, 523 A.2d 853, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 438 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once the family court had conducted a criminal trial pursuant to § 14-1-48 on a charge that an adult defendant/son assaulted his mother with a dangerous weapon, it could not retain jurisdiction over the case and proceed to sentence the defendant since the court had no subject-matter jurisdiction of the case. State v. Kenney, 523 A.2d 853, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 438 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jury Instructions.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the evidence that defendant sought to present upon any reopening of a non-jury criminal trial for felony assault with a dangerous weapon and malicious destruction of property could not be considered “newly discovered” and merely presented a question of credibility, the trial justice’s denial of a new trial pursuant to to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 33 was correct; defendant failed to set forth the particular grounds upon which defendant sought the relief requested in compliance with R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 47.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon, after he struck two victims in the back with a broken bottle, was supported by sufficient evidence where the court considered defendant’s motion for new trial and properly reviewed the testimony, addressed the credibility of each witness, and considered the evidence in the light of the jury’s charge and found the elements of assault with a dangerous weapon were satisfied.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Denial of motion for a new trial on charges of violating R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-2 was not an abuse of discretion.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Convicting defendant for both assault with a deadly weapon pursuant to this section and possession of a pistol during the commission of a crime of violence pursuant to § 11-47-3 is unconstitutional, as both convictions stem from the same incident as defined by State v. Boudreau, 113 R.I. 497, 322 A.2d 626 (1974), thereby violating the double jeopardy provision of the Constitution. State v. Grullon, 117 R.I. 682, 371 A.2d 265, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1739 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state, by proving the elements of the crime of kidnapping, does not automatically prove the crime of assault with a dangerous weapon used in the kidnapping; therefore, the offenses do not merge under the double-jeopardy clause.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is nothing inconsistent with finding a defendant guilty of both assault with a dangerous weapon and burglary, and acquitting him of assault with intent to commit murder, where the jury finds an entry with the intent to commit a felony and assault with a dangerous weapon.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The term “accident” in § 31-26-1 (leaving the scene of an accident) includes all collisions, intentional as well as unintentional. Therefore, a defendant can be found guilty of both the intentional act of assault and the act of leaving the scene of an accident, since each crime requires proof of a separate element distinct from the other. State v. Sabetta, 672 A.2d 451, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 64 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the State moved to vacate defendant’s conviction of assault with a dangerous weapon, defendant’s conviction of assault resulting in serious bodily injury was vacated because that conviction arose from the same course of conduct.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not entitled to acquittal on double jeopardy grounds as to convictions for discharging a firearm in commission of a crime of violence and assault with intent to murder because the legislature clearly intended multiple sentences for such convictions arising from one incident.

<p class="p7"><b>Present Ability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The jury could properly infer that the defendant had the present ability to carry out his threat since, even though the weapon was not recovered, two witnesses testified that they saw and heard the defendant shoot a gun as he leapt from a vehicle and that, moments later, the defendant pointed the weapon at one of the witnesses while he was fleeing from the murder scene.

State v. Lussier, 186 A.3d 581, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 87 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sentence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Total sentence of 45 years, with 30 years to serve and the remaining 15 years suspended, was proper for assault convictions, and denial of defendant’s R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35(a) motion to reduce his sentence was proper, because, inter alia, the penalty for felony assault under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-2(a) was imprisonment for not more than 20 years, and a 15-year sentence for each of these counts was not statutorily infirm; the trial justice articulated numerous reasons for giving defendant a stiff punishment including the viciousness of the crimes, defendant’s criminal record, his refusal to take responsibility or show remorse, his efforts to control the behavior of his child’s mother, and the fact that the commission of the crime was by ambush. Further, the trial justice’s exhaustive explanation justified the consecutive terms. State v. Snell, 11 A.3d 97, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 11 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Victim’s Medical Condition.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred in limiting defendant in defendant’s felony assault case from cross-examining a man, the accusing witness, other than as to the single question about whether the man planned to civilly sue defendant.

<p class="p7"><b>Construction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Supreme Court of Rhode Island has defined “battery” as an act that is intended to cause, and does cause, an offensive contact with, an unconsented touching of, or trauma upon the body of another, thereby generally resulting in the consummation of an assault. Aside from the obvious higher standard of proof required to establish criminal battery, the law recognizes no distinction between criminal and civil battery. Fenwick v. Oberman, 847 A.2d 852, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 85 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Admissibility of Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for domestic simple assault, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the prosecutor to impeach defendant with seven prior convictions, two of which involved assaultive behavior, because the similarity between the charged offense and the prior convictions did not preclude admission of those convictions. State v. McRae, 31 A.3d 785, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 131 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Defects in Indictment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure to allege the time of an offense in an indictment is a defect of form, rather than substance, and will not affect the conviction. Kenney v. State, 5 R.I. 385, 1858 R.I. LEXIS 53 (1858).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Denial of Motion to Pass.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for domestic simple assault, the victim’s testimony that defendant had been drinking at the time of the incident did not obligate the trial court to pass the case, as the comment was not sufficiently prejudicial as to prevent the jury from dispassionately considering the evidence, and there was no indication that it failed to obey the trial court’s instruction to disregard the victim’s statement. State v. McRae, 31 A.3d 785, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 131 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Instructions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Instruction to jury that complaint under this section did not charge a crime was reversible error. State v. Burns, 79 R.I. 134, 84 A.2d 803, 1951 R.I. LEXIS 19 (1951).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In light of the reference to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-3 in the criminal information and the trial evidence indicating that defendant put the victims in reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on both assault and battery. Ultimately, defendant was convicted of two counts of felony domestic assault, as charged in the information; he was neither convicted of nor sentenced for a criminal battery. State v. Cardona, 969 A.2d 667, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 54 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Multiple Offenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s contention that he was placed twice in jeopardy by being prosecuted for extortion pursuant to § 11-42-2 subsequent to a conviction for assault and battery pursuant to this section was without merit, since assault and battery, which is the intentional and unlawful application of the slightest force to the person of another, and extortion, which consists of a verbal threat to place a victim in peril of actual bodily harm accompanied by an intent to compel that victim to do an act against his will, require proof of different elements and hence do not satisfy the “same evidence” test applied by the court. State v. Davis, 120 R.I. 82, 384 A.2d 1061, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 764 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Nature of Offense.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An assault is an unlawful attempt or offer, with force or violence, to do a corporal hurt to another, whether from malice or wantonness. State v. Pope, 414 A.2d 781, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1640 (R.I. 1980), overruled in part, State v. Acquisto, 463 A.2d 122, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1012 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A threat to kill without accompanying force or violence does not constitute assault. State v. Pule, 453 A.2d 1095, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1116 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Alien was subject to removal under 8 U.S.C.S. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) based on a conviction for an aggravated felony as defined in 8 U.S.C.S. § 1101(a)(43)(F), since the state-court record indicated that the alien was convicted of assault under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-3(a) and, under state law, assault necessarily involved the use of physical force and was thus a crime of violence within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.S. § 16(a). Lopes v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 58, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 25161 (1st Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Preservation for Review.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly convicted defendant of simple assault because defendant’s arguments were not properly before the Supreme Court of Rhode Island where her speedy trial contention was never raised at trial and the criteria for invoking the narrow exception to that rule were entirely absent. State v. Connery, 139 A.3d 401, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 75 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Reduction of Sentence Properly Denied.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying an inmate’s motion to reduce sentence under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35, as the sentence was justified based on his multiple first- and second-degree sexual assaults of two women, and his simple assault of a third, all of whom were developmentally disabled women who were entrusted to his care, and who continued to live in fear as a result of the assaults. State v. Rivera, 64 A.3d 742, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 69 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sufficient evidence existed to convict defendant of assault where defendant punched the victim in the face, threw him to the floor, and choked him by the neck, defendant admitted to the responding police officer that he committed the assault, and defendant’s admission that he did not feel threatened by the victim undercut his suggestion that he acted in self-defense. State v. Bolduc, 822 A.2d 184, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 119 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a probation violation hearing relating to a charge that defendant committed assault or battery while he was on probation, the hearing justice did not err in deciding to credit the testimony of the State’s witnesses rather than the testimony of defendant’s witnesses, in that it was reasonable for the hearing justice to give a lesser weight to the testimony of an eyewitness, who admitted that he had poor eyesight and who denied ever seeing defendant, from his vantage point across the street, strike the complaining witness. State v. Jackson, 966 A.2d 1225, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 30 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a domestic assault prosecution, defendant’s wife recanted her statements to police that he hit and kicked her son and tried to slap the phone out of her hand to prevent her from calling police. However, her trial testimony that it looked like defendant was hitting her son, and that defendant tapped her arm and swore at her to prevent her from calling police, created a jury question of whether he committed acts that put her and her son in reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm. State v. Cardona, 969 A.2d 667, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 54 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the allegations that defendant committed a felony were sufficient to invoke the trial court’s subject-matter jurisdiction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 8-2-15, and because defendant failed to preserve defendant’s R.I. Super. Ct. R. Prac. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal, defendant was properly convicted of violating a no-contact order and simple assault. State v. Tower, 984 A.2d 40, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 137 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied defendant’s new trial motion, as the evidence was legally sufficient to support his convictions for first-degree and second-degree sexual assault, as well as simple assault, as the trial justice acted within his province in choosing to find the victims’ testimony more credible than that of defendant. State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 24 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 29 with respect to a charge of simple assault, as the State provided sufficient evidence to show that defendant acted with wrong intention or ill will when he struck a victim. State v. Lomba, 37 A.3d 615, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 17 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of simple assault or battery because the lieutenant testified that defendant jumped out of his car and on top of him, which sufficed to satisfy the element of an offensive touching upon another’s body. State v. Edwards, 147 A.3d 982, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 108 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a witness’s testimony was bordering on farfetched and so inconsistent with testimony given by the other witnesses, the trial justice was not clearly wrong in his evaluation of the evidence; the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence was consistent with guilt because defendant held the victim to restrain her and prevent her from protecting her husband while he was being assaulted by defendant’s employees, at a location defendant selected, and made no effort to stop them. State v. Parrillo, 228 A.3d 613, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 39 (R.I. 2020).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not entitled to a new trial on the assault with a dangerous weapon count, as he was the only person in the house to assault the victim, he was there when she woke up stabbed and bleeding, and there was evidence of defendant’s intent to murder the victim, including the severity of the victim’s wounds, which included a stab wound to her chest, ligature marks, a collapsed lung, and bleeding in her brain. State v. Grantley, 149 A.3d 124, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 118 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the victim did not identify defendant in an initial photo array, her identification of defendant was sufficient because a Facebook search by her of a name provided by the Attorney General’s office yielded profiles and photos that she scrolled through before seeing one with a familiar face that was defendant. Moreover, at trial, the victim emphasized that her in-court identification of defendant was based on his height, how big he was, and his eyes. State v. Johnson, 199 A.3d 1046, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 17 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Victim’s testimony as to the actions and statements of defendant and his accomplices led to a reasonable inference that the gun used in a robbery was operable; the victim testified that she was in fear—as demonstrated by her question to an accomplice about whether he thought the others involved in the robbery were going to kill her, defendant threatened to return if she called the police, and the gun was pointed at her for the duration of the incident.

Laws § 11-5-5, constitute separate crimes with different elements for each because only contempt requires an attack on the dignity of the court, and a conviction under § 11-5-5 requires proof of an unlawful striking of a uniformed officer. Therefore, even where contempt and the assault charges arise out of the same incident, each offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not. State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 143 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Definition of Terms.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The terms “knowingly” and “wilfully” in this section are defined in accordance with the nature of the offense charged. State v. Contreras, 105 R.I. 523, 253 A.2d 612, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 783 (1969).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A police officer assigned to a “paid detail” at a motel restaurant when he was not scheduled by the police department to work a regular shift, in uniform, considered “on duty” by the department and retaining the same benefits as accorded to him when he worked regular duty hours though he was paid by the motel management was a uniformed police officer engaged in the performance of his duties. State v. Botelho, 459 A.2d 947, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 911 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since bodily injury of a police officer sustained in the course of duty is an essential element of the offense charged under this section, a photograph showing the officer’s injuries was properly introduced in evidence in the absence of any showing that it was introduced solely to inflame the jury. State v. Pombo, 110 R.I. 133, 290 A.2d 855, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 889 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of felony assault of a police officer because a lieutenant testified that when he asked for a license, registration, and proof of insurance, defendant swore at him; defendant exited the vehicle, and jumped on top of the lieutenant; when the second officer walked around the car, a scuffle occurred, leading defendant to eventually bite the second officer in three different areas; and the trial justice reviewed hospital records and photographs evidencing those bite marks, which he referred to as showing unquestionable injury. State v. Edwards, 147 A.3d 982, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 108 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Instructions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An instruction as to the meaning of the terms “knowingly” and “wilfully” although not completely explaining the words in conventional language was sufficient where it adequately defined them according to the nature of the offense charged. State v. Contreras, 105 R.I. 523, 253 A.2d 612, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 783 (1969).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was not error to instruct the jury that there was no need to define the word “strike” because “it has the same meaning in the law under this statute as it does and is understood by all of us”, and that it is a word of common usage and has “no particular legal definition other than the definition we would find in the ordinary dictionary”. State v. Amado, 109 R.I. 53, 280 A.2d 324, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1023 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Instruction to jury that knowingly and wilfully meant voluntarily and intentionally was not error. State v. Lima, 113 R.I. 6, 316 A.2d 501, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1129 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Motion for Directed Verdict.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was direct conflict on the essential issue of “bodily injury” when policeman said he had bruises caused by the accused parties, but doctor testified that he did not see any external evidence of injury, such conflict was not open for resolution on the motion for a directed verdict. State v. Contreras, 105 R.I. 523, 253 A.2d 612, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 783 (1969).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Officer in Performance of Duties.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An officer is occupied in the exercise of his duty when he is carrying out official orders. State v. Cook, 440 A.2d 137, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 799 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a police officer, in compliance with the order of his superior officer, leaves the municipality of his employer, the officer still retains the protection afforded by this section. State v. Cook, 440 A.2d 137, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 799 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Self-Defense.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To constitute felonious conduct proscribed by this statute, the assault must be on a police officer who is actually engaged in the performance of his duties, however an officer is under no duty to use excessive force, therefore the suspect’s right to defend himself against excessive force of arresting officer is not abrogated. State v. Ramsdell, 109 R.I. 320, 285 A.2d 399, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1061 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If police officer used reasonable force in making an arrest, application of principle of self-defense is not warranted and the felony provisions of this statute apply. State v. Ramsdell, 109 R.I. 320, 285 A.2d 399, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1061 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Viewed in the light of § 12-7-10, it is clear that this section does not abrogate the defendant’s right to defend himself when excessive force is used against him. State v. Gelinas, 417 A.2d 1381, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1733 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One who comes to the aid of an arrestee must do so at his own peril and should be excused only when the individual would himself be justified in defending himself from the use of excessive force by the arresting officer. State v. Gelinas, 417 A.2d 1381, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1733 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When there is evidence tending to show the law-enforcement officer’s use of excessive force, the trial justice must instruct the jury that the force used against the law-enforcement officer was justified provided the defendant limited his assault to the use of reasonable force in defending himself from excessive force. State v. Gelinas, 417 A.2d 1381, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1733 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a police officer uses reasonable force, the application of the principle of self-defense is not warranted and the felony provisions of this section apply; it is only when a police officer engages in excessive force, that a citizen maintains his right of self-defense. State v. Botelho, 459 A.2d 947, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 911 (R.I. 1983).</p>

State v. Palmigiano, 110 R.I. 576, 295 A.2d 44, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 956 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant who was indicted on charge of attempted bribery under § 11-7-4, was properly tried in superior court since jurisdiction of district court was limited to those crimes punishable by fine, not exceeding $500 and by imprisonment not exceeding one year, and the penalty for bribery was imprisonment of a term not exceeding one year or a fine not exceeding $1,000. State v. Palmigiano, 110 R.I. 576, 295 A.2d 44, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 956 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Prejudice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant charged with bribery under § 11-7-4 was not prejudiced in any manner by action of the state in proceedings by way of indictment rather than by criminal complaint as the penalty for bribery was imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or a fine not exceeding $1,000 and infamous crime requiring an indictment as required by the state constitution was any crime punishable by more than a year imprisonment.

<p class="p7"><b>Elements of Offense.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is elementary that the offense of burglary does not necessarily include stealing or theft either at common law or by the statutes. C. &amp; G. Mfg. Co. v. Columbia Ins. Co., 89 R.I. 62, 150 A.2d 641, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 40 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The burglary statute incorporates the common-law definition of that crime which has been defined as “breaking and entering the dwelling house of another in the nighttime with the intent to commit a felony therein, whether the felony be actually committed or not”. State v. O'Rourke, 121 R.I. 434, 399 A.2d 1237, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1798 (1979); State v. Ranieri, 586 A.2d 1094, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 36 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant in the nighttime broke into apartment which was used as a dwelling and from inside the apartment partially broke through a wall into an adjoining drugstore, there could be no conviction for burglary since there was no intent to commit a felony “therein” since the intent was to commit the felony in the drugstore. State v. O'Rourke, 121 R.I. 434, 399 A.2d 1237, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1798 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For purposes of determining whether a burglary took place during the nighttime, the burglary is considered complete at the time the breaking and entering took place with felonious intent, and not at the later point in time when the defendant encountered the victim. State v. Lefebvre, 609 A.2d 957, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 153 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “breaking” in the definition of burglary is used in a technical rather than popular sense, so that there is a breaking if the intruder, by the use of force no matter how slight, removes an obstacle which if left untouched would prevent entrance. Accordingly, the trial justice properly denied the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal with respect to a burglary charge where the trier of fact may properly have concluded that the defendant had gained entrance to the victim’s apartment by the opening or removal of the screen to a bedroom window, which, if left as found, would have prevented the entering. State v. Simpson, 611 A.2d 1390, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 135 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant had to open the screen door before the defendant could knock either on the front door or attack the poor victim. That opening action was enough to constitute a breaking. State v. Charette, 688 A.2d 1286, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 6 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The victim’s bedroom was a “dwelling” within the meaning of the law of burglary since the room had a lock on the doorknob and an additional dead-bolt lock and thus was entitled to the same level of security and protection as that afforded a dormitory room or a private apartment within a bed-and-breakfast. State v. Contreras-Cruz, 765 A.2d 849, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 36 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Multiple Offenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is nothing inconsistent with finding a defendant guilty of both assault with a dangerous weapon and burglary, and acquitting him of assault with intent to commit murder, where the jury finds an entry with the intent to commit a felony and assault with a dangerous weapon. State v. Ranieri, 586 A.2d 1094, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 36 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence, and reasonable and legitimate inferences therefrom, sufficiently established beyond reasonable doubt that defendant participated in breaking and entering without consent. See State v. Ortiz, 609 A.2d 921, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was entitled to a new trial where defense counsel’s representation was so wanting in all respects as to amount to a complete absence of a defense in that she neglected to move for a judgment of acquittal on the offense of burglary in spite of the fact that the record was devoid of any evidence that the defendant entered a dwelling with the specific intent to commit a felony therein, and that she failed to request discovery from the prosecution, to submit a request to charge any lesser-included offenses, to present any defense based upon the defendant’s intoxication, and to file a motion for a new trial prior to the expiration of the appropriate limitation period.

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The distinguishing element between a criminal trespass and breaking and entering is the element of a “break”. State v. Turner, 655 A.2d 693, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 87 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because there was eyewitness testimony from the homeowner who saw three men removing items from his home and placing them in a car, the trial court was clearly justified in finding the State’s witnesses to be credible and in rejecting defendant’s motion for a new trial in regard to defendant’s convictions for breaking and entering a dwelling and conspiracy. State v. Becote, 864 A.2d 598, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 7 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State did not have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed breaking and entering in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-8-2 to show that defendant violated his probation where defendant was arrested on that charge while on probation for breaking and entering. Rather, the presiding judicial officer only had to be “reasonably satisfied” that defendant breached a condition of probation by failing to keep the peace or remain on good behavior, and that showing was made in defendant’s case. State v. Bouffard, 945 A.2d 305, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 43 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State introduced sufficient evidence to revoke defendant’s probation, which had been granted to defendant on nine years of defendant’s 10-year sentence for breaking and entering in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-8-2. The evidence showed that defendant failed to remain on good behavior when, while on probation, defendant confronted a group, sought a fight, and threw rocks that struck a witness. Also, defendant could not challenge the original sentence as being illegal pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 because defendant did not challenge the original sentence within 120 days of that sentence being imposed. State v. Christodal, 946 A.2d 811, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 55 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a defendant’s motion to reduce sentence because the two and one-half year difference between his sentence for breaking and entering and his co-hort’s sentence was not disproportionate as they did not have to receive equal sentences and their were departure factors applicable to the defendant, which the trial justice justified in his findings such as the defendant being a career criminal, the crime turned into one of violence, he lacked remorse, and he had lied on the stand. Further, the trial court did not err by ordering the sentences for the breaking and entering, consipracy to commit breaking and entering, simple assault, and driving a motor vehicle without the permission of the owner to run consecutively rather than concurrently since the trial court justified its order by finding that it was not just a run-of-the-mill breaking and entering, the lives of the victims were changed forever, the defendant had no remorse for the crimes, and took no personal responsibility for his actions. State v. Coleman, 984 A.2d 650, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 143 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Apartments.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An indictment which charged the defendant with entering an apartment intending to commit larceny was quashed for failure to charge an offense under former § 11-8-3 as the terms “apartment” and “dwelling house” were used with specificity by the legislature in originally drafting §§ 11-8-2 and 11-8-3 as a single statute, and the legislature thus distinguished the terms by using them in contrasting ways. State v. Neary, 122 R.I. 26, 404 A.2d 65, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2060 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A common hallway in an apartment building that is collectively secured from the general public by a locked door is part of a person’s dwelling house, as that term is employed in this section. State v. Ranieri, 560 A.2d 350, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 127 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Consent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial with respect to the breaking and entering count, as the three witnesses who lived at the house testified that defendant did not have permission to be there, defendant had his own apartment and did not have keys to the victim’s home, and the victim was deemed to be a credible witness. State v. Grantley, 149 A.3d 124, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 118 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Entry.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is an entry when any part of the defendant’s person passes the line of the threshold. State v. Fernandes, 783 A.2d 913, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 217 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Force.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant, who walked through an already open door to enter a dwelling, was entitled to a judgment of acquittal since the record was devoid of any evidence that the defendant exerted force to effectuate a break-in. State v. Beeley, 653 A.2d 722, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 1 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the lack of a criminal intent requirement places the offense of unlawful breaking and entering of a dwelling house outside the realm of a violent felony, the defendant’s conviction under this section did not qualify as a burglary for purposes of federal career criminal sentencing laws. United States v. Peterson, 233 F.3d 101, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 31157 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jury Instructions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A general charge given by the trial justice fairly covered a requested charge for jury instructions where it adequately informed the jury that a “break” requires more than walking through an open door. State v. Turner, 746 A.2d 700, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 43 (R.I. 2000).</p>

Thus, defendant’s § 11-8-3 conviction was properly taken into account in classifying defendant as a career offender under § 4B1.1(a). United States v. Major, 694 F. Supp. 2d 131, 2010 U.S. Dist.

<p class="p7"><b>Elements of Crime.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There are four elements that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before a conviction can lie pursuant to this section: a break, entry, nighttime, and the intent to commit larceny. State v. Di Muccio, 431 A.2d 1212, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1182 (R.I. 1981); State v. Austin, 462 A.2d 359, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 972 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Instructions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was no error in refusing to instruct the jury to acquit defendant if they found that at the time he broke and entered a cafe he was too intoxicated to form the necessary criminal intent, where the only evidence on such defense was that he had, prior to closing of the cafe, ordered one drink, most of which the proprietor had poured out because he had failed on demand to finish it before closing time. State v. Amaral, 108 R.I. 755, 279 A.2d 428, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1337 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution under this section, the fact that “in the nighttime” was erroneously included in the trial justice’s charge in no way supplanted or diminished any of the offense’s required elements and was harmless error. State v. Johnson, 683 A.2d 373, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 251 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence of an illegal break and entry coupled with fact that several coin-operated machines located in the building were broken clearly warranted the inference that defendant entered the building with the intent to steal. State v. Austin, 462 A.2d 359, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 972 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Larceny and Embezzlement Distinguished.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The basic distinction between embezzlement and larceny is that in embezzlement, the property comes lawfully into the possession of the offender, whereas in larceny the offender takes it unlawfully in the first instance. State v. Di Muccio, 431 A.2d 1212, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1182 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Night.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where break-in occurred after 5:03 a.m. and sunrise was at 5:32 a.m., the break-in could not have been in the “nighttime” as charged, since under the inference arising from § 31-24-1 it would have been light enough at such time to see a distance of 500 feet. State v. Mollicone, 95 R.I. 59, 182 A.2d 612, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 127 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inference that defendant committed the break and entry of a cafeteria in the nighttime based on the direct evidence that a meat slicer taken in the break and entry was placed in his car outside the cafeteria at about 11 p.m. was a reasonable one and one that the jury could properly draw. State v. Di Muccio, 431 A.2d 1212, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1182 (R.I. 1981) (decided prior to 1993 amendment).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Requirements.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Neither an allegation of ownership of the building entered nor proof thereof is necessary in a prosecution under this section; all that is required is that there be sufficient identification of the premises (1) to inform the defendant of the charge against him so that he may prepare his defense, and (2) to protect him against double jeopardy. State v. Murphy, 107 R.I. 737, 271 A.2d 310, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 836 (1970).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s predicate offense qualified as “burglary” for purposes of a sentencing enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) because the defendant was convicted under the first clause of R.I.

Taylor</i>, 495 U.S. 575. Because there was a split among the circuits on the “unlawful or unprivileged” element of generic burglary under <i>Taylor</i>, and because the issue was not raised below, any error by the district court was not obvious, and therefore it was not plain error.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Due process requires that the jury must receive clear instructions that the prosecution must persuade them beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not in self-defense once the defendant produces evidence of self-defense. State v. Caron, 423 A.2d 823, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1862 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>During defendant’s trial on a charge of second-degree murder, a trial court did not err by refusing defendant’s requested instruction for the presumption of reasonable means of self-defense under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-8-8 because the statute was triggered by evidence of a breaking and entering and the victim entered through an unblocked, open door; there was no evidence the victim struck defendant to enter the house by removing an obstruction. State v. Gianquitti, 22 A.3d 1161, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 81 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Invader Not Entitled to Claim Self-Defense.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If one is feloniously present in the dwelling house of another, he may not attack the victim and then rely upon the doctrine of self-defense in order to protect himself from the consequences of his felonious presence and aggression. State v. Lamoureux, 573 A.2d 1176, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 91 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Presumption Defined.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The presumption created by this section is that the victim’s action in repelling the invader was in implementation of the right of self-defense. In re Paul F., 543 A.2d 255, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 90 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Retreat.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A person assailed in his residence by a cohabitant is not entitled to employ deadly force and kill the cohabitant assailant, but is obligated to attempt any available avenue of retreat. State v. Quarles, 504 A.2d 473, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 401 (R.I. 1986); State v. Ordway, 619 A.2d 819, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 216 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a dwelling house is entered or attempted to be entered by force and under such circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable belief that the occupant’s life is endangered or that the intruder intends to commit a felony, the occupant may use deadly force, if reasonably necessary, to prevent or terminate such entry. State v. Fetzik, 577 A.2d 990, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 138 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One who is attacked in his dwelling by one who initially entered as a social guest but who has become a trespasser by remaining after being ordered to leave is not required to retreat from the dwelling before he is permitted to use fatal force to repel an attack that he reasonably believes has placed him in imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm. State v. Walton., 615 A.2d 469, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 196 (R.I. 1992).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>— Admissibility.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Autopsy photographs of deceased child and evidence that child’s twin was admitted to hospital at same time with multiple body bruises were admissible to show mother’s tendency to abuse children. State v. Ryan, 113 R.I. 343, 321 A.2d 92, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1185 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence of the defendant’s prior shoplifting and breaking into apartments and the relation that this criminal activity bore to her compulsion to obtain cocaine was relevant to the issue of whether she possessed the requisite intent to commit the crime of wrongfully permitting her child to be a habitual sufferer and was therefore properly admitted. State v. Stewart, 663 A.2d 912, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 201 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence of the defendant’s attempt to return unused baby formula to a grocery store after the death of her child by dehydration, and her subsequently spending $20.00 given her by the store manager to purchase cocaine, tended to show the ruthless determination on her part to obtain cocaine in any circumstances and was probative of her intent to permit her son to be a habitual sufferer for want of the food and proper care that was essential for his survival, and was therefore admissible. State v. Stewart, 663 A.2d 912, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 201 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Sufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant’s repeated voluntary and intentional ingestion of crack cocaine while her seven-week-old son, who eventually died from dehydration, was in her care, in addition to her testimony that she knew that she was incapable of properly caring for her children during these extended periods of cocaine intoxication, supported a finding that she intentionally permitted her son to be a habitual sufferer for want of food and proper care. There is a distinction between “intentionally depriving” a child of food and proper care, and “intentionally permitting” a child to be a habitual sufferer for want of food or proper care. State v. Stewart, 663 A.2d 912, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 201 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Failure to Act.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By imposing criminal liability for wrongful conduct rather than for intentional conduct, the legislature expressed an intent that this section could be violated even absent a conscious purpose to cause or permit a child to be a habitual sufferer, as long as no legal justification or legal excuse existed. Thus, this section can be violated by an unintentional omission to act by one who has a duty to act, as well as by active conduct. State v. Stewart, 663 A.2d 912, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 201 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Felony Murder.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for second-degree felony murder, rather than determine if the crime of wrongfully permitting a child to be a habitual sufferer, the predicate felony underlying the felony-murder charge, was inherently dangerous in the abstract, the state had the opportunity to prove at trial that the crime was inherently dangerous in the manner that it was committed. State v. Stewart, 663 A.2d 912, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 201 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Procedure.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice committed clear error by <i>sua sponte </i>dismissing a criminal information against defendant as defendant did not file a motion to dismiss, and the trial court failed to follow the procedural rules applicable to dismissals. By prohibiting the Attorney General from fully prosecuting the felony information in violation of R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 9.1, the trial justice clearly erred and deprived the State of a fair proceeding. State v. Strom, 941 A.2d 837, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 3 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Waiver of Jury Trial.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>New trial was required because there was nothing in the record demonstrating that the trial justice was assured by defendant that her waiver of a jury trial was made intelligently and with full knowledge of the consequences of her waiver; defendant was charged with cruelty to or neglect of a child, a felony offense, and therefore she was constitutionally guaranteed a jury trial, absent a determination by the trial justice that she knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived that right.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is not unconstitutionally vague, because it clearly provided defendant with notice that his conduct was unlawful and did not create a situation where the innocent was trapped by inadequate warning. State v. Allen, 68 A.3d 512, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 110 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Commencement of Prosecution.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a conviction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-9-5.3 carried a minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-12-1.2, a prosecution for violation of the statute could only be commenced via an information or indictment, and the felony complaint filed against defendant did not commence the prosecution. It merely provided an instrument under which bail could be set. State v. Jennings, 944 A.2d 171, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 35 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a child abuse felony complaint under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-9-5.3(e) was filed against defendant in family court in June 2006, it was merely an initial bail-setting instrument, and as the information charging defendant and formally commencing the prosecution was not filed until November 2006, the July 2006 amendment to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-9-9 divested the family court of jurisdiction. State v. Jennings, 944 A.2d 171, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 35 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Conviction for first-degree child abuse was supported by sufficient evidence where the child was walking, talking, and functioning when the child’s mother left the child with defendant and the evidence presented at trial permitted a reasonable juror to conclude that the child was in defendant’s exclusive care all day, that the injury occurred when defendant was caring for the child, and that it was defendant who caused the nonaccidental head trauma. State v. Sivo, 925 A.2d 901, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 92 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-9-5.3, as currently drafted, contains the word “serious” in § 11-9-5.3(b)(2); accordingly, an adjudication that a defendant is guilty of second degree child abuse requires a determination as to whether or not the defendant inflicted a serious physical injury. State v. Sampson, 24 A.3d 1131, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 112 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Following defendant’s conviction for sexual molestation of his infant daughter in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 11-37-8.1, 11-9-5.3(b)(1), 11-9-5.3(c)(2) and 11-9-5.3(f), the trial justice articulated sufficient reasoning for agreeing with the jury and denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, based in part on defendant’s confession, which described in detail how he had inflicted the various injuries to his daughter, demonstrating personal knowledge and not speculation. State v. Baptista, 79 A.3d 24, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 146 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In convicting defendant, the victim’s half-brother, of second-degree child abuse under subsection (b)(2) of this section (“any other physical injury”), the trial justice did not need to reach the question of a lesser-included offense (simple assault) because the trial justice determined that the elements of the statute had been met; the trial justice clearly articulated a basis for his finding that the injury requirement had been met, relying on credible witness testimony from the victim, her sister, and her mother, in addition to the medical records and photographs of the victim’s injury. State v. Cahill, 196 A.3d 744, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 120 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Privilege.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a first-degree child abuse case, the trial justice did not err by requiring a licensed clinical social worker to testify about statements defendant made to her while seeking mental-health treatment because any privilege under the Confidentiality of Health Care Information Act, § 5-37.3-6, was rendered a nullity by § 40-11-11, which unambiguously abrogated all privileges that might otherwise attach to communications between any professional person and his or her patient or client in situations involving known or suspected child abuse or neglect and any such privileges could not justify a failure to give or accept evidence in any judicial proceeding relating to child abuse or neglect. State v. Lefebvre, 198 A.3d 521, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 5 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court had jurisdiction over defendant’s criminal trial for child abuse. State v. Sivo, 925 A.2d 901, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 92 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a felony prosecution commences only after a charge by information, the prosecution for violating R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-9-5.3 was not pending as of the 2006 amendment of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-9-9 because the state had not filed the information until more than three months after the amendment removed jurisdiction to the Superior Court. The Family Court properly dismissed the prosecution for lack of jurisdiction. State v. Machado, 944 A.2d 865, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 41 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jury Instruction on Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A failure to instruct the jury on intent as a necessary element of the crime of child abuse is reversible error; intent is established if a person acts purposely, knowingly or recklessly with respect to the allegedly abusive acts. State v. Lima, 546 A.2d 770, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 87 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-9-5.3 requires only that a person knowingly inflict a serious bodily injury upon a child and does not require that the person do some further act, attain some additional consequences, or have the subjective purpose to seriously injure the child, it is a general-intent crime, and the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that it could convict defendant if the jurors found that defendant acted intentionally, regardless of whether defendant had the specific intent to bring about the particular result. State v. Sivo, 925 A.2d 901, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 92 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Second-Degree Felony Murder.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the indictment did not expressly charge defendant with second-degree felony murder or with felony child abuse and the trial justice gave an instruction on second-degree felony murder using felony child abuse as the predicate felony, (1) defendant was not deprived of fair notice and an opportunity to present a meaningful defense; and (2) there was substantial evidence for the jury to determine that defendant committed an inherently dangerous felony when he hit the six-year-old victim in the stomach. State v. Patino, 188 A.3d 646, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I.), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 490, 202 L. Ed. 2d 384, 2018 U.S. LEXIS 6674 (2018).</p>

Gen. Laws § 11-9-9 divested the Family Court of jurisdiction. State v. Jennings, 944 A.2d 171, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 35 (R.I. 2008).</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The use of tobacco by Rhode Island children is a health and substance abuse problem of the utmost severity. The legislature finds that tobacco product usage by children in Rhode Island is rampant and increasing with over thirty percent (30%) of high school students smoking. The present law prohibiting the sale of tobacco to children is being ignored by many retailers. Rhode Island tobacco retailers illegally sell four million eight hundred thousand (4,800,000) packs, over eleven million dollars ($11,000,000) in tobacco product sales, to children annually. Tobacco industry advertising targets children as the replacement smokers for the one thousand one hundred forty-five (1,145) adults who die daily from tobacco product usage. Approximately seventy percent (70%) of the Rhode Island high school seniors who are smoking today will be the addicted adult smokers of tomorrow. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), smoking-related direct medical costs in Rhode Island in 1990 climbed to one hundred eighty-six million dollars ($186,000,000). This is an ongoing, escalating financial burden borne by every business, large and small, and every person, smoker and nonsmoker, in Rhode Island. This is a health and economic drain created by each new generation of children who begin using tobacco products and become addicted to nicotine. It is the intent of this legislation to preserve and protect the health of children by: (1) stopping the illegal sale of tobacco to children, and (2) by severely punishing those who disregard the laws relating to the illegal sale of tobacco products to children.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court rejected defendant’s argument that he could not be constitutionally convicted under this section for fellatio because the statute is so vague and uncertain as to violate his due process rights, reasoning that since the judicial construction in State v. Milne, 95 R.I. 315, 187 A.2d 136 (1962), appeal dismissed, 373 U.S. 542, 83 S. Ct. 1539, 10 L. Ed. 2d 687 (1963) held that fellatio falls within the statutory proscription, defendant had clear notice that his conduct was criminal under this section as construed. State v. Levitt, 118 R.I. 32, 371 A.2d 596, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1426 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was convicted pursuant to this section of having forced victim to perform fellatio, he could not challenge the constitutionality of the statute as applied hypothetically to consenting adults. State v. Levitt, 118 R.I. 32, 371 A.2d 596, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1426 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is not unconstitutional because it is impermissibly vague and does not deprive defendants of their constitutional right of privacy. State v. Gibbons, 418 A.2d 830, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1732 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Criminal prosecution under this section of an unmarried consenting heterosexual adult who engages in an act of cunnilingus is not prohibited by the constitutional right to equal protection of the laws. State v. Chiaradio, 660 A.2d 276, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 184 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Right to Privacy.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The right of privacy is inapplicable to the private unnatural copulation between unmarried adults. State v. Santos, 122 R.I. 799, 413 A.2d 58, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1473 (1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A decision of unmarried adults to engage in private consensual sexual activities is not of such a fundamental nature and is not so implicit in the concept of ordered liberty as to warrant its inclusion in the guarantee of personal privacy. Therefore, the prosecution of an unmarried person for a violation of this section was constitutional. State v. Lopes, 660 A.2d 707, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 175 (R.I. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1123, 116 S. Ct. 934, 133 L. Ed. 2d 861, 1996 U.S. LEXIS 1105 (1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court was of the opinion that when the provisions of this section are read in the context of the entire title, the legislative intent becomes obvious that all unnatural sexual copulation was to be made unlawful along with normal extra-marital sexual intercourse. State v. Milne, 95 R.I. 315, 187 A.2d 136, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 167 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Legislature purposely chose the term “crime against nature” to achieve a degree of comprehensiveness that would not have been possible with an enumeration. State v. Santos, 122 R.I. 799, 413 A.2d 58, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1473 (1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the legislative purpose in enacting title 11 was to proscribe all natural copulation that takes place outside of the marriage status, this section in this light necessarily proscribes all unnatural sexual copulation. State v. Santos, 122 R.I. 799, 413 A.2d 58, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1473 (1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is intended to punish a wide variety of unnatural acts of sexual copulation. State v. McParlin, 422 A.2d 742, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1853 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— With Sexual Assault Statute.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In enacting chapter 37 of title 11, it is clear that the legislature did not intend to pardon any of the activity that is covered under this section. Accordingly, this section retains viability notwithstanding the enactment of the sexual-assault statute in chapter 37 of title 11. State v. Souza, 456 A.2d 775, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 815 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The offense of an abominable and detestable crime against nature is a lesser included offense of the offense of first-degree sexual assault, where the physical act required to consummate both offenses is identical and the only difference is a material factual dispute concerning whether the acts are consensual in nature or the result of force or coercion. State v. Yates, 571 A.2d 575, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 1990).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The act of anal intercourse for which defendant was convicted, being an act of “unnatural sexual copulation,” was clearly proscribed by this section. State v. Santos, 122 R.I. 799, 413 A.2d 58, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1473 (1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Consent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Consent is not a defense to a charge of a crime against nature under this section. State v. Lopes, 660 A.2d 707, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 175 (R.I. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1123, 116 S. Ct. 934, 133 L. Ed. 2d 861, 1996 U.S. LEXIS 1105 (1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Effect of Amendments.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice did not err in determining that the preservation of abominable and detestable crime against nature charges against the defendant would have been inconsistent with the manifest intention of the legislature to decriminalize sodomy between consenting adults and that such preservation would be repugnant to the statute as amended. State v. Mullen, 740 A.2d 783, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 195 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence — Admissibility.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Testimony regarding the defendant’s harassment of the victim is relevant, material, and reasonably necessary to prove his consciousness of guilt, where the defendant’s harassment is well documented and his threats are corroborated by the victim’s neighbor. State v. Woodson, 551 A.2d 1187, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 153 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Fellatio and Cunnilingus.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fellatio is criminal under the provisions of this section and therefore is an indecent act within the purview of the pertinent provisions of § 11-34-5. State v. Milne, 95 R.I. 315, 187 A.2d 136, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 167 (1962); State v. Santos, 122 R.I. 799, 413 A.2d 58, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1473 (1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although both fellatio and cunnilingus are crimes against nature, they are distinct in definition. Fellatio is “the offense committed with the male sexual organ and the mouth.” Cunnilingus is an act of sex perversion committed with the mouth and the female sex organ. State v. McParlin, 422 A.2d 742, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1853 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Indictment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word sodomy when used in conjunction with the charge of “committing an abominable and detestable crime against nature” is nothing more than surplusage. State v. Castore, 435 A.2d 321, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1335 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where criminal information charged defendant with the commission of “the abominable and detestable crime against nature, sodomy” the term “sodomy” was nothing more than surplusage and need not have been established by the state to obtain a conviction under this section where another “abominable and detestable crime against nature” was proven during the course of the trial. State v. Castore, 435 A.2d 321, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1335 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Penetration.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In proving the element of penetration, the state is not required to offer evidence corroborating that of the complainant and the testimony of the complainant was sufficient to sustain defendant’s conviction even though a physician who examined the complainant several weeks after the alleged assault testified he found no evidence of penetration. State v. Correia, 106 R.I. 655, 262 A.2d 619, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 970 (1970).</p>

R. Civ. P. 8, the court found that the catchall phrase “any writing whatsoever purporting to contain evidence of any debt, contract, or promise” in R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-17-1 arguably encompassed the annuity applications, which contained evidence of a promise. W. Reserve Life Assur. Co. v. Caramadre, 847 F. Supp. 2d 329, 2012 U.S. Dist.

<p class="p7"><b>Uttering and Publishing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the provisions of the forgery statute, the crime of forgery and the crime of uttering and publishing are separate offenses, since the forger need not be the utterer, the utterer need not be the forger, and neither are even required to be aware of the other.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the defendant was charged in the state’s criminal information with only the crime of uttering and publishing four checks, and not with the forging of the checks, the trial justice’s supplemental instruction after a request for clarification from the jury, in which he instructed them that the defendant could be found guilty of forgery, constituted both clear and prejudicial error. State v. Oliveira, 730 A.2d 20, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 115 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not entitled to a new trial on the charge of uttering and publishing, where the trial justice conducted a proper review of the trial proceedings and explained that the trial justice did not believe defendant’s testimony and that the jury was within its domain as fact-finder to credit the state’s witness’ version of events, that defendant knew the check was a forgery when defendant asked the witness to deposit the check in the witness’ bank account.

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of the fraud and false dealing statute is to protect the named public and private entities from fraud and deceit. State v. Salvatore, 763 A.2d 985, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 1 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction With Other Law.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Neither this section nor § 11-18-6 relate to the protection of the same interest as does § 19-19-1 because the two misdemeanor statutes are designed to control external transmissions of false information whereas the felony statute is designed to protect the integrity of the internal records of a bank for the protection of its depositors; therefore, neither of the misdemeanors bears the necessary inherent relationship to the felony offense to make it a lesser included offense. State v. Mollicone, 654 A.2d 311, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 39 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was no evidence that a physician reported any false information in preparing a death certificate, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 11-18-1(a), 23-3-16(c), or 23-4-7, as plaintiff failed to establish that the decedent’s death was caused by any condition not listed on the death certificate and failed to present sufficient evidence showing any “suspicion of accident” or that the death occurred in an “unusual manner” or in any “unnatural manner, or as the apparent result of the negligence of another person.” Malinou v. Miriam Hosp., 24 A.3d 497, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 94 (R.I. 2011).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Defenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 28-5-7, which prohibits an employer from inquiring about any criminal charges, does not provide an absolute defense to a charge of filing a false document under this section. The fact that the question on the job application may have been improper does not permit the applicant to lie. State v. Ricci, 668 A.2d 320, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 287 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence Sufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Offense is complete if account known to be false and intended to deceive town is presented, even though no money was obtained as a result thereof. State v. Barrette, 124 A. 657, 1924 R.I. LEXIS 93 (R.I. 1924).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant, former superintendent of a town’s department of public works, was found guilty of violating this section where evidence demonstrated that he had drawn up a “sham” requisition order indicating purchase of three truck tires, the delivery of which he was unable to establish, where purchase price matched that of five automobile tires purchased with town funds and placed on defendant’s personal automobile. State v. Chatell, 121 R.I. 528, 401 A.2d 436, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1866 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Circumstantial evidence alone may be sufficient to prove conspiracy in filing a false document beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Smith, 662 A.2d 1171, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 194 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice applied the proper standard in finding that there was sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find the defendant guilty of the charge of filing a false document since he found that witness testimony and the document signed by the defendant, taken in the light most favorable to the state, was sufficient to prove the elements of fraud proscribed by this provision.

<p class="p7"><b>Evidence — Sufficiency.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence justified conviction of knowingly having in possession a slip or paper used in game of policy-lottery, where it was shown that slip in defendant’s possession was a record of drawing. State v. Gaines, 32 R.I. 462, 79 A. 1107, 1911 R.I. LEXIS 55 (1911).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was convicted for possession of lottery slips, admission of a slip of paper with the notation “6 days” was sufficient to connect it with carrying on a lottery game on the basis of the testimony of the detective who participated in the raid even if other numbers on the slip were not policy lottery numbers and if there was error in admitting this slip, it was not prejudicial error. State v. Sangermano, 111 R.I. 196, 301 A.2d 80, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1197 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Indictment or Complaint.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The complaint does not need to allege that the possession of the lottery slips was for an unlawful purpose. The statute makes it a criminal offense, subject to the exception specifically provided, for any person knowingly to have lottery slips in his possession whatever the purpose of that possession may be. It is the possession without more which constitutes the offense, and not possession accompanied by an unlawful purpose. State v. Tutalo, 99 R.I. 14, 205 A.2d 137, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 37 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>“Possession.”</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “possession” as used in the statute does not require that an accused be the owner of or have a qualified property right in the lottery slips as distinguished from having them in hand. The violation is not concerned with whether the violator was the possessor of a property right in the lottery slips or was the custodian of such slips. State v. Tutalo, 99 R.I. 14, 205 A.2d 137, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 37 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fact that lottery slips found on defendant all related to bets placed on events that had already transpired was no defense to prosecution under this section. State v. Scotti, 104 R.I. 683, 248 A.2d 327, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 707 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is possession without more of a lottery slip which constitutes an offense under this section, and not possession accompanied by an unlawful purpose. State v. Scotti, 104 R.I. 683, 248 A.2d 327, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 707 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a conviction for possession of lottery slips, the testimony of the detective who participated in the raid was sufficient to establish identification and prove that slips were in substantially the same condition as at the time of the raid so that they could be admitted as evidence. State v. Sangermano, 111 R.I. 196, 301 A.2d 80, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1197 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Probable Cause.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Information from reliable informer that defendant was seen in possession of lottery tickets and that he would be at backstretch of the race track that afternoon because his companion, a bookie, carried on his business there did not justify a reasonable inference that at 5 p.m. of that afternoon defendant would have the tickets on his person; accordingly, there was no probable cause for his arrest at that time. State v. Roach, 106 R.I. 280, 259 A.2d 119, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 624 (1969).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was arrested in a small variety store that he operated and charged with a violation of this section, the finding of a yellow slip of paper with a recorded bet thereon, the presence of a brown paper bag, and the information from an alleged reliable informer that defendant “carried the action and the money in a brown paper bag,” was sufficient to constitute probable cause for defendant’s arrest and to support a conviction for a violation of this section and there was no error in denying a motion for a directed verdict for violation of this section. State v. Doukales, 111 R.I. 443, 303 A.2d 769, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1226 (1973).</p>

In the exercise of that right the legislature may, with limitations, and even in criminal cases, provide that when certain facts have been proved, they shall be prima facie or presumptive evidence of other facts; where the inference is not purely arbitrary and there is a rational relation between the two facts, and the accused is not deprived of a proper opportunity to submit all the facts bearing upon the issue, the statute does not violate the requirements of due process of law.

<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was no showing that defendant’s premises were put for the purpose of gambling therein, the alleged unlawful use did not constitute violation of the section although evidence of telephone calls made by persons betting on horses and written evidence of number pool operations was available and racing forms and thousands of number policy slips were found in garage. State v. Hindle, 108 R.I. 389, 275 A.2d 915, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1279 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the defendant owned and operated a cafe where police officers found betting slips, newspapers turned to the racing section, and received a telephone call on a pay telephone in which callers attempted to place a bet, the fact that the defendant’s cafe was a place open to the public did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly kept the cafe as a place designed to be used by persons assembled therein for the purpose of gambling and such evidence was not sufficient for conviction under this section. State v. Zajac, 111 R.I. 397, 303 A.2d 368, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1218 (1973).</p>

State v. Doukales, 111 R.I. 443, 303 A.2d 769, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1226 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Keeping and Using.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Charge.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An indictment for violation of this section is sufficient if it alleges that the defendant dealt “faro”, “a certain banking game where money and other property was then and there dependent on the result”, since such an allegation excludes any assumption that the indictment may be proved and the defendant still innocent. State v. Melville, 11 R.I. 417, 1877 R.I. LEXIS 9 (1877).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An indictment charging violation of this section in the words of the statute was not defective for failing to allege that the defendant “then and there” kept the room to be used for gambling.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the Rhode Island Supreme Court received more than 40 nearly identical petitions for writ of certiorari seeking review of the superior court’s denial of the respective petitioner’s postconviction relief application, all the petitions for writ of certiorari were denied as the statutes for murder, first-degree sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, third-degree sexual assault, first-degree child molestation sexual assault, and second-degree child molestation sexual assault were not unconstitutional for setting out the prohibited conduct in one section of a chapter in Rhode Island’s General Laws, and setting out the penalty in the subsequent section because that arrangement did not somehow render those statutes without legal force and effect. In re Writ of Certiorari Seeking Review of Denials of Applications, 219 A.3d 320, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 124 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Aider and Abettor.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there is overwhelming evidence that the defendant did more than sit idly by while his codefendant committed a murder and that the defendant shared in his codefendant’s criminal intent, the trial justice is correct in allowing the jury to decide whether or not the defendant aided and abetted his codefendant’s criminal activity. State v. Tarvis, 465 A.2d 164, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1076 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A jury instruction on aiding and abetting which omitted any reference to the “intent of the principal” and referred only to the “criminal intent” was not improper where, before giving the instruction, the trial justice instructed the jury on the charge of murder, including the element of intent. Then, following the aiding and abetting instruction, the trial justice explained the element of intent. State v. Leuthavone, 640 A.2d 515, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 119 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a murder prosecution, the trial court’s aiding and abetting instruction accurately reflected the law with respect to intent because it explained that only if defendant knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted could he be held responsible for the natural or probable consequences of that act. Thus, his due process rights were not violated by a conclusive or burden-shifting presumption. State v. Delestre, 35 A.3d 886, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 6 (R.I.), cert. denied, 566 U.S. 1015, 132 S. Ct. 2442, 182 L. Ed. 2d 1071, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 3824 (2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>That an applicant’s accomplice was the shooter and was convicted of second-degree murder did not preclude the applicant’s conviction and sentence for first-degree murder, because under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-1-3, an aider and abettor could be convicted of a more serious offense and suffer a greater penalty than the principal. Jaiman v. State, 55 A.3d 224, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 137 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Severance.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice properly denied a severance motion made by a defendant charged with aiding and assisting in a commission of murder, who was seeking a separate trial from the codefendant charged with the principal crime. See State v. Vasquez, 620 A.2d 1248, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 37 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Bail.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although first-degree murder is the only crime which carries a mandatory life sentence under § 11-23-2, defendant may be denied bail under R.I. Const., art. I, § 9 even for crimes not enumerated in this section where death or life imprisonment could possibly be imposed as penalties for the crime committed. Fountaine v. Mullen, 117 R.I. 262, 366 A.2d 1138, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1622 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Battered-Woman’s Syndrome.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the issue of battered-woman’s syndrome is raised as a defense in a criminal trial, the state will not be required to disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, a defendant will be required to prove existence of the condition as an affirmative defense by a fair preponderance of the evidence. The defendant must bear the burden to prove the existence of facts that would constitute the battered-woman’s syndrome defense. McMaugh v. State, 612 A.2d 725, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 181 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Common Law Definition.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Murder in this state is entirely statutory but the statute does not change the crime from what it was at common law. State v. Jefferds, 89 R.I. 272, 152 A.2d 231, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 78 (1959).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mandatory death provisions of this section violate the prohibition in U.S. Const., amend. 8 against cruel and unusual punishments. State v. Anthony, 121 R.I. 954, 398 A.2d 1157, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2285 (1979), vacated, 448 A.2d 744, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 963 (R.I. 1982); State v. Cline, 121 R.I. 299, 397 A.2d 1309, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1774 (1979) (decided prior to 1984 amendment).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A mandatory life sentence for first-degree murder is not cruel and unusual punishment. State v. Vaccaro, 121 R.I. 788, 403 A.2d 649, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1981 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though the penalty of execution has been determined to be constitutionally impermissible the intention of the legislature to create a specific and separate category of crime by the third sentence of this section is clear and phrase in indictment “while committed to confinement . . . in violation of . . . § 11-23-2” was not required to be stricken. State v. Cline, 122 R.I. 297, 405 A.2d 1192, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2159 (1979) (decided prior to 1984 amendment).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In evaluating the Rhode Island sentencing procedures in regard to the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without parole, the penalty cannot be equated with that of death, and cases involving the death penalty are of limited usefulness in assessing the constitutionality of a sentence of a term of life imprisonment without parole. State v. Lassor, 555 A.2d 339, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 33 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no constitutional limitation upon the power of the legislature to define one of the aggravating circumstances as murder commited in the course of a robbery, even though such a definition would be applicable to felony murder. State v. Travis, 568 A.2d 316, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 6 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s constitutional rights were not violated because the Rhode Island Legislature, by enacting the mandatory sentencing scheme in R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2, did not usurp the judicial power by depriving the trial justice of his or her sentencing discretion as it was for the Legislature, not the courts, to prescribe the scope of punishments. Sosa v. State, 949 A.2d 1014, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 77 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the penalties for murder listed in this provision are enumerated in the alternative, a jury’s finding that aggravated battery or torture was present under subsection (b)(4) is sufficient to authorize a judge to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without parole regardless of whether subsection (b)(3) is interpreted to apply to the person who arranged for a killing or only to the person who actually executed it. State v. Pacheco, 763 A.2d 971, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 3 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Bail.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although first-degree murder is the only crime which carries a mandatory life sentence under this section, defendant may be denied bail pursuant to R.I. Const., art. I, § 9 even for crimes where death or life imprisonment could possibly be imposed as penalties for the crime committed. Fountaine v. Mullen, 117 R.I. 262, 366 A.2d 1138, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1622 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Life Without Parole.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state has the burden of proof regarding torture or aggravated battery for a sentence of life without parole. State v. Smith, 602 A.2d 931, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 18 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice was within her discretion in imposing the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole where, confronted with a first-time offender found guilty of a particularly gruesome and heinous murder, she carefully considered the nature of the offense and the personal character and propensities of the offender and concluded that he would “never change from the completely evil person that he is.” State v. Tassone, 749 A.2d 1112, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 101 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice did not err in imposing sentences of life without parole upon the defendant for having participated in the murder of two children where the evidence demonstrated his knowledge of the potential presence of children in the house, where his actions in pouring and igniting gasoline in the dead of night represented conduct creating a great risk of death to more than one person, and where no evidence of any mitigating factors emerged at trial. State v. Garcia, 743 A.2d 1038, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 14 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state met its burden of proof of demonstrating torture or aggravated battery sufficient to support a sentence of life without parole since the evidence showed that the victim fell to the ground after a blow to her head with a metal bar, and that she was hit again and then stabbed and cut repeatedly while she was still conscious. State v. Pacheco, 763 A.2d 971, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 3 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Enlargements of injury photographs were admissible since the state sought a life sentence without parole for the defendant and they provided direct evidence relevant to proving the element of torture or aggravated battery. State v. Belloli, 766 A.2d 928, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 52 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1, and the evidence overwhelmingly supported the jury’s verdict, there was support for the imposition of a life sentence without the possibility of parole, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2; in conducting a review of the sentence imposed pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 12-19.2-4 and 12-19.2-5, the mitigating factors, the findings of the trial justice, and the personal character, record, and propensities of defendant did not outweigh the aggravating factors that were established. State v. Motyka, 893 A.2d 267, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 36 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>First-degree murder defendant was properly sentenced to life imprisonment without parole as the victim’s slow, terrifying, and agonizing death justified the jury in finding the aggravating factors set forth in R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2; defendant had 10 convictions in Rhode Island since 1995, including driving violations, drug offenses, and assaultive behavior; and defendant showed no remorse and took no responsibility for his actions. State v. Brown, 898 A.2d 69, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 78 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a murder case, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2(1) permitted the trial justice to impose four consecutive life sentences as a result of defendant’s participation in a carjacking that resulted in the death of a young couple; the justice properly concluded that the brutality of the murders alone justified a life sentence without parole, even though acknowledging that defendant had had a troubled childhood, because the justice emphasized that defendant possessed a free will and a modicum of intelligence. State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 91 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s sentence of life without parole for the first-degree murder of his wife was proper, as defendant repeatedly stabbed his wife as the she lay crouched in a fetal position on the floor, vulnerable and defenseless, and continued to stab her even after rendering her helpless. State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 21 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice in determining whether to impose a life sentence without the possibility of parole, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2(3), appropriately asked the jury to determine whether the killing of the victim was a murder for hire because ample evidence was presented at trial that defendant killed the victim at the request of the victim’s brother-in-law in exchange for money, and there was no requirement that defendant was to have been paid in advance for the murder. State v. Graham, 941 A.2d 848, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 22 (R.I.), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 848, 129 S. Ct. 99, 172 L. Ed. 2d 82, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 6960 (2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that the murder was committed in a manner involving torture or aggravated battery to the victim, a sentence of life in prison without the possibility for parole was appropriate. Page v. State, 995 A.2d 934, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 67 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole was appropriate, where the evidence showed, inter alia, that the murder was committed in a manner involving both torture and aggravated battery to the victim; the inmate’s actions served as signal to other potential informants they would not only be killed should they choose to inform, but that they would die in the torment that the victim did; and the inmate had a prior criminal history that included no fewer than 10 criminal charges. State v. Sifuentes, 996 A.2d 1130, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 80 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s sentence of life imprisonment without parole, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2, was appropriate because defendant brutally murdered a twenty-seven-year law enforcement veteran with the officer’s own firearm, abused drugs, had a history of violent crime, and any hope of defendant’s rehabilitation was far outweighed by his danger to the community. State v. Carpio, 43 A.3d 1, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 62 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was appropriate considering defendant’s lack of remorse and the extreme brutality evident in the murder, where the victim was stabbed 40 times with a serrated knife. The brutal slaying undoubtedly fell within the definition of aggravated battery. State v. Lopez, 45 A.3d 1, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 91 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant, convicted of the first-degree murder of his girlfriend, was properly sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, because the evidence supported the jury’s finding that he committed the murder with aggravated battery and torture, as well as the trial court’s finding that his character and propensities made it unlikely that he would be rehabilitated. State v. Martinez, 59 A.3d 73, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 20 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Practice and Procedure.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Nothing in this section forbids granting counsel an opportunity to argue to the jury prior to its deliberation on the existence or nonexistence of an aggravating circumstance. In fact, the section should be construed as permitting such argument to be made. State v. Lassor, 555 A.2d 339, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 33 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A defendant should be given the opportunity to present any reasonably relevant factors as mitigating circumstances to the trial justice. The trial justice may then determine whether such mitigating circumstances should result in his or her declining to impose the penalty of life imprisonment without parole. State v. Travis, 568 A.2d 316, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 6 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice’s failure to define the terms “torture” and “aggravated battery” for the jury do not constitute error that invalidates the finding of that aggravating circumstance by the jury. State v. Travis, 568 A.2d 316, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 6 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Murder was committed in a manner involving torture or aggravated battery to the victim, where the victim was subjected to twenty-three stab wounds, and the victim’s hands were bound behind her back so that at least a portion of the brutal stabbing could be inferred to have taken place after she had been rendered helpless to resist. State v. Travis, 568 A.2d 316, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 6 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant waived the right to a jury trial and was found guilty of domestic murder in the first degree, the trial judge had authority to impose a life imprisonment sentence without parole where she found an aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt; there was no requirement that R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2 had to be included in the indictment because the Attorney General had given notice of his intent to seek such penalty within 20 days of the arraignment, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-19.2-1 and such notice satisfied due process. State v. Edwards, 810 A.2d 226, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 217 (R.I. 2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 980, 123 S. Ct. 1808, 155 L. Ed. 2d 670, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 2991 (2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the imposition of a consecutive life sentence on a serial killer was otherwise legal, but the original sentencing court failed to allow an opportunity for allocution until after sentence had already been imposed, the sentencing court committed error in failing to vacate and resentence; the resulting sentence was only illegally imposed, however, rather than illegal, so that it could only be challenged within the 120-day time limit provided by rule. State v. DeCiantis, 813 A.2d 986, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 16 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not entitled to a correction of his sentence of life imprisonment because once defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2, the sentence of life imprisonment was not only authorized by law, it was mandatory. State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 34 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As the trial court heard the R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 motion to reduce sentence and concluded that there were no mitigating circumstances warranting a sentence reduction of the defendant’s life sentence for second degree murder related to his inadvertent shooting of a bystander, instead, it focused on the impact of defendant’s actions had on the victim’s family, defendant failed to establish that the trial court improperly denied the motion and that his sentence was without justification. State v. Mendoza, 958 A.2d 1159, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Presentence Reports.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The enactment of § 12-19-6, providing for a presentence investigation and report did not repeal by implication the mandatory life imprisonment provision of this section, but such section would not be applicable to a conviction of murder in the first degree.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The definition of manslaughter remains as it was at common law. State v. Pine, 524 A.2d 1104, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 463 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Essential Elements.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An essential element of this offense is the presence of provocation offered by person slain. State v. Winston, 105 R.I. 447, 252 A.2d 354, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 774 (1969).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>At common law, manslaughter is classified as either voluntary or involuntary. State v. Vargas, 420 A.2d 809, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1817 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Voluntary manslaughter is a separate offense that is defined as an intentional homicide without malice aforethought in the heat of passion as a result of adequate provocation. State v. Vargas, 420 A.2d 809, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1817 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice aforethought, either express or implied. State v. Lillibridge, 454 A.2d 237, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1117 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Involuntary manslaughter is an unintentional homicide without malice aforethought, committed either in the performance of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony or in the performance of a lawful act with criminal negligence. State v. Lillibridge, 454 A.2d 237, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1117 (R.I. 1982); State v. Robbio, 526 A.2d 509, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 500 (R.I. 1987).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To find criminal liability for involuntary manslaughter under the criminal negligence theory, evidence of the defendant’s awareness of the victim’s peril and his failure to act are not sufficient to support a conviction. To find criminal liability for failing to act, there must first exist a legal duty to act, imposable by either the common law or by statutory mandate. State v. McLaughlin, 621 A.2d 170, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 34 (R.I.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 858, 114 S. Ct. 168, 126 L. Ed. 2d 128, 1993 U.S. LEXIS 5581 (1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Autopsy photographs of deceased child plus evidence that child’s twin was admitted to hospital at same time with multiple body bruises were admissible to show mother’s tendency to abuse children. State v. Ryan, 113 R.I. 343, 321 A.2d 92, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1185 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Failure to Provide Medical Assistance.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Criminal culpability premised on a failure to provide medical attention requires that proximate causation be established, i.e., it must appear that decedent’s death was imputable to such failure, or that life might have been prolonged if proper medical attention had been provided. State v. Wheeler, 496 A.2d 1382, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 572 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Fair Trial.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the defendant was charged with manslaughter for allegedly stabbing her husband during an argument, the prosecutor’s question to the defendant regarding an unsubstantiated allegation that the defendant had stabbed her former husband was inherently prejudicial to her right to a fair and impartial trial and its destructive impact was not cured by the cautionary instructions given to the jury by the trial justice. State v. Ordway, 619 A.2d 819, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 216 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Instructions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A person convicted of manslaughter is not prejudiced by an erroneous murder instruction. State v. Lillibridge, 454 A.2d 237, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1117 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Testimony that the defendant drank on the afternoon and evening of the murder and that the defendant drank frequently fell well short of demonstrating that the defendant’s will was so paralyzed that he was unable to withstand evil impulses or to form any sane design. Therefore, the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on manslaughter by reason of diminished capacity. State v. Johnson, 667 A.2d 523, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 265 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the evidence did not show that defendant was acting under extreme provocation of fear of violence, and where defendant also had cooling down time between earlier altercations and a final confrontation with the victim, there was no reason to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of second-degree murder. State v. McGuy, 841 A.2d 1109, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 209 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for murder in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1, defendant was not entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, as her assertion that the victim assaulted her and tried to rob her was not supported by admissible evidence, and failed to establish that she acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation. State v. Garcia, 883 A.2d 1131, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 189 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a trial for first-degree murder, defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the lesser-included offense of voluntary manslaughter, because there was no evidence presented as to defendant’s level of intoxication following defendant’s alcohol consumption and defendant’s numerous voluntary and conscious actions on the night in question illustrated that defendant’s intoxication was not of such a degree as to completely paralyze defendant’s will. State v. Motyka, 893 A.2d 267, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 36 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Self-Defense.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court properly denied the defendant’s request for a proposed instruction on self-defense that concerned the difference between the developmental skills of men and women. State v. Ordway, 619 A.2d 819, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 216 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a manslaughter case where the defendant presented evidence concerning battered woman’s syndrome, defendant’s conviction was upheld because she failed to prove, under the totality of the circumstances, that the victim was about to inflect death or serious bodily injury upon her when she grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed the victim. State v. Urena, 899 A.2d 1281, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 110 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Motion to Reduce Sentence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As defendant inmate’s sentence for two counts of manslaughter was authorized by R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-3(a), he agreed to serve it as part of a plea bargain, and the State had not moved to increase it, due process did not require that he be appointed counsel to represent him in his R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 motion to reduce his sentence. State v. Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 122 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Resentencing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A trial justice did not abuse his discretion in resentencing the defendant to the maximum term for manslaughter after having sentenced him to a term exceeding the maximum, at which time the justice had stated that if he had heard the case without a jury, his verdict would have been first degree murder, not manslaughter. State v. Gil, 543 A.2d 1296, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 77 (R.I. 1988).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A prisoner who is serving a period of confinement in a correctional institution remains in the custody of the warden during the time that the prisoner is temporarily outside the confines of the institution. That someone other than the warden is responsible for transporting or guarding the prisoner while outside the confines of the adult correctional institutions in no way diminishes the fact that the warden is ultimately responsible for and in control of the prisoner, and an escape by a prisoner during such period of transportation, constitutes a violation of this section. State v. Tregaskis, 540 A.2d 1022, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 69 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Legislative Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature clearly intended to insure the imposition of additional punishment for the crime of escape, independent of any other sentence under which a prisoner was serving or being held.

<p class="p7"><b>Original Sentence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature used the words “original term” in this section to mean the aggregate term of consecutive sentences under which the prisoner was being held at the time of the escape and it was the legislative intent that the escape sentence was to begin at the expiration of the last of such consecutive sentences. State v. D'Amico, 92 R.I. 194, 167 A.2d 542, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 10 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where legislature enacted a statute setting out that escapee from maximum custodial unit be sentenced for not less than one nor more than twenty years “except where the original sentence was imprisonment for life,” said term to commence following the expiration of the original term of such prisoner, it did not intend to favor life termer by exempting him from judicial punishment, and thus such statute in order to avoid patently absurd result would be construed as if it read that escapee be sentenced not less than one nor more than twenty years, said term to commence from the expiration of the original term of such prisoner except where the original sentence was imprisonment for life. State v. Goff, 110 R.I. 202, 291 A.2d 416, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 901 (1972); State v. Robalewski, 418 A.2d 817, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1717 (R.I. 1980).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To fall within the kidnapping statute, the confinement or imprisonment must have some independent significance from other crimes committed, and cannot be merely that confinement necessary for the commission of other crimes. A confinement that is incidental to the commission of a crime is not punishable under this section. State v. Taylor, 562 A.2d 445, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 143 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The confinement and asportation of the victim has legal significance separate and apart from sexual assaults, where, for approximately four hours and at several locations, the defendant raped the victim repeatedly, and kept his leg hooked about the victim’s leg to prevent her escape from her car. State v. Barnes, 559 A.2d 136, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 95 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The independent-significance requirement promulgated in State v. Innis, 433 A.2d 646 (R.I. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 942, 102 S. Ct. 2005, 72 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1982), is a judicially created rule designed to protect defendants against enhancement of offenses by the additional charge of kidnapping when the detention or asportation of the person is merely incidental to the commission of another crime. The implementation of this judicially treated rule is best entrusted to the trial justice and is therefore a question of law as opposed to a jury question. State v. Warner, 626 A.2d 205, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 163 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The kidnapping of a minor statute, unlike the kidnapping statute, does not require that the act of confinement have “independent significance” from the act of child-molestation sexual assault and, in fact, expressly prohibits the confinement or seizure of a child under sixteen years of age “with the intent of sexually assaulting or molesting the child.” State v. Suero, 721 A.2d 426, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 306 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that the first victim was forced into a car, thrown against the vehicle’s backseat floor, and traveled in at least three cities before being taken to wooded area, pulled out of the car, and dragged into dark woods, far exceeding what was necessary to commit a sexual assault, provided “independent significance” sufficient to support a kidnapping conviction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-26-1. State v. Pablo, 925 A.2d 894, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 72 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence supported a kidnapping charge; confining the victims to a small closet after they had been physically assaulted and sprayed with Mace and then leaving them there after the robberies were completed exposed the victims to a greater harm than the robberies initially posed. The confinement clearly exceeded that necessary for the commission of the robberies, could not be classified as having been merely incidental to the robberies, and made it significantly more difficult for the victims to escape, thereby concealing defendant’s criminal activity for a time. State v. Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d 12, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 55 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Historical Background.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For a discussion of the common law and legislative history of the law relating to kidnapping, see State v. Innis, 433 A.2d 646, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1238 (R.I. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 930, 102 S. Ct. 1980, 72 L. Ed. 2d 447, 1982 U.S. LEXIS 1754 (1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>“Inveiglement” Defined.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Inveiglement” means to persuade a person to do something bad or hurtful by deceptive acts or by flattery, to seduce, to lead astray by false representations or other deceitful means. There need be no physical force, but mental control such as an instillation of fear is sufficient to satisfy the element of inveiglement. State v. Collins, 543 A.2d 641, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 1988), overruled, State v. Rios, 702 A.2d 889, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 295 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Lack of Consent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The requirement of lack of consent by the victim was satisfied by defendant’s deceit or misrepresentation in enticing the victim to accompany him. State v. Collins, 543 A.2d 641, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 1988), overruled, State v. Rios, 702 A.2d 889, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 295 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Multiple Offenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state, by proving the elements of the crime of kidnapping, does not automatically prove the crime of assault with a dangerous weapon used in the kidnapping; therefore, the offenses do not merge under the double-jeopardy clause. State v. Ballard, 439 A.2d 1375, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 796 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>“Secretly Confined” Defined.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant “secretly confined” the victim, by concealing him from lawful authorities interested in enforcing the laws of their respective states, where the victim was held in circumstances making it highly likely that neither the police nor his parents would ever find him. State v. Collins, 543 A.2d 641, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 1988), overruled, State v. Rios, 702 A.2d 889, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 295 (R.I. 1997).</p>

Consequently, to the extent that R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><b>Title Insurers.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Title insurer and agents did not engage in the unauthorized practice of law by conducting real estate closings because no harm was shown, and this century-old statutorily authorized practice did not subvert the authority of the Rhode Island Supreme Court to determine what is, and is not, the practice of law.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To avoid engaging in the unauthorized practice of law, a non-attorney closing agent must: (1) communicate to the buyer and the seller that the closing agent is not an attorney, does not represent the buyer or the seller, cannot and will not give legal advice, and, if the buyer or seller has a legal question, the buyer or seller should suspend the closing and seek counsel from an attorney; (2) present a written notice to the buyer and seller containing these warnings, which shall be the first document presented and signed, and require the buyer and the seller to read the document, (3) require the buyer and seller to sign a copy of the notice; (4) sign the notice; and (5) retain a signed copy of the notice.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Probable cause to arrest for obstruction of justice may arise, in certain circumstances, from the spoken word rather than an actual physical interference with the police officer. De Fusco v. Brophy, 112 R.I. 461, 311 A.2d 286, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1005 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where officers responded to call concerning a disturbance, and in attempting to enforce city ordinance were met with shouting of obscenities at the officers for eight or nine minutes, evidence was sufficient for jury to find that officers had probable cause to arrest such persons for obstructing an officer. Johnson v. Palange, 122 R.I. 361, 406 A.2d 360, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1551 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality of Official Action.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The constitutionality of a regulation does not affect the duty of a citizen to obey a police officer enforcing the regulation. State v. Duffy, 441 A.2d 524, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 800 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Execution of Official Duty.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>With respect to defendant’s conviction for obstruction of a firefighter, defendant’s return to the basement stairs after being removed from a home certainly impeded a fire lieutenant in the execution of his official duty. State v. Greenslit, 135 A.3d 1192, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 35 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Indictment or Complaint.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An indictment or complaint under this statute violates due process afforded by U.S. Const., amend. 14 and R.I. Const., art. 1, § 10 where it does not aver that the defendant knew the officer to be an officer when he obstructed him. State v. Drew, 112 R.I. 129, 308 A.2d 516, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 963 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the case of a complaint for a violation of an obstructing-justice statute, four elements must be averred for it not to be constitutionally defective. The complaint must state: (1) that the defendant acted knowingly, (2) that the defendant “resisted” or “obstructed” a peace officer, (3) that the defendant knew the peace officer was in fact a peace officer, and (4) that the peace officer was performing an authorized act within his official capacity. State v. Berberian, 416 A.2d 127, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1657 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of obstructing officers in executing their duty because the lieutenant testified that defendant defied the officers’ authority and used every effort to avoid handcuffs; and the lieutenant testified that the second officer came to his assistance and as a result of defendant’s actions, a scuffle occurred where punches were thrown and force was exchanged.

Written notice and an opportunity for a hearing shall be afforded to persons appearing to have an interest in the motor vehicle. The hearing is limited to the issues of whether:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> There is a substantial probability that the law enforcement agency will prevail on the issue of forfeiture and that failure to enter the order will result in the motor vehicle being destroyed, conveyed, encumbered or further encumbered, removed from the jurisdiction of the court, or otherwise made unavailable for forfeitures; and</p>

Following the entry of an order declaring the property forfeited, the court may, upon application of the law enforcement agency, enter any appropriate orders, require the execution of satisfactory performance bonds, appoint receivers, conservators, appraisers, accountants, or trustees, or take any other action to protect the interest of the law enforcement agency in the motor vehicle ordered forfeited.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> All right, title, and interest in the motor vehicle described in § 11-34-8.1 vests in the city or town upon the commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this section subject to the limitations of § 11-34-8.2. Any such motor vehicle that is subsequently transferred to any person may be the subject of a special verdict of forfeiture and thereafter shall be ordered forfeited to the state, unless the transferee establishes in a hearing that he or she is a bona fide purchaser for value of the motor vehicle who at the time of purchase was reasonably without cause to believe that the motor vehicle was subject for forfeiture.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice did not err in determining that the preservation of abominable and detestable crime against nature charges against the defendant would have been inconsistent with the manifest intention of the legislature to decriminalize sodomy between consenting adults and that such preservation would be repugnant to the statute as amended. State v. Mullen, 740 A.2d 783, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 195 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Force and Coercion.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subdivision (2)(C) encompasses implied, as well as express threats. State v. Burke, 522 A.2d 725, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 433 (R.I. 1987), limited, State v. DiPetrillo, 922 A.2d 124, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 54 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the evidence tended to show that defendant, a uniformed police officer armed with handcuffs and a gun, used his position of authority to intimidate an alcoholic young woman into performing oral sex upon him, it was held that the defendant’s position of authority, in and of itself, carried with it an implied threat, and this appearance of authority, combined with the fact that defendant was armed, and the peculiar vulnerability of the victim, were sufficient to support a jury verdict that defendant coerced submission by impliedly threatening the victim within the meaning of subdivision (2)(C). State v. Burke, 522 A.2d 725, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 433 (R.I. 1987), limited, State v. DiPetrillo, 922 A.2d 124, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 54 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is an element of forcible compulsion, or the threat of forcible compulsion that would prevent resistance by a person of reasonable resolution, inherent in the situation in which an adult who is with a child who is younger, smaller, less psychologically and emotionally mature, and less sophisticated than the adult, instructs the child to submit to the performance of sexual acts. State v. St. Amant, 536 A.2d 897, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 16 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no requirement in paragraph (C) that the threat be made during the actual commission of the sexual act. State v. Maggs, 588 A.2d 601, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 43 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice properly denied defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal where the only disputed issue was the use of force or coercion. Although the defendant made no specific threats of bodily harm, a guilty verdict could still be reached based on defendant’s threats of impending anger, physical restrictions of the victim and demand for sexual acts. State v. Lamoureux, 623 A.2d 9, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 98 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A defendant who used his position of authority in the household to order his step-daughter into the bedroom and, after placing her in a position of vulnerability, engaged in sexual contact with her, made “implied threats” constituting the use of force or coercion within this meaning of this section. State v. Brown, 619 A.2d 828, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 22 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>With regard to defendant’s conviction for sexual assault wherein a trial justice found that all of the ingredients were present and his conclusion that all of the relevant hallmarks of force or coercion, both physical and psychological, were part of defendant’s misconduct, the appellate court vacated the conviction and remanded the case for the trial justice to conduct an independent examination of the evidence to determine whether the State had established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was guilty of the charged crimes based solely on physical force. Because the trial justice erroneously found force and coercion by implied threats, the appellate court was uncertain about whether defendant was convicted based on a finding of force and coercion by physical force beyond a reasonable doubt which was separate and apart from the error. State v. DiPetrillo, 922 A.2d 124, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 54 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The victim’s testimony that the defendant pulled her down, that he physically prevented her from getting away from him and that he attempted to push her legs apart with his own so that he could penetrate her is sufficient to establish that the sexual activity was “by force or coercion” rather than by consent. State v. Pignolet, 465 A.2d 176, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1080 (R.I. 1983), limited, State v. Bernier, 491 A.2d 1000, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 495 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is sufficient evidence of force to warrant submitting second degree sexual assault charges to the jury, where defendant, a schoolteacher, touched and grabbed a student unexpectedly on three occasions and there is ample proof that the student did not consent to the touchings. State v. Goodreau, 560 A.2d 318, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 96 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Jury could infer that defendant’s prior beating of the victim had the effect of coercing her to engage in a sexual act, where only a few minutes passed between the beating and the sexual act. State v. Maggs, 588 A.2d 601, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 43 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the evidence showed that defendant, a 200-pound man, physically forced the complainant, a teenage boy, to his knees for oral sex, while the teenage boy was crying and the complainant was unable to move and was in a position of helplessness, the State proved “force or coercion.” State v. Lynch, 19 A.3d 51, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 54 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Mental Disability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was accused of first-degree sexual assault of a developmentally disabled woman under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-2, the expert’s testimony was sufficient to establish that the victim was mentally disabled under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-1(4), as the expert testified that the victim lacked the ability to make informed decisions about sexual contact. State v. Gardiner, 895 A.2d 703, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 55 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Nolo Contendere Plea.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Denial of an inmate’s postconviction relief petition was proper because the inmate’s Alford plea to second-degree child molestation was voluntary, intelligent, and knowing for R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 11 purposes and the inmate was well aware of the nature of the charges against him at the time he pled to them; it was acceptable for the trial justice to rely on the prosecutor’s recitation of the State’s evidence to establish the factual basis. The inmate failed to satisfy his burden of proving that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered. Camacho v. State, 58 A.3d 182, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 10 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Penetration.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s motion for acquittal based on lack of actual penetration failed under this section, which only requires “sexual penetration,” which includes the act of cunnilingus. State v. Cembrola, 469 A.2d 362, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1124 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Repeal of Indecent Assault Law.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where in a prosecution for indecent assault pursuant to former § 11-37-6, the information was not filed until June 24, 1980, there was no prosecution pending when the legislature repealed the indecent-assault section on May 9, 1979. Therefore, the general savings clause of § 43-3-23 did not apply, and defendant’s conviction for indecent assault was reversed. State v. Souza, 456 A.2d 775, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 815 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Repeal of Rape Law.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The effect of the repeal of former § 11-37-1 (rape) and enactment of present chapter 37 of title 11 as it relates to the crime of rape was merely amendatory in nature; there was never a time when the elements of that offense were not considered criminal and capable of prosecution. State v. Babbitt, 457 A.2d 1049, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 829 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sexual Contact.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice committed reversible error in refusing to instruct the jurors that they were required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant’s contact with his niece was for the purpose of his sexual arousal, gratification, or assault, in order to convict under the second-degree sexual-assault statutes, i.e., this section and § 11-37-4. State v. Tobin, 602 A.2d 528, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 13 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The evidence was sufficient to sustain the defendant’s conviction where, regardless of any specific physical arousal of the defendant, the victim’s testimony taken as a whole clearly indicated that the defendant committed the touching for the purpose of sexual gratification. In re David G., 741 A.2d 863, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 212 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that a defendant accused of molesting his young granddaughter was impotent was not dispositive of whether he was capable of committing second-degree child molestation; sexual contact with a purpose of arousal could occur even in the absence of the ability to be physically aroused. State v. Silvia, 798 A.2d 419, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 143 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied defendant’s motions for a judgment of acquittal, R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 29, and for a new trial, R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 33, following defendant’s conviction of second-degree child molestation pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-8.3.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Defendant’s deliberate act of fondling his 10 year old stepdaughter could not be characterized as accidental and could reasonably be construed as intended by defendant for the purposes of sexual arousal or gratification, and therefore constituted sexual conduct as defined by R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-1(7). State v. Tracy, 816 A.2d 1275, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 41 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Juvenile was properly adjudicated as a delinquent for engaging in second-degree child molestation sexual assault because the evidence showed that the juvenile entered the room where the victim was sleeping on two occasions and touched the victim on the second occasion by placing the juvenile’s fingers over the victim’s vagina and underwear for the purpose of the juvenile’s sexual gratification. In re Kyle A., 137 A.3d 706, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 52 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the minor victim did not explicitly offer testimony that defendant’s hand touched her vagina in describing every occasion of sexual assault, the victim’s testimony on certain counts sufficiently referred back to an earlier assault in that defendant was “doing the same thing as the other times” and created a nexus between her testimony and the body part delineated in the statute, her genital area. State v. Cavanaugh, 158 A.3d 268, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 48 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sexual Penetration.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The definition of sexual penetration is unambiguous and specific; the Attorney General and the courts do not have unlimited discretion as to what constitutes the crime of sexual assault. When the court instructs a jury or when the state seeks an indictment, neither may exercise any discretion because this section specifically defines sexual penetration. Jacques v. State, 669 A.2d 1124, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 292 (R.I. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1212, 116 S. Ct. 1833, 134 L. Ed. 2d 937, 1996 U.S. LEXIS 3335 (1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>All that is required to establish the first-degree sexual offense of cunnilingus is for the defendant to lick or kiss the female genitalia, and penetration of the vagina is not necessary. State v. Beaulieu, 674 A.2d 377, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 98 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mere fact that a minor victim closed her lips, made a pouting motion, and exhaled during her demonstration on the stand did not necessarily indicate a lack of the requisite oral contact with the respondent’s penis for fellatio to have occurred, and the trial justice was not clearly wrong in concluding that the evidence was both legally competent and sufficient to establish the act of fellatio. In re Ryan B., 739 A.2d 232, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 188 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Victim’s testimony that defendant touched her genitalia with his mouth when he sucked on her private part was sufficient to constitute cunnilingus and thus, sexual penetration. State v. Higham, 865 A.2d 1040, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 202 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal because there was sufficient evidence of defendant’s guilt of first-degree child molestation beyond a reasonable doubt; the victim’s testimony as to the incident showed that defendant vaginally penetrated her, and the victim’s testimony, in light of her clarification, was sufficiently “precise” and “specific” to prove penetration beyond a reasonable doubt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>State v. Rainey, 175 A.3d 1169, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 5 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial after the jury found him guilty of two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault and two counts of second-degree child molestation sexual assault of his daughter, the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive any material evidence, nor did she clearly err; the trial justice applied the appropriate standard to her review of the evidence, and after finding that reasonable minds could differ with her own conclusions, she properly denied the motion. State v. Mensah, 227 A.3d 474, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 32 (R.I. 2020).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the Rhode Island Supreme Court received more than 40 nearly identical petitions for writ of certiorari seeking review of the superior court’s denial of the respective petitioner’s postconviction relief application, all the petitions for writ of certiorari were denied as the statutes for murder, first-degree sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, third-degree sexual assault, first-degree child molestation sexual assault, and second-degree child molestation sexual assault were not unconstitutional for setting out the prohibited conduct in one section of a chapter in Rhode Island’s General Laws, and setting out the penalty in the subsequent section because that arrangement did not somehow render those statutes without legal force and effect. In re Writ of Certiorari Seeking Review of Denials of Applications, 219 A.3d 320, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 124 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Common Law Rape.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Common law rape is the act of sexual intercourse committed by a man with a woman not his wife and without her consent, committed when the victim’s resistance is overcome by force or fear, or under other prohibited conditions.

Pignolet, 465 A.2d 176 (R.I. 1983), involving evidence of a defendant’s sexual conduct with a child not named in the indictment, is limited to situations in which the testimony of siblings of tender years is both necessary in order for the state to meet its burden of proof and relevant, material, and highly probative of the accused’s lecherous conduct toward the victims over whom the defendant exercised discipline, control, and supervision.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a case in which defendant was convicted of one count of first-degree sexual assault and three counts of second-degree child molestation, defendant’s motion for a new trial was properly denied because the trial justice stated that reasonable minds could differ as to what the verdict should be; the trial justice did not overlook the evidence of the victim’s potential motive for testifying as she did or the evidence that her poor relationship with defendant started only after he allegedly violated her confidence; and the trial justice did not overlook the lack of independent evidence as there was no requirement of independent corroboration for sex offense cases.

Because the trial justice erroneously found force and coercion by implied threats, the appellate court was uncertain about whether defendant was convicted based on a finding of force and coercion by physical force beyond a reasonable doubt which was separate and apart from the error.

Because it is incumbent upon the state to prove that the accused used force or coercion, the use of the audio tape offered probative evidence of such force and coercion. In regard to the use of the audio tape during the state’s direct examination of the victim, the probative value offered by this narrative exercise was to determine where each of the parties was and what each was doing at the time the tape was paused.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the defendant had lost significant weight, the state had a demonstrable need to admit mug-shot photographs as evidence of the defendant’s relative size at the time of the alleged sexual assault, a need which was not nullified by the fact that defense counsel agreed not to object to testimony regarding the defendant’s weight loss; however, where the photographs were still clearly mug shots that the public ordinarily associates with persons having some criminal record, their admission constituted error.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An indictment charging the defendant with sexual penetration of the victim in violation of §§ 11-37-2 and 11-37-3 and indicating the time and place the offense was committed set forth the charge with legal sufficiency to notify the defendant of the substantial elements of the charge and to prevent the defendant’s being put upon trial a second time for the same offense.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant’s motion for a bill of particulars because the State provided defendant with adequate notice that it intended to proceed under both theories that the victim was physically helpless and that defendant used force or coercion when he assaulted her; and the State was not under a duty to elect, prior to trial, which theory it would pursue.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An instruction on force and coercion stating that, in “a situation of an adult who is with a child”, “forcible compulsion derives from the respective capacities of the child and the adult” circumvented the state’s required burden of proof on the element of force and coercion and was error. State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 233 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Motions for judgment of acquittal and a new trial were properly denied since the trial justice’s analysis made clear that the victim’s state of mind at the time of sexual intercourse was a question of fact on which the jury could find that she was asleep and thus physically helpless during the penetration.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Jury instruction that was given in defendant’s case was not erroneous because, pursuant to established jurisprudence, there was no proper basis to apply the rule announced in a later case regarding the element of force and coercion to the final judgment in defendant’s case as the later ruling did not alter or shift the burden of proof or plow any new ground.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although defendant’s requested jury instruction on the “force or coercion” element of first-degree sexual assault under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-2 was refused and the term “lack of consent” was not explicitly utilized, a trial court’s instruction did employ the verb “overcomes,” which, when the instructions were read in their entirety, meant that as a precondition of guilt, the jury had to find a lack of consent by a victim. State v. Adefusika, 989 A.2d 467, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 31 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Jury instructions adequately apprised the jury of the operative legal concepts that were in play because the instruction adequately conveyed to the jury that, to find defendant guilty of first-degree sexual assault, it also needed to conclude that the victim did not consent to the penetration, and the trial justice did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on a consent defense that was unsupported by the testimony.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s argument that the literal language of this section does not permit one act of sexual penetration to be punished twice even if that one act results in violations of more than one subsection of this section was waived because it was never adequately and properly addressed to the trial court for its consideration.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the Rhode Island Supreme Court received more than 40 nearly identical petitions for writ of certiorari seeking review of the superior court’s denial of the respective petitioner’s postconviction relief application, all the petitions for writ of certiorari were denied as the statutes for murder, first-degree sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, third-degree sexual assault, first-degree child molestation sexual assault, and second-degree child molestation sexual assault were not unconstitutional for setting out the prohibited conduct in one section of a chapter in Rhode Island’s General Laws, and setting out the penalty in the subsequent section because that arrangement did not somehow render those statutes without legal force and effect. In re Writ of Certiorari Seeking Review of Denials of Applications, 219 A.3d 320, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 124 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Conviction Overturned.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s second-degree sexual assault conviction is vacated, where there is evidence that defendant and the thirteen-year old victim were “horsing around” or “wrestling” and the trial justice, who was not misled by a request to charge on “simple assault,” should have instructed the jury that if it found the touching to have been offensive, but not intended to be for sexual gratification, it might return a verdict of battery as a lesser included offense. State v. Messa, 594 A.2d 882, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 215 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Crime of Violence.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court did not abuse its discretion where it terminated defense counsel’s questioning of thirteen-year-old victim to determine her qualifications to testify, since her answers had already established her qualifications. State v. Mandarelli, 105 R.I. 696, 254 A.2d 738, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 879 (1969).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State v. Pignolet, 465 A.2d 176 (R.I. 1983), involving evidence of a defendant’s sexual conduct with a child not named in the indictment, is limited to situations in which the testimony of siblings of tender years is both necessary in order for the state to meet its burden of proof and relevant, material, and highly probative of the accused’s lecherous conduct toward the victims over whom the defendant exercised discipline, control, and supervision. State v. Bernier, 491 A.2d 1000, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 495 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence of a defendant’s prior sexual assault on a child not known by the victims of the alleged offenses is relevant, where the theory of defense is that the victims have fabricated the evidence against the defendant and have colluded in planning their testimony. State v. Messa, 542 A.2d 1071, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 61 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Testimony regarding the defendant’s harassment of the victim is relevant, material, and reasonably necessary to prove his consciousness of guilt, where the defendant’s harassment is well documented and his threats are corroborated by the victim’s neighbor. State v. Woodson, 551 A.2d 1187, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 153 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is sufficient evidence of force to warrant submitting second degree sexual assault charges to the jury, where defendant, a schoolteacher, touched and grabbed a student unexpectedly on three occasions and there is ample proof that the student did not consent to the touchings. State v. Goodreau, 560 A.2d 318, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 96 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A defendant who ordered his stepdaughter to lie on a bed, felt her upper body, including her breasts, and felt and opened her vagina, touched her for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault within the meaning of this section.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the alleged sexual assault of a “special needs” student by a teacher took place in front of other students and a teaching assistant, their testimony was not required to find probable cause in lieu of the credible complaint of the victim and thus the teacher’s 4th and 5th Amendment 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims failed as a matter of law because the actions of the police department in arresting the teacher on second degree assault charges under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-4, did not “shock the conscience.” Forest v. Pawtucket Police Dep't, 290 F. Supp. 2d 215, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18838 (D.R.I. 2003), aff'd, 377 F.3d 52, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 15527 (1st Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied defendant’s new trial motion, as the evidence was legally sufficient to support his convictions for first-degree and second-degree sexual assault, as well as simple assault, as the trial justice acted within his province in choosing to find the victims’ testimony more credible than that of defendant. State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 24 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It could not be concluded that the trial justice in this close and credibility-intensive sexual assault case was either clearly wrong or that he overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence in his denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial; accordingly, the trial justice properly denied defendant’s motion. State v. Barrios, 88 A.3d 1123, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 43 (R.I. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence of defendant’s conduct relating to a shower incident provided the basis for a conviction on only one charge of second-degree sexual assault, and an additional conviction was vacated; defendant’s convictions for six counts of first-degree sexual assault and two counts of second-degree sexual assault, relating to conduct involving his daughter, were upheld. State v. Perez, 161 A.3d 487, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 77 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a sexual assault case, the trial justice properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial because there was no indication that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence; although defendant contended that the jury’s acquittal on the counts of first-degree sexual assault and assault with intent to commit first-degree sexual assault established that the jury discounted the victim’s version of events, the trial justice found that the victim’s overall appearance, testimony, and recollection of the events were credible and worthy of belief in relation to the five counts of second-degree sexual assault defendant was convicted of. State v. Rogers, 207 A.3d 457, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 70 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Force or Coercion.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Incidents where defendant psychiatrist placed his arms around plaintiff and pressed his genital area against her did not involve assault using “force or coercion” within the meaning of subdivision (2) or a “crime of violence” within the meaning of the Violence Against Women Act, 42 U.S.C. § 13981. Palazzolo v. Ruggiano, 993 F. Supp. 45, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2062 (D.R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The evidence was sufficient to establish the offense charged where it clearly showed that the victim believed that the defendant would carry out his threats to harm him if he did not do as he was told. In re David G., 741 A.2d 863, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 212 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>With regard to defendant’s conviction for sexual assault wherein a trial justice found that all of the ingredients were present and his conclusion that all of the relevant hallmarks of force or coercion, both physical and psychological, were part of defendant’s misconduct, the appellate court vacated the conviction and remanded the case for the trial justice to conduct an independent examination of the evidence to determine whether the State had established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was guilty of the charged crimes based solely on physical force. Because the trial justice erroneously found force and coercion by implied threats, the appellate court was uncertain about whether defendant was convicted based on a finding of force and coercion by physical force beyond a reasonable doubt which was separate and apart from the error. State v. DiPetrillo, 922 A.2d 124, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 54 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Indictment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant’s motion for a bill of particulars because the State provided defendant with adequate notice that it intended to proceed under both theories that the victim was physically helpless and that defendant used force or coercion when he assaulted her; and the State was not under a duty to elect, prior to trial, which theory it would pursue. State v. Gregson, 113 A.3d 393, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 57 (R.I. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Instructions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Jury instruction that was given in defendant’s case was not erroneous because, pursuant to established jurisprudence, there was no proper basis to apply the rule announced in a later case regarding the element of force and coercion to the final judgment in defendant’s case as the later ruling did not alter or shift the burden of proof or plow any new ground. Pierce v. Wall, 941 A.2d 189, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 14 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Sexual Contact.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice committed reversible error in refusing to instruct the jurors that they were required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant’s contact with his niece was for the purpose of his sexual arousal, gratification, or assault, in order to convict under the second-degree sexual-assault statutes, i.e., this section and § 11-37-1. State v. Tobin, 602 A.2d 528, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 13 (R.I. 1992).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because statutory rape can encompass both violent and non-violent conduct, it was permissible for a district court to examine the indictment to learn of the circumstances of the crime, but it was error for the court to delve into the facts of the crime in order to determine whether his conviction was for a violent or non-violent crime. United States v. Sacko, 178 F.3d 1, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 18749 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because of the risk, seriousness and likelihood of injury and disease resulting from the defendant’s criminal actions, there was no error in the conclusion of the sentencing court that he had been convicted of a violent felony and that he should be sentenced as an “armed career criminal” under the federal statute governing such offenders. United States v. Sacko, 103 F. Supp. 2d 85, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9110 (D.R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For purposes of federal “armed career criminal” laws the analysis of what constitutes a “violent felony” does not turn on state law, since a state’s classification of a crime generally reflects different policy considerations than the federal classification. United States v. Sacko, 247 F.3d 21, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 7595 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a victim is unable to consent, the proscribed conduct inherently involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used in the course of committing the offense; therefore, an immigrant was subject to deportation under 8 U.S.C.S. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) because the offense of third degree sexual assault under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-6 was a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C.S. § 16 since it involved a substantial risk of physical force due to the presumed higher age and experience of the perpetrator. Aguiar v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 86, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 3659 (1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1213, 127 S. Ct. 1251, 167 L. Ed. 2d 87, 2007 U.S. LEXIS 2183 (2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Effect of Amendments to Crime Against Nature Statute.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice did not err in determining that the preservation of abominable and detestable crime against nature charges against the defendant would have been inconsistent with the manifest intention of the legislature to decriminalize sodomy between consenting adults and that such preservation would be repugnant to the statute as amended. State v. Mullen, 740 A.2d 783, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 195 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Motion for New Trial.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial in her first-degree child molestation and third-degree sexual assault case because, inter alia, the trial court clearly articulated sound reasons for denying the motion, noted that the prosecution had presented four witnesses, summarized the testimony, and dismissed defendant’s contention that if the events actually occurred, the victim would have reported it to his father, noting that their father-son relationship was not such that such disclosure likely would occur; the trial court explained that it was impressed with the manner by which the victim testified and had no concern or suspicion surrounding any of the witnesses. The trial court believed that the jury could have concluded that defendant’s remarks about the paternity of her son were an admission of having engaged in sexual relationships with the victim. State v. Barry, 982 A.2d 1050, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 126 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Other Acts Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the victim’s testimony that defendant sexually assaulted her over 100 times over the course of three years because the testimony was highly probative of defendant’s lewd disposition toward the victim and was indicative of a common opportunity, intent, and plan with the offense for which defendant was being tried, child molestation.

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the Rhode Island Supreme Court received more than 40 nearly identical petitions for writ of certiorari seeking review of the superior court’s denial of the respective petitioner’s postconviction relief application, all the petitions for writ of certiorari were denied as the statutes for murder, first-degree sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, third-degree sexual assault, first-degree child molestation sexual assault, and second-degree child molestation sexual assault were not unconstitutional for setting out the prohibited conduct in one section of a chapter in Rhode Island’s General Laws, and setting out the penalty in the subsequent section because that arrangement did not somehow render those statutes without legal force and effect. In re Writ of Certiorari Seeking Review of Denials of Applications, 219 A.3d 320, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 124 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Age of Victim.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>With respect to the age requirement, first degree child molestation sexual assault is a strict liability offense and a defendant charged with the offense may not introduce evidence that he was mistaken about the victim’s age. State v. Yanez, 716 A.2d 759, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 273 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Implied Mens Rea.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The first-degree child-molestation sexual-assault statute, like its second-degree sexual-assault counterpart, has an implied mens rea requirement requiring that the state must prove that a defendant must act with the intent of sexual arousal or gratification in order to be found guilty of the offense. It is true that the Legislature can enact strict liability statutes devoid of any mens rea; however, first-degree child-molestation sexual assault, which carries a minimum twenty-year sentence, is not a strict liability offense. Therefore, since the trial court failed to give an instruction requiring the jury to find that the defendant’s act of penetration was for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification, the defendant’s conviction must be vacated and the case must be remanded for a new trial. State v. Griffith, 660 A.2d 704, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 170 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The <i>Griffith </i>doctrine, which holds that a trial court’s failure to charge a jury in a prosecution under this section that the defendant’s act was for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification is error, is not applicable to purposeful penile penetration (as opposed to digital penetration), which as a matter of law precludes innocent touching. In re Odell, 672 A.2d 457, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 110 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the terms of this section the state need not offer proof that the act was committed against the wishes of the victim. The state is required merely to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the defendant in fact engaged in the sexual penetration of the victim and (2) the victim was 13 (now 14) years of age or under. State v. Collins, 543 A.2d 641, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 1988), overruled, State v. Rios, 702 A.2d 889, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 295 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Consensual Sexual Activity.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Consensual sexual activity with a person who has passed the thirteenth (now fourteenth) anniversary of his or her birth does not constitute the offense of first degree child molestation sexual assault. State v. Jordan, 528 A.2d 731, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 535 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is inapplicable to victims after the thirteenth (now fourteenth) anniversary of birth. State v. Collins, 543 A.2d 641, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 1988), overruled, State v. Rios, 702 A.2d 889, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 295 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Duplicity.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was not duplicitous; the allegations for count one specifed one incident of child molestation, and the bill of particulars narrowed that incident to “the first time” penetration occurred. The victim testified about the first incident and her testimony about the more than 100 acts of uncharged conduct was vague and simply acknowledged that “the same thing happened every time.” State v. Thibedau, 157 A.3d 1063, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 44 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Elements of Crime.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There are two essential elements to first degree child molestation sexual assault. First, the defendant must engage in sexual penetration of the victim. Second, the victim is age 13 (now 14) or younger. State v. Girouard, 561 A.2d 882, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 137 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The victim’s testimony that she was unable to recall dates of sexual abuse because they “blurred together” went directly to the question of whether intercourse had occurred prior to the victim’s fourteenth birthday. Thus, the dates were crucial to the determination of defendant’s guilt or innocence and the trial judge should have reread all of the victim’s direct and cross-examination testimony about the timing rather than merely portions which the judge deemed relevant. State v. Pierce, 689 A.2d 1030, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 11 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A minor witness’ testimony about her sister’s biting the defendant’s penis, causing him to say “ow” in response, was consistent with and highly probative of the fact that the defendant inserted his penis into the mouth of the child. In re Ryan B., 739 A.2d 232, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 188 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>District court committed plain error when it characterized defendant as a Tier III sex offender and when it then utilized that designation in its guidelines calculation with regard to his conviction for child molestation under Rhode Island law because R.I. Gen. Laws. § 11-37-8.1 was not comparable to the federal offenses listed in Tier III of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, 42 U.S.C.S. § 16911(4). United States v. Morales, 801 F.3d 1, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 15140 (1st Cir. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court was well within its discretion to deny defendant’s motion for new trial; although the victim’s testimony did contain disparities, the disparities reflected no more than minor details. The daughter’s inconsistent statements regarding defendant’s ejaculation did not concern a detail “integral to the sexual assault itself”, because ejaculation is not required for a conviction of first-degree child molestation. State v. Rainey, 175 A.3d 1169, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 5 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Testimony by the victim of a first degree sexual assault of describing sexual acts committed by the defendant commencing some seven years before the acts with which the defendant was charged, clearly fit the exception to the rule regarding proof of uncharged sexual misconduct to show “lustful disposition or sexual propensity” pertinent to proof of prior incestuous relations; therefore, admission of the testimony was not error. State v. Toole, 640 A.2d 965, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 134 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution under this section, it was error to preclude the defendant from informing the jury that the victim was five months pregnant at the time of the trial, as it was highly relevant that at the time she testified concerning incidents of sexual abuse, she had a source of sexual knowledge, independent of any of these acts, from which she could have learned the details of the sexual acts that she described. State v. Haslam, 663 A.2d 902, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 211 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Testimony that the defendant and his daughter shared the same bed was not evidence of “other crimes” under Rule 404(b), R.I. Rules of Evidence. Rather, the testimony provided a good description of the defendant’s relationship with the minor child and the trial court correctly admitted such evidence, which was wholly relevant to the charge of first-degree child molestation. State v. Yelland, 676 A.2d 1335, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 158 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Testimony by the victim about uncharged acts that were committed against her by the defendant was held admissible. State v. Gomes, 690 A.2d 310, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 46 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mere fact that a minor victim closed her lips, made a pouting motion, and exhaled during her demonstration on the stand did not necessarily indicate a lack of the requisite oral contact with the respondent’s penis for fellatio to have occurred, and the trial justice was not clearly wrong in concluding that the evidence was both legally competent and sufficient to establish the act of fellatio. In re Ryan B., 739 A.2d 232, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 188 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding, on relevance grounds, not to allow defendant to testify regarding his freedom from sexually transmitted diseases where the charges involved statutory rape, not infecting a sexual partner; defendant’s failure to make an offer of proof made it nearly impossible for the high court to second-guess the trial court. State v. Pena-Rojas, 822 A.2d 921, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 130 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a victim’s credibility was buttressed by an earlier handwritten note, as well as by the defendant’s sister, who testified about a subsequent violent reaction that the victim had when confronted with the possibility of being alone with her father, the finding of a probation violation under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-8.1 and R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-8.2 was proper. State v. Vashey, 823 A.2d 1151, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 147 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Victim’s testimony that defendant touched her genitalia with his mouth when he sucked on her private part was sufficient to constitute cunnilingus and thus, to support a conviction for first degree child molestation sexual assault. State v. Higham, 865 A.2d 1040, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 202 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction of first-degree child molestation sexual assault; the trial justice did not err in denying a motion for a new trial where despite certain weaknesses in the child victim’s identification testimony, defendant’s own testimony bolstered the identification of defendant as the molester. State v. Horton, 871 A.2d 959, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 80 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for first-degree child molestation sexual assault, the State properly asked the 11-year-old victim leading questions, as she had difficulty grasping the legal significance of penetration and she was reluctant to recount the events of her molestation. Further, as the leading questions were asked to clarify the already existing record, defendant was not substantially prejudiced. State v. Merced, 933 A.2d 172, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a child’s father caught defendant molesting the child, defendant’s first-degree child molestation conviction was upheld because: (1) the recording of the father’s 911 call was properly admitted as an excited utterance and a present sense impression; (2) the father’s statement to a police officer was properly admitted as an excited utterance; and (3) defendant’s new trial motion was properly denied. State v. Bergevine, 942 A.2d 974, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 25 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial in her first-degree child molestation and third-degree sexual assault case because, inter alia, the trial court clearly articulated sound reasons for denying the motion, noted that the prosecution had presented four witnesses, summarized the testimony, and dismissed defendant’s contention that if the events actually occurred, the victim would have reported it to his father, noting that their father-son relationship was not such that such disclosure likely would occur; the trial court explained that it was impressed with the manner by which the victim testified and had no concern or suspicion surrounding any of the witnesses. The trial court believed that the jury could have concluded that defendant’s remarks about the paternity of her son were an admission of having engaged in sexual relationships with the victim. State v. Barry, 982 A.2d 1050, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 126 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was tried for committing offenses which, if committed by an adult, would constitute first-degree child molestation sexual assault, his claim that his due process right to present a defense was violated because the charges lacked specificity as to time and place was meritless. The victim testified about the location where and the approximate time period when the events occurred; as defendant denied ever spending time alone with the victim, whether he did not do so on a specific date was irrelevant. In re Miguel A., 990 A.2d 1216, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was tried for committing offenses which, if committed by an adult, would constitute first-degree child molestation sexual assault, his psychiatrist’s proffered testimony that he had no history of inappropriate sexual behavior was properly excluded because it was irrelevant under R.I. R. Evid. 401 and would not serve to prove any pertinent character trait under R.I. R. Evid. 404(1)(a). In re Miguel A., 990 A.2d 1216, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Following defendant’s conviction for sexual molestation of his infant daughter in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 11-37-8.1, 11-37-8.2.2, 11-9-5.3(b)(1), 11-9-5.3(c)(2) and 11-9-5.3(f), the trial justice articulated sufficient reasoning for agreeing with the jury and denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, based in part on defendant’s confession, which described in detail how he had inflicted the various injuries to his daughter, demonstrating personal knowledge and not speculation. State v. Baptista, 79 A.3d 24, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 146 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was not error to refuse to pass defendant’s first-degree child molestation sexual assault prosecution, because (1) after a statement of the consistency of the victim’s disclosure with sexual abuse was stricken from an expert’s testimony, the jury could decide the probative value of the rest of the testimony, and (2) under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-11, no corroboration of the victim’s testimony was required. State v. Rathbun, 184 A.3d 211, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 51 (R.I. 2018).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution under this section, although an expert witness’ testimony that she had been counseling the victim for “sex abuse recovery” was not a literal statement of her belief in the victim’s truthfulness, it had the same substantive impact and would have been perceived by the jury as a conclusive opinion that the victim had testified truthfully. Because the victim was the complaining witness, her credibility was a crucial issue and the expert witness’ testimony, therefore, constituted impermissible vouching for the credibility of the victim. State v. Haslam, 663 A.2d 902, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 211 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution under this section, the testimony of a pediatrician who examined the victim that the victim had “probably” been rectally penetrated should not have been admitted, as the witness had relied to a greater extent upon the history related by the victim in reaching her conclusion than she had relied upon the results of the physical examination she administered. Because the witness’ opinion was based on evidence that was not within the realm of her medical capabilities or expertise, it amounted to nothing more than her assessment of the credibility of the victim’s testimony. State v. Haslam, 663 A.2d 902, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 211 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a first-degree child molestation sexual assault prosecution, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the remainder of an expert’s testimony after the trial court struck the expert’s statement regarding the consistency of the victim’s disclosure with sexual abuse and cautioned the jury to disregard the statement. State v. Rathbun, 184 A.3d 211, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 51 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Insufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state did not prove a violation of this section since the evidence showed that at the suggestion of defendant the child inserted her own finger into her vaginal area. State v. Bryant, 670 A.2d 776, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 24 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The evidence was more than sufficient for a jury to convict the defendant of second-degree molestation while acquitting him on first-degree molestation charges, since the victim provided vivid descriptions of the acts constituting second-degree molestation but could not remember specific events relating to the first-degree molestation counts. State v. Allessio, 762 A.2d 1190, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 210 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was insufficient to sustain the family court’s adjudications of delinquency on two charges of first-degree child molestation. The testimony of the two victims that their penises were “in” and “inside” defendant minor’s “butt” was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that sexual penetration of defendant’s anal opening occurred. In re B.H., 138 A.3d 774, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Lesser Included Offenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a trial for child molestation, the trial court correctly declined to give an instruction on the lesser included offense of simple assault and battery because the evidence did not invite such a charge. State v. Haigh, 666 A.2d 803, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 247 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Each count of the petition charging defendant minor with first-degree child molestation necessarily included a charge on the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation. There was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the contact between defendant and his victims could be reasonably construed as intended by defendant to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault. In re B.H., 138 A.3d 774, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Other Acts.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for child molestation, instructing the jury that evidence of the defendant’s criminal acts with persons other than the victim was to be received “solely on the issue of credibility” was tantamount to saying that the jury could receive and apply such evidence on the issue of guilt or innocence. Relying on this instruction, the jury could have found the defendant guilty if it believed that he had engaged in anal intercourse with his wife, a crime under § 11-10-1. The instruction, therefore, was both erroneous and highly prejudicial. State v. Haslam, 663 A.2d 902, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 211 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in admitting evidence of defendant’s touching a child victim’s sister because the evidence was non-remote and sufficiently similar to the charged offenses, was relevant to show defendant’s specific intent to sexually gratify, was reasonably necessary to support the victim’s credibility, and defendant waived the adequacy of the trial court’s cautionary instruction by not raising an objection prior to the jury’s deliberations. State v. Mitchell, 80 A.3d 19, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 153 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the victim’s testimony that defendant sexually assaulted her over 100 times over the course of three years because the testimony was highly probative of defendant’s lewd disposition towards the victim and was indicative of a common opportunity, intent, and plan with the offense for which defendant was being tried, child molestation. State v. Thibedau, 157 A.3d 1063, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 44 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Sufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not abuse her discretion in denying defendant’s motion for new trial, because the trial justice assessed the complainant’s credibility and found the complainant to be a witness worthy of belief, found that defendant offered no compelling reason for overturning the trial justice’s credibility determination, and the trial justice agreed with the jury’s finding and clearly articulated a reason for doing so. State v. Guerrero, 996 A.2d 86, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 69 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not err in failing to grant defendant’s motion for a new trial on the charges of first-degree sexual assault, where the trial justice thoroughly reviewed and summarized the testimony of all witnesses while also noting that there were some inconsistencies, and it was clear from the trial justice’s bench ruling that the trial justice concluded that reasonable minds could differ but was satisfied that the complainant and her sister were believable and credible. State v. Rosario, 35 A.3d 938, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 10 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for first- and second-degree child molestation, the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial, as it independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, explicitly found that the complaining witness was credible and honest, and then determined that it would have reached the same result as the jury. State v. Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 153 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial after he was convicted of multiple counts of first- and second-degree child molestation, because its determination that the testimony of the victim and other State witnesses was credible while defendant’s testimony was not was entitled to deference and was not clearly wrong. State v. Lapierre, 57 A.3d 305, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 159 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not entitled to a new trial as to convictions for first-degree child molestation and second-degree child molestation because (1) the victim’s testimony was found sufficient, without corroborating testimony and defendant’s confession, to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt, (2) the prosecutor was admonished for comments about defendant looking at counsel while testifying, and (3) defendant’s limiting instruction on the issue was given. State v. Buchanan, 81 A.3d 1119, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 5 (R.I. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice conducted the proper three-step analysis in passing on defendant’s motion for a new trial and properly denied it, in connection with defendant’s conviction of first and second-degree child molestation; the minor victim’s younger brother’s testimony corroborated the victim’s testimony, the trial justice concluded that there was no way they fabricated the accusations, and defendant’s various arguments essentially amounted to nothing more than a disagreement with the trial justice’s assessment of witness credibility and the weight of the evidence. State v. Muralles, 154 A.3d 925, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 27 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal because the victim’s clarification was “precise” and “specific” as to vaginal penetration, and, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, it was adequate to prove penetration beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Rainey, 175 A.3d 1169, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 5 (R.I. 2018).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Indictment.</b></p>

Furthermore, defense counsel was afforded considerable latitude on cross-examination to explore with the complaining witness dates, times, locations, and circumstances regarding the different and disparate instances that were alleged in the indictment. Pierce v. Wall, 941 A.2d 189, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 14 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Multiple Offenses.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though the state lacks authority to charge child sexual assault as a continuing course of conduct crime, this will not impede the conviction, upon a properly constituted indictment or bill of particulars, of a defendant who has repeatedly sexually abused a child; it is only necessary that each count should charge a single offense.

<p class="p7"><b>Calculation of Sentence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Length of a probationer’s sentence was not miscalculated because the probationer’s credits for good conduct and participation in institutional industries, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-24, and for time served awaiting disposition, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-19-2(a), did not entitle the probationer to an acceleration of the end date of the probationer’s probationary term. Rose v. State, 92 A.3d 903, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 20 (R.I. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Correction Not Required.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Discrepancy between a judgment of conviction and a sentencing transcript did not require correction of defendant’s sentence for first-degree child molestation sexual assault under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 as: (1) defense counsel admitted twice that sentence for first-degree child molestation sexual assault was 50 years’ concurrent; (2) a five-year sentence would have been illegal under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-8.2; and (3) the trial justice stated during sentencing that the convictions were just as egregious as the first first-degree child molestation sexual assault count, for which defendant was sentenced to life in prison.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the trial justice thoughtfully considered defendant’s past, because the sentence imposed was below the maximum penalty under R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was no abuse of discretion in sentencing the defendant to a total of 45 years for 10 separate offenses of sexual assault, since his sentences would have totaled 96 years had the minimum sentences called for and required to be imposed by the relevant statutes been imposed consecutively.

<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence showing that defendant removed the victim’s clothes, exposed his penis and with it made contact with the child’s vaginal area was sufficient to sustain his conviction, notwithstanding his contention that the sole purpose of any contact he might have had with the victim was to set up a sexual assault charge against his landlord with the aid of false testimony from the victim. State v. Rossi, 520 A.2d 582, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 406 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence of a defendant’s prior sexual assault on a child not known by the victims of the alleged offenses is relevant, where the theory of defense is that the victims have fabricated the evidence against defendant and have colluded in planning their testimony.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction, where the victim testified that defendant touched her private parts and put his penis between her legs, the victim’s testimony was corroborated by testimony given by her sister, and the testimony was buttressed by sexually explicit photographs of defendant and the victim. State v. Shatney, 572 A.2d 872, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 75 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal should have been granted, where the evidence presented at trial showed, at the most, an ambiguous touch from which a jury would have to speculate to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that its purpose was for sexual arousal or gratification.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The evidence was more than sufficient for a jury to convict the defendant of second-degree molestation while acquitting him on first-degree molestation charges, since the victim provided vivid descriptions of the acts constituting second-degree molestation but could not remember specific events relating to the first-degree molestation counts.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court did not err in finding defendant juvenile guilty of second-degree child molestation sexual assault. The family court’s finding that the victim was a credible witness was rationally supported by competent evidence; the victim was able to testify about three different events, and the inconsistencies in her testimony were insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt with respect to the State’s case.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the victim’s birth date clearly made the victim 14 years of age or younger at the time of the alleged offense and two witnesses credibly testified that defendant intentionally touched the victim’s naked buttocks with his penis, contact that could reasonably be construed as intended to be for the purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. State v. Erminelli, 991 A.2d 1064, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 68 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court committed clear error by admitting highly incriminating evidence pursuant to the “lewd disposition” exception in R.I. R. Evid. 404(b) during defendant’s trial for second-degree child molestation sexual assault, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-9.3, because the State violated R.I. Super Ct. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(8) by not turning the evidence over until the second day of trial; the supplemental answer to discovery presented to defendant on the second day of trial indicated the State intended to produce evidence of alleged sexual contact in a shower between defendant and the victim, defendant’s teenage daughter, despite the original information package containing no mention of any alleged contact. State v. Langstaff, 994 A.2d 1216, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 58 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not abuse her discretion in denying defendant’s motion for new trial, because the trial justice assessed the complainant’s credibility and found the complainant to be a witness worthy of belief, found that defendant offered no compelling reason for overturning the trial justice’s credibility determination, and the trial justice agreed with the jury’s finding and clearly articulated a reason for doing so.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where evidence from other accusers was admitted at a prisoner’s child molestation trial, the prisoner’s federal habeas petition was properly denied because the prisoner failed to exhaust the claim that the admission of prior bad acts evidence violated the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and the claim failed on the merits since the state court’s approval of the introduction of the prior bad acts evidence was well within the universe of plausible evidentiary rulings. Coningford v. Rhode Island, 640 F.3d 478, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 10159 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 565 U.S. 954, 132 S. Ct. 426, 181 L. Ed. 2d 277, 2011 U.S. LEXIS 7274 (2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In view of a child’s multiple identifications of defendant as the man who had entered her bedroom and touched her vagina, his fingerprints being found on package of gum she said he left in her room, and his admissions that he was familiar with the location of her home and that he had purchased the same brand of gum, the evidence was sufficient to establish that he violated his probation. State v. Jensen, 40 A.3d 771, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 40 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for first- and second-degree child molestation, the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial, as it independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, explicitly found that the complaining witness was credible and honest, and then determined that it would have reached the same result as the jury. State v. Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 153 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial after he was convicted of multiple counts of first- and second-degree child molestation, because its determination that the testimony of the victim and other State witnesses was credible while defendant’s testimony was not was entitled to deference and was not clearly wrong. State v. Lapierre, 57 A.3d 305, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 159 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in admitting evidence of defendant’s touching a child victim’s sister because the evidence was non-remote and sufficiently similar to the charged offenses, was relevant to show defendant’s specific intent to sexually gratify, was reasonably necessary to support the victim’s credibility, and defendant waived the adequacy of the trial court’s cautionary instruction by not raising an objection prior to the jury’s deliberations. State v. Mitchell, 80 A.3d 19, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 153 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not entitled to a new trial as to convictions for first-degree child molestation and second-degree child molestation because (1) the victim’s testimony was found sufficient, without corroborating testimony and defendant’s confession, to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt, (2) the prosecutor was admonished for comments about defendant looking at counsel while testifying, and (3) defendant’s limiting instruction on the issue was given. State v. Buchanan, 81 A.3d 1119, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 5 (R.I. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err by denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction of second-degree child molestation where the six-year-old victim testified that on the night of the incident she woke up, felt something on her vagina, and saw defendant standing at her bed. Her mother’s testimony corroborated the victim’s statements and defendant told a detective that he touched the victim’s vagina. State v. Armour, 110 A.3d 1195, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 37 (R.I. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Juvenile was properly adjudicated as a delinquent for engaging in second-degree child molestation sexual assault because the evidence showed that the juvenile entered the room where the victim was sleeping on two occasions and touched the victim on the second occasion by placing the juvenile’s fingers over the victim’s vagina and underwear for the purpose of the juvenile’s sexual gratification. In re Kyle A., 137 A.3d 706, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 52 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Each count of the petition charging defendant minor with first-degree child molestation necessarily included a charge on the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation. There was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the contact between defendant and his victims could be reasonably construed as intended by defendant to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault. In re B.H., 138 A.3d 774, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice conducted the proper three-step analysis in passing on defendant’s motion for a new trial and properly denied it, in connection with defendant’s conviction of first and second-degree child molestation; the minor victim’s younger brother’s testimony corroborated the victim’s testimony, the trial justice concluded that there was no way they fabricated the accusations, and defendant’s various arguments essentially amounted to nothing more than a disagreement with the trial justice’s assessment of witness credibility and the weight of the evidence. State v. Muralles, 154 A.3d 925, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 27 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the minor victim did not explicitly offer testimony that defendant’s hand touched her vagina in describing every occasion of sexual assault, the victim’s testimony on certain counts sufficiently referred back to an earlier assault in that defendant was “doing the same thing as the other times” and created a nexus between her testimony and the body part delineated in the statute, her genital area. State v. Cavanaugh, 158 A.3d 268, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 48 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a case in which defendant was convicted of one count of first-degree sexual assault and three counts of second-degree child molestation, defendant’s motion for a new trial was properly denied because the trial justice stated that reasonable minds could differ as to what the verdict should be; the trial justice did not overlook the evidence of the victim’s potential motive for testifying as she did or the evidence that her poor relationship with defendant started only after he allegedly violated her confidence; and the trial justice did not overlook the lack of independent evidence as there was no requirement of independent corroboration for sex offense cases. State v. Acosta, 247 A.3d 489, 2021 R.I. LEXIS 24 (R.I. 2021).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Other Acts.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the victim’s testimony that defendant sexually assaulted her over 100 times over the course of three years because the testimony was highly probative of defendant’s lewd disposition toward the victim and was indicative of a common opportunity, intent, and plan with the offense for which defendant was being tried, child molestation. State v. Thibedau, 157 A.3d 1063, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 44 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Guilty Plea.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even if a post-conviction relief applicant had shown improper advice by his attorney at his plea to child molestation, he failed to show that prejudice resulted from the advice becuase, pursuant to R.I. Gen.

Perkins v. State, 78 A.3d 764, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 137 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jury Instructions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notwithstanding initial misstatements, that had to be corrected after bench conferences, a trial justice’s explanation of the elements of child molestation sufficiently clarified that any touching had to be for purposes of sexual arousal; furthermore, the justice’s explanation of burden of proof was unequivocal and correct. State v. Ibrahim, 862 A.2d 787, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 203 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Multiple Offenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though the state lacks authority to charge child sexual assault as a continuing course of conduct crime, this will not impede the conviction, upon a properly constituted indictment or bill of particulars, of a defendant who has repeatedly sexually abused a child; it is only necessary that each count should charge a single offense. State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 233 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not entitled to a new trial after the jury found him guilty on two out of fourteen counts of child molestation because the trial court: (1) addressed with specificity the multiple incidents of alleged sexual assault; (2) found the victim, her mother, and her sister to be credible witnesses; and (3) concluded the inconsistent verdicts could have resulted from jury compromise. State v. Hie, 93 A.3d 963, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>New Trial.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Nolo Contendere Plea.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Denial of an inmate’s postconviction relief petition was proper because the inmate’s Alford plea to second-degree child molestation was voluntary, intelligent, and knowing for R.I.

<p class="p7"><b>Reduction of Sentence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court did not improperly consider in a motion to reduce sentence the defendant’s exercise of his right to stand trial or his corollary right to hold the state to its burden of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt through the presentation of testimony from the child victim, since the defendant forced the child to testify about the molestation in open court by exercising his right to stand trial and by presenting false testimony to the court in the hopes of escaping conviction and punishment, and had indicated his intention to appeal while knowing full well that what the little girl said from the stand was absolutely true.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the trial justice thoughtfully considered defendant’s past, because the sentence imposed was below the maximum penalty under R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was no abuse of discretion in sentencing the defendant to a total of 45 years for 10 separate offenses of sexual assault, since his sentences would have totaled 96 years had the minimum sentences called for and required to be imposed by the relevant statutes been imposed consecutively.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s appeal from the denial of his R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because defendant’s sentence for second-degree child molestation was clearly within the limits of R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the testimony of defendant’s victim was presented by videotape, the trial court’s findings that the victim unequivocally would suffer unreasonable and unnecessary mental and emotional harm if required to testify in defendant’s presence satisfied the requirements of a United States Supreme Court decision issued subsequent to the denial of defendant’s direct appeal. Taylor v. Wall, 821 A.2d 685, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State had no basis whatsoever to point to R.I.Gen. Laws § 11-37-13.2(a), in seeking an order to close the courtroom in a child sexual assault prosecution; the statute provided for alternate means for relieving child rape victims from the trauma associated with facing their alleged abusers in a courtroom, however, closing the courtroom was not among them. The statute did not apply because the child testified at trial, not outside the courtroom, as provided for by § 11-37-13.2(a). State v. Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d 984, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 73 (R.I.), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1071, 129 S. Ct. 740, 172 L. Ed. 2d 729, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 9079 (2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-13.2(a) reflects the Legislature’s effort to establish procedures for the protection of child victims, it does not anticipate that a trial justice summarily will exclude the public from attending a trial. After all, itt is the defendant who is accused and whose right to a public trial is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.State v. Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d 984, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 73 (R.I.), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1071, 129 S. Ct. 740, 172 L. Ed. 2d 729, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 9079 (2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Mandatory Jury Instructions for Videotaped Testimony.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a trial judge allows videotaped or broadcast testimony into evidence under this section, it is mandatory that an instruction be given which informs the jury that they are not to infer that the child is afraid of the defendant or that he or she is guilty. State v. Taylor, 562 A.2d 445, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 143 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Testimony at Trial.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State’s reliance on R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-13.2, as support for its motion for the closure of the courtroomwhile a child witness testified, was misplaced. R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 11-37-13.2 and 12-28-8(c) were not to be read as allowing trial justices to bar the public from attending a criminal trial. State v. Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d 984, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 73 (R.I.), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1071, 129 S. Ct. 740, 172 L. Ed. 2d 729, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 9079 (2008).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even if they had been properly preserved, a registrant’s constitutional challenges to the registrant’s sex offender risk-level classification would fail, because the registrant was afforded a meaningful hearing and failed to demonstrate that his right to procedural due process was violated. Furthermore, the registrant’s constitutional rights to the presumption of innocence and against double jeopardy were not violated because sex-offender registration did not constitute criminal punishment. DiCarlo v. State, 212 A.3d 1191, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 106 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Registrant’s challenge to the registrant’s sex offender risk-level classification failed as the Rhode Island Sex Offender Board of Review’s decision was not based solely on underlying facts of the first-degree child molestation charges of which the registrant was acquitted. Looking at the full extent of the material the board set forth as having reviewed—including the registrant’s failure to participate in sex-offender treatment programs and denial of the underlying offense—the board considered numerous factors in making its determination. DiCarlo v. State, 212 A.3d 1191, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 106 (R.I. 2019).</p>

Gen. Laws § 11-37.1-3(a); the Registration Act is constitutional as applied to juveniles. The confidentiality generally afforded to a juvenile is not absolute; sometimes confidentiality has to give way to other legitimate societal priorities. In re Richard A., 946 A.2d 204, 2008 R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was convicted in 1994 for a 1993 child molestation sexual assault offense, and the statutes were subsequently amended in 1996, 1997, and 2003 extending the duration of a defendant’s duty to register as a sex offender and increasing the penalty for registration violations, defendant’s failure-to-notify convictions in 2007, 2009, and 2010 did not run afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. The duration of defendant’s duty to register was merely a condition attached to a civil, nonpunitive regulatory measure, not the imposition of retroactive punishment. State v. Gibson, 182 A.3d 540, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 98 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Duration of Duty to Register.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For a defendant who was convicted before the passage of § 11-37.1 et seq., language in R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37.1-18 preserves defendant’s <i>duty </i>to register as a sex offender under the former law, not its duration. The duration of the duty to register as a sex offender is governed by § 11-37.1-4. State v. Gibson, 182 A.3d 540, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 98 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was convicted in 1994 for a 1993 child molestation sexual assault offense, the current version of § 11-37.1-4 governed and therefore defendant’s duty to register as a sex offender expired 10 years from the expiration of sentence for the offense. State v. Gibson, 182 A.3d 540, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 98 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Juvenile’s Duty to Register.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice appropriately applied the plain language of this section in determining that she had no discretion and that defendant, a juvenile, was required to register as a sex offender based on the trial justice’s determination that this was not a case of willing sexual exploration between curious adolescents but there was coercion, manipulation, and an abuse of trust making the conduct criminal apart from the victims’ ages. In re B.H., 194 A.3d 260, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 110 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s statutory duty to register as a sex offender ran for 10 years from the expiration of defendant’s sentence, rather than for life; while the registration statute in place at the time of defendant’s conviction governed defendant’s duty to register, the current statute, § 11-37.1-4, controlled that duty’s duration (case remanded for further factfinding).

<p class="p7"><b>NOTES TO DECISIONS</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>Risk Assessment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court magistrate did not err when ruling that external factors warranted a deviation between the risk level indicated by the objective tests and the ultimate finding of the Sex Offender Board of Review because the Board thoroughly considered many of the Sex Offender Risk of Re-Offense Assessment Factors in combination with the validated risk assessment tools, and although the Board did make some rather conclusory findings, it nevertheless properly relied upon a range of materials to formulate its decision; the Board is entitled to utilize additional materials and documentation to conduct its risk assessment in order to adequately determine an individual’s risk to the community. State v. Dennis, 29 A.3d 445, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 125 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Language of the Sexual Offender Registration and Community Notification Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37.1-6, paired with the Sexual Offender Community Notification Guidelines, suggests that a sexual offender assessment should not take place in a vacuum or solely rest on the results of the risk assessment tools; the classification of an individual’s future risk of sexual recidivism is not a one-size-fits-all application. State v. Dennis, 29 A.3d 445, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 125 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Registrant’s challenge to the registrant’s sex offender risk-level classification failed as the Rhode Island Sex Offender Board of Review’s decision was not based solely on underlying facts of the first-degree child molestation charges of which the registrant was acquitted. Looking at the full extent of the material the board set forth as having reviewed—including the registrant’s failure to participate in sex-offender treatment programs and denial of the underlying offense—the board considered numerous factors in making its determination. DiCarlo v. State, 212 A.3d 1191, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 106 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even if they had been properly preserved, a registrant’s constitutional challenges to the registrant’s sex offender risk-level classification would fail, because the registrant was afforded a meaningful hearing and failed to demonstrate that his right to procedural due process was violated. Furthermore, the registrant’s constitutional rights to the presumption of innocence and against double jeopardy were not violated because sex-offender registration did not constitute criminal punishment. DiCarlo v. State, 212 A.3d 1191, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 106 (R.I. 2019).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37.1-15(a)(2) could be considered unconstitutional in some circumstances, insofar as it granted the Superior Court discretion to deny a sexual offender the right to a meaningful hearing as a part of judicial review of any risk level classification, there was no constitutional violation in the instant action, because defendant was granted a meaningful hearing. State v. Germane, 971 A.2d 555, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 68 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37.1-15(a)(2), as applied to defendant’s case, did not violate defendant’s right to substantive due process, because the Sex Offender Board of Review did, at a basic level, consider all the factors required by the guidelines in assessing appellant’s risk of re-offense. State v. Germane, 971 A.2d 555, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 68 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37.1-15 did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws, because the sex offender registration process was a civil regulatory process. State v. Germane, 971 A.2d 555, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 68 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the question of whether or not the risk of reoffense of an individual sex offender was left open to judicial determination on the basis of the proof offered by the alleged offender and/or the state, the legislatively mandated presumption was not permissibly “conclusive,” but was rebuttable, and R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37.1-15 did not violate the separation of powers clause. State v. Germane, 971 A.2d 555, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 68 (R.I. 2009).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was afforded a meaningful hearing to review his classification as a Level III, high risk sexual offender under the Sexual Offender Registration and Community Notification Act, and he failed to show that his right to procedural due process was violated because the superior court magistrate considered all written memoranda and exhibits submitted prior to the hearing, and both attorneys were granted the opportunity to develop their arguments and present further evidence at the hearing; defendant agreed to proceed on the basis of written memoranda and oral argument, and his attorney raised no objection to the scope of the hearing, nor did she inform the magistrate that she intended to call any witnesses to the stand.

<p class="p7"><b>Common Law Definition.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “robbery” when used in statutes has a technical meaning which incorporates all the elements of the common law crime. State v. Domanski, 57 R.I. 500, 190 A. 854, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 128 (1937); State v. Robalewski, 418 A.2d 817, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1717 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although robbery is a statutory offense in Rhode Island, the statute merely incorporates the common law elements of the offense. State v. Innis, 433 A.2d 646, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1238 (R.I. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 930, 102 S. Ct. 1980, 72 L. Ed. 2d 447, 1982 U.S. LEXIS 1754 (1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the statute establishing the penalties for robbery fails to set forth the elements of the crime, the common law definition of “the felonious taking of money or goods of any value from the person of another, or in his presence, against his will, by violence, or putting him in fear,” is applicable. State v. Rodriquez, 731 A.2d 726, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 141 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the statute does not define robbery, it has been held to incorporate the common-law definition. State v. Robertson, 740 A.2d 330, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 182 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a first-degree robbery case, the trial court’s instruction defining “permanent deprivation of property” to include deprivation for an unreasonable length of time, or the intent to use the property in such a way that the owner would probably be deprived of it, was proper because it was consistent with the definitions of felonious intent to steal used by other common-law jurisdictions. State v. McWilliams, 47 A.3d 251, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 111 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Double Jeopardy.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Dual convictions for carrying a dangerous weapon when committing a crime of violence and first-degree robbery did not constitute a double jeopardy violation because each offense included an additional element of proof that was not contained in the other; the jury could have returned a verdict of guilty on the robbery charge based on either defendant’s use of a dangerous weapon or the injury inflicted upon the victim, while the conviction for committing a crime of violence while armed or having available a firearm did not require that the weapon be used or that there be an injury to the victim. State v. Stone, 924 A.2d 773, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 77 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the defendant was the getaway driver and the lookout person, the trial justice was correct in finding evidence of asportation to support the robbery charge, and that evidence supported the conviction of robbery. State v. Firby, 636 A.2d 1330, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 54 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The admission into evidence of a photograph of the victim grimacing in pain was not prejudical error, since it was introduced to prove that the victim was injured during the robbery, a requirement under this section. In light of the extensive injuries sustained by the victim, it was unlikely that his facial expression evoked the jurors’ passions and resulted in undue prejudice to the defendant. State v. Beauchamp, 671 A.2d 1238, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 52 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that $100 bill was found in the area where the struggle between defendant and the victim occurred, in the vicinity of other material belonging to defendant, including defendant’s backpack, was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for first-degree robbery because it permitted the jury to infer that defendant took the money defendant had previously given the victim, a cab driver, after defendant shot the victim. State v. Stone, 924 A.2d 773, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 77 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because defendant participated in a coordinated attack on a defenseless man that began with an ambush of the victim’s vehicle and ended with a robbery and severe beating, based on the totality of the evidence, the jury reasonably could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant entered into an agreement with others to commit the crime of robbery. State v. Perkins, 966 A.2d 1257, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 33 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an armed robbery case, as a detective did not give his opinion on the ability of another witness to describe defendant accurately, but was asked to compare independently the physical description given in dispatches with defendant’s actual appearance, a task that was common to his responsibilities as a police officer, his testimony was not impermissible bolstering; therefore, the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. State v. Wray, 38 A.3d 1102, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 25 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant argued that the victims’ identifications of him at trial as the man who robbed them at gunpoint were unreliable and not substantial enough to prove his guilt, as the trial court reviewed all the testimony, including cross-examination designed to weaken the credibility of the victims’ identifications, and agreed with the jury that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, its decision to deny his motion for a new trial was deferred to on appeal. State v. Wray, 38 A.3d 1102, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 25 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly convicted defendant of second-degree robbery and denied his motion for a new trial because an eyewitness testified that he got a good look at defendant when he stopped at a driveway where defendant was standing under a light, identified defendant within one or two days when the photo array was shown to him, and made an unequivocal in-court identification of defendant. State v. Pittman, 160 A.3d 1015, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 75 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Juvenile was properly adjudicated delinquent for first-degree robbery because (1) the State produced sufficient evidence of the crime’s corpus delicti to permit admission of the juvenile’s confession, and (2) other circumstantial evidence also demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the juvenile perpetrated the crime. In re Joseph C., 178 A.3d 288, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 16 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the victim did not identify defendant in an initial photo array, her identification of defendant was sufficient because a Facebook search by her of a name provided by the Attorney General’s office yielded profiles and photos that she scrolled through before seeing one with a familiar face that was defendant. Moreover, at trial, the victim emphasized that her in-court identification of defendant was based on his height, how big he was, and his eyes. State v. Johnson, 199 A.3d 1046, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 17 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Victim’s testimony as to the actions and statements of defendant and his accomplices led to a reasonable inference that the gun used in a robbery was operable; the victim testified that she was in fear—as demonstrated by her question to an accomplice about whether he thought the others involved in the robbery were going to kill her, defendant threatened to return if she called the police, and the gun was pointed at her for the duration of the incident. State v. Johnson, 199 A.3d 1046, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 17 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Force.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the risk of bodily injury that underlies the more severe treatment of robbery is present when the item that is being snatched is attached to the body or clothing of the victim, the snatching of two chains from the neck of the victim constituted sufficient force to satisfy the denial of defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal. State v. Robertson, 740 A.2d 330, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 182 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal was properly denied as sufficient evidence of force supported defendant’s robbery conviction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-39-1(a) since the physical evidence of two cut purse straps with slice marks and a knife suggested that when defendant took her purse from the victim, she was aware of the taking and resisted it, or that the purse was so attached to her as to afford resistance. State v. Rolon, 45 A.3d 518, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 84 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Larceny and Robbery Distinguished.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The taking of goods of value from an unconscious person is larceny, not robbery, but when death or a comatose state is caused in order to facilitate the taking it is robbery. State v. Innis, 433 A.2d 646, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1238 (R.I. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 930, 102 S. Ct. 1980, 72 L. Ed. 2d 447, 1982 U.S. LEXIS 1754 (1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Lesser Included Offense.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since convictions for the offenses of robbery and compounding a felony required proof of elements quite distinct from each other, the latter was not a lesser included offense of the former. State v. Rodriquez, 731 A.2d 726, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 141 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sentence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sentence of 45 years with 15 suspended was not cruel or unusual punishment, or disproportionate to those received by other defendants similarly situated. State v. Ouimette, 479 A.2d 702, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 532 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Specific Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A specific intent to steal is an essential element of the crime of robbery, and once the defendant satisfied the burden of going forward with sufficient evidence to justify the existence of doubt on the issue of whether his intoxication was such as to negate his specific intent, it became the state’s burden to establish that he was not so intoxicated by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. McGehearty, 121 R.I. 55, 394 A.2d 1348, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 754 (1978); State v. Robalewski, 418 A.2d 817, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1717 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The specific intent to deprive another permanently of his or her property is an essential element of robbery. State v. Brown, 549 A.2d 1373, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 132 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant was not so intoxicated from drug use as to prevent him from forming the requisite intent to commit the crime of robbery, since the defendant waited until a customer in the store had left before carrying out the robbery, and since the defendant testified that although he was under the influence of drugs during the night in question he was not so intoxicated that he did not know what he was doing or where he was. State v. Bruno, 656 A.2d 948, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 88 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Verdict.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Verdicts of guilty of robbery and not guilty of conspiracy to rob were not legally inconsistent verdicts. State v. Firby, 636 A.2d 1330, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 54 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s conviction of first-degree robbery, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-39-1(a) was affirmed where the court properly certified a police detective as an expert pursuant to R.I. R. Evid. 702, based on the detective’s training in fingerprint analysis and the fact that he processed the crime scene, and the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to R.I. R. Evid. 702, as the court complied with the applicable standard of review, and the record demonstrated that the evidence adduced at trial supported the jury’s verdict. State v. Arroyo, 844 A.2d 163, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 62 (R.I. 2004).</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Every person who shall unlawfully seize a motor vehicle from its lawful owner, lessor, or occupant by use or threat of use of a dangerous weapon against the owner, lessor, or occupant resulting in serious bodily injury, as defined in § 11-5-10.2, shall be guilty of first degree robbery and shall be imprisoned for not less than ten (10) years and may be imprisoned for life, or fined not more than fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), or both. In all such cases, the justice imposing sentence shall impose a minimum sentence of ten (10) years imprisonment and may only impose a sentence less than the minimum if he or she finds that substantial and compelling circumstances exist which justify imposition of the alternative sentence. That finding may be based upon the character and background of the defendant, the cooperation of the defendant with law enforcement authorities, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and/or the nature and quality of the evidence presented at trial. If a sentence which is less than imprisonment for a term of ten (10) years is imposed, the trial justice shall set forth on the record the circumstances which he or she found as justification for imposition of the lesser sentence. A person sentenced to prison for violation of this subsection shall not be eligible for parole until at least one-half (1/2) of the sentence has been served in prison.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Every person who shall unlawfully seize a motor vehicle from its lawful owner, lessor, or occupant by force or threat of force against the owner, lessor, or occupant shall be guilty of second degree robbery and shall be imprisoned for not less than five (5) years nor more than thirty (30) years, or fined not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or both.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Every person who shall commit robbery of a motor vehicle by seizing it from its lawful owner, lessor, or occupant under the circumstances set forth in subsection (a) or (b) of this section, resulting in the death of the owner, lessor or occupant, shall be guilty of first degree murder and shall be sentenced to life imprisonment, and may be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole if ordered by the court pursuant to chapter 19.2 of title 12. A person sentenced to life imprisonment for violation of this subsection shall not be eligible for parole until at least twenty (20) years of the sentence has been served in prison.</p>

Laws § 11-8-3, but not guilty of larceny in excess of $ 500, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-1, the verdicts were not inconsistent because even though an employee saw defendant carrying something out of a business, which was closed for a holiday, and two laptops were missing from the business, the jury could have found defendant not guilty on the actual physical possession or larceny of the item because defendant was not found with the laptops in his possession.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was sufficient evidence to show that defendant intended to steal $7,200 mistakenly given to him by a credit union teller who misread a check the defendant presented for cashing, where there was evidence that defendant knew an extra $7,200 was being given to him and he silently accepted and walked out of the credit union with the overpayment. State v. Hector, 121 R.I. 685, 402 A.2d 595, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2045 (1979).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was not sufficient proof of agency where the defendant had at least as great an interest in the misapplied fund as did the purported principal. State v. Snell, 9 R.I. 112, 1868 R.I. LEXIS 26 (1868).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A del credere factor may be convicted under this section, even though he has guaranteed to his principal the payment of accounts by customers. State v. McAvoy, 40 R.I. 437, 101 A. 109, 1917 R.I. LEXIS 42 (1917).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An agent selling as agent and authorized to collect his principal’s accounts was guilty of embezzlement where he collected accounts and deposited same for his own use, even though under his contract he was charged interest on late payments. State v. McAvoy, 40 R.I. 437, 101 A. 109, 1917 R.I. LEXIS 42 (1917).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A real estate closing attorney who diverted funds to the attorney’s own personal account and returned the money approximately four years later only after an investigation could be found guilty of embezzlement, since a reasonable inference of an intent to permanently deprive the true owner of that money was clear. State v. Champagne, 668 A.2d 311, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 280 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Civil Action.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since this section makes embezzlement the equivalent of larceny, a felony at common law, the former statute requiring criminal prosecution before a civil action would apply to such a case. Struthers v. Peckham, 22 R.I. 8, 45 A. 742, 1900 R.I. LEXIS 30 (1900).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Elements.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The elements to be proven in order to establish the offense of embezzlement are (1) that defendant was entrusted with the property for a specific use, (2) that he came into possession of the property in a lawful manner, often as a result of his employment, and (3) that defendant intended to appropriate and convert the property to his own use and permanently deprive that person of the use. State v. Oliveira, 432 A.2d 664, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1223 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Proof of the employer’s ownership of the property is not an essential element of the crime of embezzlement. State v. Oliveira, 432 A.2d 664, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1223 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though indictment alleged that the money embezzled was “the property of the city of Providence,” the issue of ownership was not an essential element of the crime to be proven in order to sustain a conviction for embezzlement. State v. Oliveira, 432 A.2d 664, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1223 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant, a police officer, who offered to take an allegedly stolen minibike to the police station for storage but who instead discarded the minibike behind a dumpster, thinking that it would never be claimed, was properly convicted of embezzlement and fraudulent conversion under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-3. When the officer discarded the property, he had treated it as his own; it did not matter that he did not benefit or gain personally from his actions. State v. Lough, 899 A.2d 468, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 97 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Embezzlement and Larceny Distinguished.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant could be convicted under this section although the proof showed an offense that would have been larceny at common law. State v. Taberner, 14 R.I. 272, 1883 R.I. LEXIS 58 (1883).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The basic distinction between embezzlement and larceny is that, in embezzlement, the property comes lawfully into the possession of the offender, while in larceny the offender takes it unlawfully in the first instance. State v. Crescenzo, 114 R.I. 242, 332 A.2d 421, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1407 (1975).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Statute of Limitations.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Embezzlement, as a form of larceny, is excepted from the statute of limitations set out in § 12-12-17. Williams v. Smith, 28 R.I. 531, 68 A. 306, 1907 R.I. LEXIS 73 (1907).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to § 12-12-14, a conviction under this section may only be predicated upon proof of offenses that occurred within three years of the bringing of an indictment, information, or complaint and within six months after the time stated in the indictment, information, or complaint. State v. Ricci, 533 A.2d 844, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 564 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Indictment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An indictment that set forth the essential elements of the offense described in the section and left the defendant in no doubt about the crime with which he was charged was sufficient to withstand the constitutional attacks of failure to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation. State v. Crescenzo, 114 R.I. 242, 332 A.2d 421, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1407 (1975).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State did not make out a prima facie case of embezzlement against the defendant, who was employed as director of maintenance for city, and who ordered delivery of carpeting, ceiling tiles, and two steel fire-door units valued at approximately $1,200 to an environmental testing company which in turn rendered services to the city. Although the items were ordered by the defendant and charged to the school department, the defendant secured from the testing company training services for his employees in the removal of hazardous substances and four steel doors, valued at significantly more than $1,200. There was nothing contained in the information package which indicated that the defendant converted the property to his own use. State v. Powers, 644 A.2d 828, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 205 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Weight of the Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s embezzlement convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence, as evidence showed that defendant, an attorney, failed to disburse monies to the proper payees from his trust account and actually spent much of the money on himself, moving money from his trust account at the same time he was taking vacations.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The crime is committed at the moment the victim is fraudulently induced to part with his money or property; it is the amount of that money or the worth of that property that is pivotal, and the extent of a victim’s ultimate loss is immaterial on the issue of the degree of the offense charged, for even proof that a victim has suffered no loss or that the money fraudulently obtained has been returned will not suffice as a defense. State v. Aurgemma, 116 R.I. 425, 358 A.2d 46, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1291 (1976); State v. Auregemma, 117 R.I. 903, 362 A.2d 155, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1652 (1976).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Future Transactions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A misrepresentation with regard to a future transaction, no less than one relating to an existing fact, is a false pretense within the meaning of the statute.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sufficient evidence existed to support a trial court’s finding that in light of a 50-plus job backlog, continuing bad weather, and personnel and equipment problems, defendant deliberately misrepresented his intention to perform homeowners’ paving job within a reasonable time after a certain date; defendant’s misrepresentation of his intention to perform the future obligation of paving constituted a false pretense within the meaning of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-4. State v. Letts, 986 A.2d 1006, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 13 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Indictment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An indictment for obtaining money under false pretenses which followed substantially the express language contained in the statute did not have to allege all of the means or evidentiary facts by which the false pretenses were accomplished.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A motion for judgment of acquittal is properly denied, where there is evidence that the defendant filed a proof of loss with his insurer listing a silver tray as stolen, received a check from the insurer, cashed it, and then later sold the tray without ever notifying the insurer that the tray was not stolen. State v. Henshaw, 557 A.2d 1204, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 69 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s acceptance of a $ 400 deposit from homeowners for a paving job, after intentionally using false pretenses to obtain the deposit, established defendant’s intent to cheat and defraud the homeowners within the meaning of R.I.

Mello v. DaLomba, 798 A.2d 405, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 138 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Statute of Limitations.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to § 12-12-14, a conviction under this section may only be predicated upon proof of offenses that occurred within three years of the bringing of an indictment, information, or complaint and within six months after the time stated in the indictment, information, or complaint. State v. Ricci, 533 A.2d 844, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 564 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction of obtaining property by false pretenses because it showed that defendant’s promise to build the leadership building, the construction of which was never completed, constituted a false pretense, through which defendant obtained almost $550,000 from the victim. State v. Letts, 986 A.2d 1006, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 13 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Use of “Straw” Borrowers.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for obtaining money by false pretenses, the defendant’s motion for acquittal was denied since the defendant was found to have intentionally utilized token or “straw” borrowers in an effort to circumvent the lending limits at certain credit unions, which he had exceeded or nearly exceeded, and since his deceptive actions resulted in the transfer by them of their money. The defendant’s exculpatory testimony, explaining his motives and denying any intent to defraud, were not relevant at the time of his motion under the judgment-of-acquittal standard. State v. LaRoche, 683 A.2d 989, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 228 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Use of Token.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Construction With § 11-8-5.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The nature of the penalty for larceny of property under $500 in value shows that it was a lower offense than breaking and entering contrary to § 11-8-5. State v. Shapiro, 29 R.I. 133, 69 A. 340, 1908 R.I. LEXIS 28 (1908).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Multiple Acts.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A series of wrongful acts will constitute a single offense if the evidence discloses “any intention, one general impulse, and one plan” and the acts can be lumped together to provide the more than $500 requisite to constitute a felony.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supreme Court of Rhode Island held that the trial justice was correct in determining that the general savings clause, R.I. Gen.

If after the initial confrontation with the person under suspicion, the library employee has reasonable grounds to believe that at the time stopped the person was committing or attempting to commit the crime of larceny as set forth in this section or the misdemeanor set forth in § 11-44-15, the employee or agent may detain the person for a time sufficient to summon a police officer to the library. In no case shall the detention be for a period of more than one-half (1/2) hour. The detention must be accomplished in a reasonable manner without unreasonable restraints or excessive force, and may take place only on the premises of the library where the alleged crime occurred. Library premises includes the interior of a building, structure, or other enclosure in which a library facility is located, the exterior appurtenances to any building, structure, or enclosure, and the land on which the building, structure, or other enclosure is located. Any person so stopped by an employee or agent of a library shall promptly identify himself or herself by name and address. Once placed under detention, no other information shall be required of the person and no written and/or signed statement shall be elicited from him or her until a police officer has taken him or her into custody. The employee or agent may however examine, for the purposes of ascertaining whether any book or other library property has been properly checked out by the person, the property which the employee has reasonable grounds to believe were unlawfully taken in violation of this chapter or injured or destroyed in violation of chapter 44 of title 11. Should the person detained refuse to surrender the item for examination, a limited and reasonable search may be conducted. Only packages, shopping bags, handbags, or other property in the immediate possession of the person detained, but not including any clothing worn by the person, may be searched.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> For the purposes of this chapter, “reasonable grounds” includes knowledge that a person has concealed or injured a book or other library property while on the premises or is leaving the premises with the library property without having an employee of the library record the removal of the property from the premises.</p>

Immediately upon stopping the person, the merchant shall identify himself or herself and state his or her reason for stopping the person. If after his or her initial confrontation with the person under suspicion, the merchant has reasonable grounds to believe that at the time stopped the person was committing or attempting to commit the crime of shoplifting on the premises, the merchant may detain the person for a reasonable time sufficient to summon a police officer to the premises. In no case shall the detention be for a period exceeding one hour. Detention must be accomplished in a reasonable manner without unreasonable restraint or excessive force, and may take place only on the premises of the retail mercantile establishment where the alleged shoplifting occurred. Any person so stopped by a merchant pursuant to this section shall promptly identify himself or herself by name and address. Once placed under detention, no other information shall be required of the person and no written and/or signed statement, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, shall be elicited from the person until a police officer has taken him or her into custody.

<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> For the purposes of this section, “reasonable grounds” includes knowledge that a person has concealed unpurchased merchandise of the establishment while on the premises, or has altered or removed identifying labels on merchandise while on the premises, or is leaving the premises with unpurchased concealed or altered merchandise in his or her possession.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Circumstantial Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining whether the natural purport and effect of words was to convey a threat, it would be proper to receive evidence of any circumstance, even if criminal in nature, provided it was connected with the offense charged in such a way that it tends either to establish an intent, motive, plan, design of scheme. State v. Mancini, 108 R.I. 261, 274 A.2d 742, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1258 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence Sufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s letters to his ex-wife included statements that clearly evinced defendant’s subjective intent both to harm his ex-wife and to compel her to pay him money or reconcile against her will; as such, they constituted genuine threats in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-42-2 and were unprotected by the First Amendment. Thus, there was sufficient evidence about the credibility of defendant’s threats to support defendant’s convictions for extortion and blackmail. State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 143 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Government-Funded Contracts.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court erred by granting employer’s motion for judgment as a matter of law after a jury trial on an employee’s claim for damages against a former employer who allegedly issued two paychecks for work the employee did on jobs financed by the State of Rhode Island and the federal government and then required the employee to return one of his paychecks or risk losing his job. Mello v. DaLomba, 798 A.2d 405, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 138 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Multiple Offenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s contention that he was placed twice in jeopardy by being prosecuted for extortion pursuant to this section subsequent to a conviction for assault and battery pursuant to § 11-5-3 was without merit, since assault and battery, which is the intentional and unlawful application of the slightest force to the person of another, and extortion, which consists of a verbal threat to place a victim in peril of actual bodily harm accompanied by an intent to compel that victim to do an act against his will, require proof of different elements and hence do not satisfy the “same evidence” test applied by the court. State v. Davis, 120 R.I. 82, 384 A.2d 1061, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 764 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Double jeopardy was found in a particular case where, in order to prove both extortion and assault with intent to rob, the state had to demonstrate the identical elements of an intentional threat to the victim that placed him in fear of actual bodily harm, the purpose of which was to force him to give the defendant money, and proof of no additional fact was required to establish both crimes. State v. Pope, 414 A.2d 781, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1640 (R.I. 1980), overruled in part, State v. Acquisto, 463 A.2d 122, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1012 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Conviction for extortion and blackmail under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-42-2 requires proof of both a threat and of intent to force someone to act against his or her will, and unique to a conviction for violating a no-contact order is the requirement that a no-contact order be in place; thus, the two crimes require proof of separate and additional facts that the other does not. State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 143 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Refusal to Discharge Mortgage.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the mortgagee acted well within its rights when refusing to give advance assurance that it would discharge the property mortgage, the defendants’ counterclaims based upon alleged violations of this section and the state’s anti-racketeering law, §§ 7-15-1 through 7-15-11, must be dismissed; the mortgagee’s duty to discharge was simply never triggered. National Credit Union Admin. Bd. v. Regine, 795 F. Supp. 59, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7577 (D.R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Requirements.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Irrespective of how the crime of extortion may be defined in other states, the only requirement for establishment of the crime under the statute is that the specified threat be made with intent to extort. State v. Mancini, 108 R.I. 261, 274 A.2d 742, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1258 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In applying this section, the focus should be on the defendant and his or her subjective intent as demonstrated by his or her conduct and by the words he or she used; how the incident would be perceived by a reasonable person is not an element of the crime of extortion. State v. Price, 706 A.2d 929, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 34 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The requirement of a threat of injury to the person is ambiguous and being penal in nature requires narrow construction and does not include danger to reputation. State v. Simmons, 114 R.I. 16, 327 A.2d 843, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1053 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The crime of extortion consists of two basic elements: a verbal threat to place a victim in peril of bodily harm or of harm to his property, accompanied by an intent to compel the victim to do an act against his will. State v. Sabitoni, 434 A.2d 1339, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1265 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Injury threatened without the intent to compel the person threatened to act unwillingly in the future is not extortion. State v. Pule, 453 A.2d 1095, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1116 (R.I. 1982).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Construction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-42-4 sets out a single offense, that of threatening a public official, which can take the form of either a threat to that official’s life, or of a threat to that official’s bodily safety; the plain language of § 11-42-4 indicates, therefore, that the General Assembly intended to create only one offense under that statute. Thus, a State’s charge that defendant threatened public officials with death was charge of violating § 11-42-4, and the trial justice was not obligated to instruct the jurors that they could convict defendant only if they found he had threatened public officials with death. State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 143 (R.I. 2004).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The following explanatory notes accompanied P.L. 1979, ch. 304, § 1:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“This act revises chapter 11-45 of the general laws by repealing sections 11-45-1 through 11-45-11 and replacing them with section 11-45-1 entitled, ‘Disorderly conduct.’ The provisions originally contained in chapter 11-45 covered vagrancy, drunkards, disorderly conduct and a plethora of minor offenses and status crimes many of which have their origins in English legislation of the feudal era when vagrancy laws served both to deter serfs from leaving their lords as well as to control scarce labor in the aftermath of the plagues that swept England in the fourteenth century. Subsequently these statutes were expanded and used to control wandering bands of robbers as well as beggars. For a fuller description, see text to accompany Tent. Draft No. 13, Model Penal Code 60-65 (1961). Similar provisions were adopted in some form or other by most of the American states. The provisions contained in sections 11-45-1 through 11-45-11 are fairly typical. In a series of relatively recent decisions, the United States supreme court has held restrictions similar to those contained in chapter 11-45 to be unconstitutionally vague as well as to infringe rights of free speech and assembly. See e.g., Bachellar v. Maryland, 397 U.S. 564, 90 S. Ct. 1312, 25 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1970); Palmer v. City of Euclid, 402 U.S. 544, 91 S. Ct. 1563, 29 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1971); Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 92 S. Ct. 859, 31 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1972). See also Thompson v. City of Louisville, 362 U.S. 199 (1960). As a result, Rhode Island has not for some time had an enforceable law dealing with a variety of activities which are generally classified as disorderly conduct.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“This act is designed to fill that gap in Rhode Island law by prohibiting six specific types of conduct, which, if carefully delineated, can be regulated by the state. The statute has been drafted so as to explicitly define the prohibited conduct while not intruding upon constitutionally protected activities. Essentially, the act prescribes types of conduct which are breaches of the peace or create serious nuisances. For example, subsections (a) and (c) are intended to prevent or to punish violent behavior which the state has an interest in controlling under its obligations to maintain the public peace. See e.g., Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (1942). In addition, the statute seeks to control conduct which is essentially a nuisance, although not leading to an imminent breach of peace. Examples of these are found in subdivisions (b) and (f).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“With the exception of verbal expressions ‘which by this very utterance . . . tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace,’ the act does not attempt to regulate or punish other varieties of, so-called, ‘offensive language’. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra at 572. The commission deliberated at length over the question of whether in the light of recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court it is reasonably possible to draft a constitutionally valid statute dealing with this problem. After a review of the various authorities, it was the commission’s considered judgment that, other than the prohibition contained in subdivision (c) against ‘fighting word’, it is not feasible to draft legislation dealing with other types of offensive utterance. See Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 91 S. Ct. 1780, 29 L. Ed. 2d 284 (1971); Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518, 92 S. Ct. 1103, 31 L. Ed. 2d 408 (1972); Rosenfeld v. New Jersey, 408 U.S. 901 (1972); Brown v. Oklahoma, 408 U.S. 914 (1972); Lewis v. New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130, 94 S. Ct. 1028, 39 L. Ed. 2d 123 (1974). See also Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 334 N.E. 2d 617 (Mass. 1975). It is the commission’s judgment, however, that to a large extent the most serious problems in this area of concern are encompassed in the act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“By repealing chapter 11-45 of the general laws, section 11-45-2 was also repealed. Contained in that section were certain procedural guidelines for the prosecution of nonsupport cases. Those provisions were transferred to chapter 11-2 and the vague provisions of ‘habitual drunkard’ was deleted from section 11-2-1.”</p>

State v. Russell, 890 A.2d 453, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 9 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Dismissal of information against defendant charging disorderly conduct, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 11-45-1, 12-29-5, and 12-29-2, was upheld on appeal where defendant demonstrated that, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-1-2, disorderly conduct was classified as a petty misdemeanor and, by its terms, R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-5(c) provided for enhanced penalties for anyone convicted of an offense punishable as a misdemeanor; therefore a violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-45-1(a) was exempt from the sentencing enhancements of R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-5. State v. Martini, 860 A.2d 689, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 178 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Disorderly conduct statute was not void for vagueness and did not prohibit arrest and prosecution where defendant’s alleged disorderly conduct occurred inside his home; the statute put him on notice that he violated that statute if he intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly engaged in fighting, threatening, violent, or tumultuous behavior without regard to the location where that happened, and, thus, defendant could appreciate that throwing furniture around his residence during a violent argument with his wife, in which he threatened to destroy the home if he did not get his way, was prohibited conduct.

<p class="p7"><b>Evidence Sufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the trial justice found the State’s witnesses credible, and that defendant struck the victim and engaged in other tumultuous behavior, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for disorderly conduct. State v. Hesford, 900 A.2d 1194, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 129 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of domestic simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct because neither the purported inconsistencies in the victim’s testimony nor any contradictory evidence undermined defendant’s convictions as the victim told the responding officer that defendant had beat her and kicked her, punched her, and stomped on her; the officer observed bruises on her forehead, face, and chin area; defendant admitted to the officer that he had hit and punched the victim after she had slapped him; and an emergency room physician testified that the victim presented with an ear contusion and lacerations, hand contusion, ankle abrasion, and a blow to the head, and that she was discharged after receiving 10 sutures. State v. Van Dongen, 132 A.3d 1070, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 31 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Fighting Words.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant, convicted under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-45-1, contended that his speech constituted protected speech under the First Amendment and not “fighting words”, the trial court did not err in denying his motion for a new trial after finding that the troopers’ testimony was credible, defendant directed his speech at the two troopers, the troopers were concerned and alarmed by defendant’s words, and defendant was not a mere bystander or uninvolved in the troopers’ immediate purpose in coming to the scene.

<p class="p6">It is hereby declared to be the policy of the state to prohibit unreasonable, excessive and annoying noise levels from all sources subject to its police power. At certain levels, low frequency sound (between 100-20 cps) when substantially amplified, often referred to as sub-woofer frequency, can be extremely penetrating, disturbing and poses a danger to the health and safety of the individual using equipment creating the sound, and to other individuals in the immediate area from which the sound is being generated. The noise being generated may originate from radios, CD players, DVD players, tape players, televisions and other audio-producing equipment.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Conviction for crime of violence following conviction for assault with a deadly weapon, where all elements of the former crime are included in proof of the latter, was double jeopardy. State v. Boudreau, 113 R.I. 497, 322 A.2d 626, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1203 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Convicting defendant of both assault with a deadly weapon pursuant to § 11-5-2 and possession of a pistol during commission of a crime of violence pursuant to this section was unconstitutional, as both convictions stemmed from the same incident. State v. Grullon, 117 R.I. 682, 371 A.2d 265, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1739 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where two crimes of violence — robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon — were committed at the same time as part of the same criminal transaction, the state could not single out the robbery as the underlying crime of violence for a charge of committing a crime of violence while armed and thereby evade the double-jeopardy violation that would result from using the assault charge as the underlying crime of violence. State v. Ashness, 461 A.2d 659, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 959 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where possession of the same shotgun and possession of the same cocaine served as the basis for charges of possession of cocaine while having available a shotgun, and possession of a shotgun while committing a crime of violence, being in possession of cocaine, double jeopardy attached. In re Malik D., 730 A.2d 1070, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 136 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant waived an argument that convictions and separate sentences for second-degree murder and carrying a dangerous weapon in the commission of a crime of violence violated double jeopardy guarantees by failing to raise it in a pretrial motion; nonetheless, the court ruled on the merits and held in furtherance of Rodriguez, that the two crimes were separate for double jeopardy purposes as each required an element that the other did not, namely, commission of a murder and the carrying of a dangerous weapon. State v. McGuy, 841 A.2d 1109, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 209 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Dual convictions for carrying a dangerous weapon when committing a crime of violence and first-degree robbery did not constitute a double jeopardy violation because each offense included an additional element of proof that was not contained in the other; the jury could have returned a verdict of guilty on the robbery charge based on either defendant’s use of a dangerous weapon or the injury inflicted upon the victim, while the conviction for committing a crime of violence while armed or having available a firearm did not require that the weapon be used or that there be an injury to the victim.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Imposition of two consecutive terms of life imprisonment for first-degree murder and using a firearm while committing a crime of violence resulting in death did not violate Eighth Amendment or R.I. Const. art. I, § 8; the sentence imposed was mandatory and the crime was precisely that type the Legislature intended to address when it provided for a mandatory consecutive life sentence for using a firearm while committing murder. State v. Monteiro, 924 A.2d 784, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 81 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-3.2(b)(3) and (c), imposing a mandatory consecutive sentence for discharging a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence with death resulting, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Killers who used firearms during a robbery were not a suspect class, and the legislature could rationally conclude that making penalties harsher for people using a firearm during a robbery which resulted in death would act as a deterrence that would save lives. State v. DeJesus, 947 A.2d 873, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 64 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s convictions and sentences for using a firearm to commit second-degree murder and second degree murder did not violate double jeopardy because (1) each crime required proof of a fact the other did not, and (2) the legislature intended consecutive sentences under the circumstances. Linde v. State, 78 A.3d 738, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 135 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s consecutive life sentence for using a firearm to commit second-degree murder did not violate the Eighth Amendment or R.I. Const. art. I, § 8 because (1) no violation had been found in the context of first-degree murder, and that holding did not depend on the classification of murder, and (2) the legislature intended the sentence to apply to crimes such as defendant’s. Linde v. State, 78 A.3d 738, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 135 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s convictions satisfied the <i>Blockburger </i>different-crimes test (separate elements of murder and using a firearm), and even if the test was not satisfied, the legislature clearly intended consecutive sentences under R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Constitutional challenges to the imposition of a mandatory life sentence of imprisonment upon defendant’s conviction for discharge of a firearm while committing a crime of violence resulting in death, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-3.2, which was to run consecutive to a sentence imposed for his conviction of second-degree murder, were not improper in a R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 motion, as the sentence was not illegal; the trial court had no discretion but to impose the mandatory, consecutive life sentence in the circumstances. State v. Linde, 965 A.2d 415, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 20 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>First defendant and second defendant’s contention, that the singular-person language of R.I. Gen. Laws 11-47-3.2(b)(3) required the State to prove a particular defendant personally discharged a firearm resulting in death or injury, dictated that they be acquitted because the State could not do so had to be rejected. Vicarious liability applied to that firearm statute, and R.I. Gen. Stat. § 43-3-4 dictated that in interpreting a state statute, every word importing the singular number only could be construed to extend to and to include the plural number also. State v. Ros, 973 A.2d 1148, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 96 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Admissibility of Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for using a firearm while committing a crime of violence, the trial court properly admitted a statement the victim made to police, soon after defendant shot him, to tell his father he loved him, as it tended to establish that he was injured by the discharge of the firearm, and any prejudice to defendant paled in comparison to the impact of seeing the victim testify from a wheelchair about the incidents leading to his permanent paralysis. State v. Covington, 69 A.3d 855, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 123 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Consecutive Sentences.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court properly denied defendant’s application for postconviction relief because, inter alia, defendant’s contention that the trial justice erred by sentencing him to life without parole for first-degree murder followed by a consecutive life sentence under § 11-47-3.2—was barred by the doctrine of res judicata in § 10-9.1-8; further, defendant did not file a motion to reduce his sentence under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35, and § 11-47-3.2 mandated that his sentence under that statute was to run consecutively to any other sentence imposed. Graham v. State, 229 A.3d 63, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 43 (R.I. 2020).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Double Jeopardy.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not entitled to acquittal on double jeopardy grounds as to convictions for discharging a firearm in commission of a crime of violence and assault with intent to murder because the legislature clearly intended multiple sentences for such convictions arising from one incident.

<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Evidence.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statutory language of this section is unambiguous and requires no interpretation. State v. Anthony, 422 A.2d 921, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1852 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Constructive Possession.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The evidence was sufficient to establish the defendant’s constructive possession of a firearm since it was clearly established that the gun was seized from the defendant’s apartment over which he exercised dominion and control. State v. Mastracchio, 672 A.2d 438, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 42 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since defendant was also convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon in addition to possessing it as a convicted felon, a jury instruction regarding constructive possession was superfluous and harmless. State v. Fisher, 844 A.2d 112, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 55 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial because there was ample evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that defendant was in constructive possession of a gun found in his girlfriend’s apartment; the testimony reflected that defendant spent considerable time at the apartment, his name was on the mailbox, and the girlfriend testified that she had no experience with or understanding of firearms. State v. Yon, 161 A.3d 1118, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 83 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence — Sufficiency.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Convictions under this section were upheld where firearms were in plain view of arresting officers. Ouimette v. Howard, 468 F.2d 1363, 1972 U.S. App. LEXIS 6891 (1st Cir. 1972); State v. Ouimette, 108 R.I. 283, 274 A.2d 732, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1261 (1971); State v. Carillo, 113 R.I. 32, 317 A.2d 449, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1133 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Prior Convictions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the state introduced evidence that the defendant had previously been convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon in order to establish the pending charge of possession of a firearm after conviction of a crime of violence, the trial court was under no obligation to, <i>sua sponte</i>, give an immediate limiting instruction, but properly addressed the matter in his final charge to the jury. State v. Mastracchio, 672 A.2d 438, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 42 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since it was the Rhode Island General Assembly’s clear and unambiguous intent, manifested just as lucidly in R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-5 and R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-2(4), that Rhode Island law governed whether a foreign conviction qualified as a predicate “crime of violence” under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-5, the use of defendant’s Arizona arson conviction under Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-1703 as a predicate offense under R.I. § 11-47-5 was proper as the <i>mens rea </i>requirement in Arizona exceeded the <i>mens rea </i>requirement in R.I. Gen. Laws 11-4-3 and thus was merely superfluous. State v. Menard, 888 A.2d 57, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 216 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Prior Juvenile Adjudication.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A prior juvenile adjudication constitutes a conviction within the context of this section for the exclusive purposes of family court proceedings. In re Bernard H., 557 A.2d 864, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 76 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sentence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A trial justice did not err by failing to apply the “rule of lenity” when he entered judgments of conviction both under this section and § 11-23-1 because these sections represent two distinct statutory offenses and one requires proof of an additional fact that the other does not. State v. Anthony, 422 A.2d 921, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1852 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Speedy Trial.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant’s state and federal constitutional rights to a speedy trial were violated, requiring vacating of his conviction for possession of a firearm charge in violation of this section that was brought to trial almost 11 years after the defendant’s indictment. State v. Powers, 643 A.2d 827, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 201 (R.I. 1994).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute is not an unconstitutional infringement of the right to keep and bear arms assured by Rhode Island Const., art. 1, § 22. State v. Storms, 112 R.I. 121, 308 A.2d 463, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 962 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This statute is not unconstitutional because Rhode Island Const., art. 1, § 23, providing that the enumeration of rights in the declaration of rights is not to be construed to impair rights retained by the people, does not guarantee a right of self-defense. State v. Storms, 112 R.I. 121, 308 A.2d 463, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 962 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant is charged with carrying a pistol without a license the defendant has the burden of raising the issue of license or justification in the first instance and once the issue has been raised the burden would be upon the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of the offense charged. State v. Neary, 122 R.I. 506, 409 A.2d 551, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1569 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although § 11-47-27 creates an implication that possession of a handgun in violation of § 11-47-8 constitutes evidence that such possession was unlawful, such a statutory inference does not relieve the state of its constitutional burden to prove that defendant’s possession of the weapon was unlawful. Section 11-47-27 does nothing more than shift the evidentiary burden of production to the defendant, and once the defendant has raised the issue of justification and has satisfied the burden of production, the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant’s possession was unlawful shifts back to the state. In re Samuel P., 626 A.2d 224, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 170 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since it is incumbent upon the prosecution to prove every element of charged offenses the prosecutor, in his opening to the trial jury, had every right to outline in good faith the evidence that the state intended to present, even if included in the recitation were details relating to other uncharged substantive offenses. State v. Morris, 744 A.2d 850, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 16 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>“Carrying” or “Possession.”</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Carry” and “possession” involve largely the same legal ramifications. State v. Benevides, 425 A.2d 77, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1030 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The essential element of “carry” in this section means an intentional control of the designated object with the knowledge of its nature. State v. Benevides, 425 A.2d 77, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1030 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The element of possession or carrying is not conditioned on the time that a person has an item under control: knowing or conscious contact with an item, albeit fleeting and momentary, is sufficient to constitute possession or carrying. State v. Benevides, 425 A.2d 77, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1030 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence sufficiently supported the inference that a discarded gun had been carried by the defendant and discarded by him, and that it was operable until damaged in being discarded. State v. Benevides, 425 A.2d 77, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1030 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was sufficient for a conviction under subsection (c) since the defendant, while a passenger in a van, had in his possession heroin that he later transferred to an informant and, en route to the delivery, he was aware of a gun which was loaded and strategically positioned toward the passenger side of the van. Constructive possession can occur when an individual exercises dominion and control over an object even though it is not within his physical possession. State v. Reyes, 671 A.2d 1236, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 51 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was sufficient under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-8(a) to establish that defendant had constructive possession of the firearm that was found in a vehicle that was registered to defendant’s girlfriend, because defendant was the only driver of the vehicle who was aware of the gun’s presence, as defendant had admitted to knowledge of the gun’s presence, and defendant’s girlfriend, the only other driver of the vehicle, denied knowledge of the gun’s presence. State v. Arenas, 800 A.2d 432, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 155 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Double Jeopardy.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where possession of the same shotgun and possession of the same cocaine served as the basis for charges of possession of cocaine while having available a shotgun, and possession of a shotgun while committing a crime of violence, being in possession of cocaine, double jeopardy attached. In re Malik D., 730 A.2d 1070, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 136 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s convictions satisfied the <i>Blockburger </i>different-crimes test (separate elements of murder and using a firearm), and even if the test was not satisfied, the legislature clearly intended consecutive sentences under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-3.2(c) such that defendant’s sentences did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy in R.I. Const. art. 1, § 7. State v. Rodriguez, 822 A.2d 894, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 113 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Dwelling-House Exception.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The dwelling-house exception set forth in this section was applicable in a case in which the defendant was found in possession of a handgun in the attic of a building designed or once used as a multifamily dwelling, where the evidence showed that the defendant’s family, by use of the building, had exclusive control over the hallway and the attic so as to constitute the premises of the dwelling house pursuant to this section and the state did not present any evidence showing the existence of any tenancies or independent living units within the building. In re Samuel P., 626 A.2d 224, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 170 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Joinder.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Charge of malicious killing of an animal was properly not severed from a charge of possession of a sawed-off shotgun, when defendant argued the denial of defendant’s motion to sever denied defendant the ability to testify in defense of the first charge due to a risk defendant would be cross-examined to fill a gap in the State’s evidence as to the second charge because defendant did not sufficiently show prejudice, as defendant’s testimony was not required to prove the State’s case as to the second charge, since the State had overwhelming evidence supporting that charge. State v. Goulet, 21 A.3d 302, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 80 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Knowledge and Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Conviction required a knowing or conscious carrying of an unlicensed pistol or revolver and trial court’s failure to instruct on question of knowledge was error. State v. Russo, 113 R.I. 248, 319 A.2d 655, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1167 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the sole issue in a case under this section is whether defendant was licensed to carry a weapon, his reasons for carrying the weapon were irrelevant. State v. Pope, 414 A.2d 781, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1640 (R.I. 1980), overruled in part, State v. Acquisto, 463 A.2d 122, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1012 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly refused to instruct the jury that defendant was not guilty, under R.I. Gen Laws § 11-47-8(a), if he honestly and reasonably believed that he had unloaded the gun before transporting it; defendant’s proposed instruction was legally incorrect, because even if the unloaded requirement was met by defendant’s mistaken belief that such was the case, he could have been convicted of a violation of § 11-47-8(a) on the ground that the gun was not securely wrapped, as was required by R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-9. State v. Keiser, 796 A.2d 471, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 71 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Search and Seizure.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As defendant was not under arrest when a police officer handcuffed him and placed him in her cruiser for her own safety, she did not need probable cause to do so; and as he was detained only long enough for her to search his car for weapons, the trial court properly denied his motion to suppress a revolver and ammunition she found in his car. State v. Santos, 64 A.3d 314, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to suppress a gun and ammunition seized from his car, as a police officer had a reasonable belief that he might be armed and dangerous based on her observation of loose bullets in his car; his furtive movements and avoidance of eye contact; his positioning of his hands so she could not see them; and her discovery of a knife during a cursory pat-down of his clothing. State v. Santos, 64 A.3d 314, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the weapon used in the murder and both rounds which hit the victim were fired from the same weapon and from the same direction and that defendant fired those rounds, defendant was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal as to the charges of second-degree murder, discharging a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence resulting in the death of another, and unlicensed possession of a firearm. State v. Reyes, 984 A.2d 606, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 144 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As an officer found a revolver within reaching distance of defendant, in a vehicle he was operating, and as he had moved toward the area where the gun was later found, the evidence was sufficient to convict him of violating R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-8(a); therefore, the trial court properly denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal. State v. Santos, 64 A.3d 314, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 2013).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When viewed in its entirety, the statutory framework of the Firearms Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 11, ch. 47, serves to vindicate an individual’s right to keep and bear arms and the licensing scheme set forth in the Firearms Act, R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 11-47-11(a) and 11-47-18, is reasonable legislative regulation of weapons that falls squarely within the State’s police power. Mosby v. Devine, 851 A.2d 1031, 2004 R.I.

<p class="p7"><b>Application Improperly Denied.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Decision denying an application for a license to carry a concealed weapon was quashed where the chief of police incorrectly required a proper showing of need, a showing of need was not a component under R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an applicant’s action seeking review of a police chief’s decision to deny his application for a permit or license to carry a concealed weapon, a remand was the appropriate remedy because a determination as to the applicant’s suitability required findings of fact best left to the licensing authority and not the Supreme Court; the documents the police chief submitted revealed a troubling history of events that called into question the applicant’s suitability to carry a concealed weapon.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-18 does not impose an express limitation on the Rhode Island Department of the Attorney General’s decision-making authority. Thus, § 11-47-18 does not implicitly require a hearing, and filing an application to carry a concealed weapon under that statute does not create a “contested case” under the Administrative Procedure Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 42, ch. 35. Mosby v. Devine, 851 A.2d 1031, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 120 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Appeal.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rhode Island Attorney General must adhere to minimum procedural requirements when rejecting an application filed under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-18; a rejected applicant is entitled to know the evidence upon which the Rhode Island Department of the Attorney General based its decision and the rationale for the denial. Armed with this information, an aggrieved applicant can petition the Supreme Court of Rhode Island for a writ of certiorari so that it may review the department’s decision for error of law, and, in conducting such a review, the court will not weigh the evidence nor substitute its judgment for that of the fact finder, but, rather, it will inspect the record to determine whether the department’s findings are supported by any legally competent evidence. Mosby v. Devine, 851 A.2d 1031, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 120 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 42, ch. 35, to review the denial of an applicant’s request to carry a concealed weapon under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-18 by the Rhode Island Department of the Attorney General because: (1) the application did not have an impact on the right of the people to keep and bear arms under R.I. Const. art. I, § 2; and (2) R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-18 did not require a hearing on an individual’s application for a gun permit; thus, the decision was not a contested case. The only method to obtain judicial review of a denial of an application filed under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-18 is to seek a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court of Rhode Island. Mosby v.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> No property right shall exist in any firearm unlawfully possessed, carried, or used, and all unlawful firearms are hereby declared to be nuisances and forfeited to the state.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> When a firearm is lawfully seized, confiscated from or turned in by any person, it shall be placed in the custody of the superintendent of state police or the chief of police in the city or town in which it was seized, confiscated or turned in to. The officer who takes custody of the firearm shall promptly ascertain, using available record keeping systems, including, but not limited to, the National Crime Information Center, whether the firearm has been reported stolen and if stolen shall notify the reporting law enforcement agency of the recovery of said firearm. If the police department in the city or town in which the firearm was seized or confiscated has not been notified by a justice of the superior court or the attorney general that the firearm is necessary as evidence in a criminal or civil matter, it shall be returned to the lawful owner. However, any owner of a firearm who shall knowingly fail to report the loss or theft of the firearm to the proper law enforcement authorities shall not be entitled to its return.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> If a firearm is found not to be stolen and the owner cannot be readily ascertained within ninety (90) days subsequent to the seizure or confiscation of said firearm and the firearm is no longer necessary as evidence in a criminal or civil matter, the police department having custody of the firearm shall have the option of either: (1) destroying said firearm by rendering it permanently and irretrievably inoperable; (2) transferring custody of said firearms to the state crime laboratory for the purpose of criminal investigation; or (3) holding an auction of those firearms seized, confiscated or turned in to said police department; provided, however, any firearms to be transferred at auction shall be limited to antique firearms or curios or relics. For purposes of this section, “an antique firearm” shall be defined as any firearm (including any firearm with a matchlock, flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of ignition system) manufactured on or before 1899, and any replica of such firearm if such replica is not designed or redesigned for using rim-fire or conventional center fire fixed ammunition, or uses rim-fire or conventional center fire fixed ammunition which is no longer manufactured in the United States and which is not readily available in the ordinary channels of commercial trade. “Curios or relics” shall be defined as firearms which are of special interest to collectors by reason of some quality other than is associated with firearms intended for sporting use or as offensive or defensive weapons. To be recognized as curios or relics, firearms must be manufactured at least fifty (50) years prior to the current date, but not including replicas thereof, and firearms which derive a substantial part of their monetary value from the fact that they are novel, rare, bizarre, or because of their association with some historical figure, period, or event.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> In the event that an auction is held, bidders shall be limited to bona fide holders of a valid Federal Firearms License for Retail Sale or a Federal Firearms Collector License. Any auction shall be advertised at least once a week for a period of three (3) weeks preceding the date of the auction in a newspaper of general circulation, said notice clearly stating the time, location and terms of said auction. All funds realized shall be used to purchase and provide necessary safety equipment, including, but not limited to, bulletproof vests, for the police department holding the auction and shall not revert to any general fund of the state, city or town, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> All firearms received by any police department in any manner shall be entered in the department’s permanent records and listed by make, model, caliber and serial number and the manner in which said firearm was disposed of and, if by auction, the name and federal license number of the buyer. A copy of said record shall be forwarded to the office of the Rhode Island Attorney General and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of the United States Treasury Department on at least an annual basis.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although this section creates an implication that the possession of a handgun in violation of § 11-47-8 constitutes evidence that such possession was unlawful, such a statutory inference does not relieve the state of its constitutional burden to prove that the defendant’s possession of the weapon was unlawful. This section does nothing more than shift the evidentiary burden of production to the defendant, and once the defendant has raised the issue of justification and has satisfied the burden of production, the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant’s possession was unlawful shifts back to the state. In re Samuel P., 626 A.2d 224, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 170 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Essential Elements.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statutory presumption made defendant’s carrying of an unlicensed pistol or revolver unlawful but did not go to the question of defendant’s knowledge which was an essential element of the crime.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the language defining harassment is phrased in the alternative, the fact that a victim may not have been in fear of bodily injury is irrelevant if the defendant’s conduct would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress.

Gen. Law § 11-59-1(2) to show that defendant intended to “seriously alarm, annoy, or bother” her, in contravention of R.I. Gen. Law § 11-59-2. Moreover, the probative value did not substantially outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice under R.I. R. Evid. 403. State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 143 (R.I. 2004).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The language of this section prior to the 1995 amendment gave adequate warning to potential offenders of the conduct that was prohibited; it defies logic to conclude that a defendant would have to commit more than one series of harassing acts in order to be found guilty of stalking. Thus, this section as originally enacted passed constitutional muster and was not so ambiguously worded as to have been unconstitutionally vague. State v. Fonseca, 670 A.2d 1237, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 31 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s conviction of misdemeanor stalking, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-59-2 was affirmed; the version of the statute in effect at the time the crime was committed was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. XIV, as the evidence established that defendant’s unsolicited contact with the victim was unwelcome. State v. Stierhoff, 879 A.2d 425, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 70 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence Sufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once an earlier episode of stalking had been recounted to the jury for the purpose of reflecting on the victim’s state of mind, the timing and circumstances of four new communications, unthreatening though they may have been in isolation, became clear, and the evidence was sufficient for a finding of harassment beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Breen, 767 A.2d 50, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 61 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An envelope, which was sent by defendant to his ex-wife, and its contents, which were materials related to the prevention of domestic violence, were properly admitted in defendant’s trial for violation of a no-contact order and stalking because although the contents of the envelope did not make it any more or less probable that defendant intentionally contacted his ex-wife in violation of the no-contact order, they were relevant to the charges of stalking under R.I. Gen. Law § 11-59-1(2) to show that defendant intended to “seriously alarm, annoy, or bother” her, in contravention of R.I. Gen. Law § 11-59-2. Moreover, the probative value did not substantially outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice under R.I. R. Evid. 403. State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 143 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s conviction of misdemeanor stalking, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-59-2 was affirmed; under the version of the law in effect at the time the crime was committed, the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to dismiss the action, as the State presented conclusive evidence that defendant was aware that his advances toward the victim were unwelcome, which satisfied the definition of harassment under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-59-1. State v. Stierhoff, 879 A.2d 425, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 70 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was not entitled to dismissal of stalking charges because defendant was not entitled to prior notice that defendant’s acts were disturbing or unwanted, as this section barred willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly following another to put that person in reasonable fear of bodily injury, and required no direct victim contact. State v. Kolsoi, 126 A.3d 487, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 118 (R.I. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Three of five victims’ testimony was not required to show the victims’ reasonable fear of bodily injury because (1) the victims traveled together and the State said their testimony would have been the same as those who testified, so the testimony would have been cumulative, (2) this section required only proof of defendant’s intent to put another in reasonable fear of bodily injury, and (3) testifying victims and surveillance footage sufficiently showed defendant directed defendant’s acts toward all five victims. State v. Kolsoi, 126 A.3d 487, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 118 (R.I. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Legitimate Purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The absence of a precise statutory definition of “legitimate purpose” was not fatal to the state’s case against a defendant accused of stalking in light of the substantial evidence that the defendant was amply aware that his continued communications were unwelcome. State v. Breen, 767 A.2d 50, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 61 (R.I. 2001).</p>

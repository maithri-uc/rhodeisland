<p class="p7"><b>Authority of Court.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Superior Court lacked the inherent power to remove entries relating to criminal matters from a Bureau of Criminal Identification (BCI) report since such power to disregard the specific criteria and limitations on the expungement and sealing of BCI records as set forth in the statute would render those criteria and limitations nugatory. State v. Manocchio, 743 A.2d 555, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 8 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>First Offender.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When reading the “first-offender” definition from R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-1.3-1 in conjunction with R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-1.3-3, “first offender” meant one who had been convicted of only one offense; thus, defendants, who had multiple convictions, were not entitled to expungement. State v. Badessa, 869 A.2d 61, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 39 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sealing of Records.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plea of nolo contendere followed by probation would not preclude a defendant from sealing his or her records because in the sealing context, the affected person has been acquitted or exonerated, whereas a person seeking to have his or her records expunged has not; therefore, sealing should be more widely available to those individuals than to those seeking to have their records expunged.

<p class="p6">The general assembly finds and declares that DNA databanks and DNA databases are important tools in criminal investigations, in the exclusion of individuals who are the subject of criminal investigations or prosecutions, and in deterring and detecting recidivism. Many states have enacted laws requiring persons arrested for, or convicted of, a crime of violence, or persons convicted of any felony, to provide genetic samples for DNA profiling. Moreover, it is the policy of this state to assist federal, state, and local criminal justice and law enforcement agencies in the identification and detection of individuals in criminal investigations. It is therefore in the best interest of the state to establish a DNA databank and a DNA database containing DNA samples and DNA records of individuals arrested for any crime of violence as defined in § 12-1.5-2, or convicted of certain sexual and violent offenses, or convicted of any felony as defined in the general laws of Rhode Island, and missing persons.</p>

The DNA record is the result obtained from the DNA typing tests. The DNA record is comprised of the characteristics of a DNA sample that are of value only in establishing the identity of individuals. The DNA record, however, does not include the DNA sample, and the DNA record may never include the results of tests of any structural genes.

<p class="p7"><b>Construction With § 45-24-6.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former section 45-24-6 clearly provides a town with the authority to enact penalties for violations of town ordinances, but it in no way overrules this section in regard to which court has jurisdiction to try such offenses.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rhode Island superior court did not have original jurisdiction of misdemeanor crimes because R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-3-1 conferred original jurisdiction of misdemeanor offenses in the district court, thus, where defendant’s felony conviction was vacated, because at best, defendant’s violation was a misdemeanor, the case was remanded with directions to transfer the case to the district court.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since it was clear that the district court had jurisdiction over misdemeanor prosecutions for driving under the influence, the superior court likewise had jurisdiction over an appeal de novo as of right from a guilty finding of the district court; whether the evidence actually showed the elements of the offense was an issue separate from subject matter jurisdiction.

The very language of the 1969 Judicial Reorganization Act, the act under which the judge retired, provides that retired justices possess “all powers and authority” of a District Court judge, but only “[w]hen so assigned and performing such service.” Since the retired judge was not performing those duties at the time he signed the search warrant, the search warrant was invalid.

<p class="p7"><b>Identity of Perpetrator of Crime.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court erred in suppressing the DNA results of a buccal swab taken from defendant while he was incarcerated because the court was statutorily authorized to issue the subject warrants, the manner of obtaining the swab was necessitated by defendant’s refusal to comply, despite being given multiple opportunities to do so, the State was not required to return to court to seek a contempt order, defendant’s reasons for refusing were pretextual, and there was nothing inappropriate or excessive about the force used in seizing the swab of a recalcitrant and hyperbolic suspect. State v. Querido, 229 A.3d 410, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 46 (R.I. 2020).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Property.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Blood sample was neither “property” within the ordinary meaning of the statute authorizing a superior court to issue search warrants nor under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 41, which authorized issuance of warrants in appropriate cases; therefore, a court order for seizure of a child molestation suspect’s blood sample and a subsequent warrant authorizing the involuntary taking of a sample were both quashed. State v. Dearmas, 841 A.2d 659, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 34 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In light of the Rhode Island Supreme Court’s opinions in DiStefano and in Dearmas, a trial court erred in issuing a search warrant authorizing the seizure of samples of defendant’s blood, as this exceeded the trial court’s authority under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-5-2, and accordingly, the DNA results and the conclusions drawn from the blood samples should not have been admitted into evidence at defendant’s trial; however, the error was deemed harmless due to the overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Errors in the spelling of the victim’s name in a complaint and warrant for kidnapping and alleging that the offense took place at a town other than that shown by evidence at the trial were not prejudicial where the defendant was subsequently indicted by the grand jury and trial was on such indictment. Burke v. Langlois, 104 R.I. 391, 244 A.2d 593, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 659 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1110, 89 S. Ct. 923, 21 L. Ed. 2d 807, 1969 U.S. LEXIS 2690 (1969).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Effect of Jurat.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By executing a jurat at the end of a complaint, a magistrate merely attested to the time, place and person before whom the complaint was sworn in accordance with the mandate of this section. State v. Berker, 120 R.I. 849, 391 A.2d 107, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 733 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Nature of Duties.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not require the justice or clerk to write the complaint with his own hand. State v. Guinness, 16 R.I. 401, 16 A. 910, 1889 R.I. LEXIS 12 (1889).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The duties of a justice of the peace under this section are ministerial, not judicial or quasi-judicial, and require no finding of probable cause. State v. Winsor, 98 R.I. 447, 204 A.2d 427, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 192 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In passing upon the sufficiency of the probable cause shown by a complaint under this section to support the issuance of a warrant thereon, the judge acts judicially and not ministerially and cannot be compelled by mandamus to issue the warrant.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since this section prescribes no judicial or quasi-judicial duties and requires no finding of probable cause, the duties imposed hereunder are purely ministerial and therefore outside the scope of activity circumscribed in Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510, 47 S. Ct. 437, 71 L. Ed. 749 (1927), which held that a defendant is unconstitutionally deprived of his right to due process of law when his liberty or property is subject to the judgment of a court the judge of which has a direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest in reaching a conclusion against him. State v. Berker, 120 R.I. 849, 391 A.2d 107, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 733 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Presumption of Regularity.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Standing to Challenge Judge’s Qualifications.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a complainant could complain that a person had unlawfully impersonated a public officer, plaintiff did not have standing to attack a judge’s qualifications where the judge was acting under color of right in litigation pending in his court.

State v. Roach, 106 R.I. 280, 259 A.2d 119, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 624 (1969).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A peace officer who, in the performance of his duty, makes an arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor that was not committed in his presence, has reasonable grounds to make such an arrest if it was made while assisting a fellow officer in whose presence the misdemeanor in question was committed.

<p class="p7"><b>Construction With § 11-5-5.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Viewed in the light of § 12-7-10, it is clear that the police-assault statute, § 11-5-5, does not abrogate the defendant’s right to defend himself when excessive force is used against him.

<p class="p7"><b>Lawful Resistance — Permissible Force.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When there is evidence tending to show the law-enforcement officer’s use of excessive force, the trial justice must instruct the jury that the force used against the law-enforcement officer was justified provided the defendant limited his assault to the use of reasonable force in defending himself from excessive force.

<p class="p7"><b>Probable Cause.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>At the point when plaintiff took a full arm swing at an officer when the officer attempted to touch plaintiff there could be no probable cause for resisting arrest because there was no reasonable ground upon which plaintiff could have believed officers were attempting to arrest plaintiff.

<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of resisting arrest because the lieutenant testified that a scuffle occurred when the officers attempted to handcuff defendant; and that he and the second officer attempted to get defendant on his stomach to complete the arrest, where the defendant actively combatted the officer’s efforts.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A suspect’s right to a confidential telephone call in the course of a driving while under the influence arrest does not rise to the level of a constitutional right, although it is mandatory that he be informed of his right to the call if he is to enjoy the benefit mandated by this Code section.

<p class="p7"><b>Construction With Other Statutes.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Duty to notify a defendant that bail has been pre-endorsed on his warrant and to provide him with an immediate opportunity to post bail need not be read into either R.I. Dist. Ct. R. Crim. P. 9(a) or R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-13-2. Unlike R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-7-20, where a suspect must be informed of his right to a confidential telephone call in order to exercise it, an arrested person will benefit from the rule requiring prompt presentment whether or not he is aware that it exists; R.I. Dist. Ct. R. Crim. P. 9(a) and R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-13-2 operate as procedural instructions or guidelines that notify the police of the steps that must be taken after they effectuate an arrest. State v. Brown, 898 A.2d 69, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 78 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Harmless Error.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant was not entitled to a dismissal of the charges against him since he made no showing of having suffered any substantial prejudice after the police failed to provide him with a free telephone call, since all the evidence used to convict the defendant had been obtained lawfully before he even arrived at the police barracks; the failure of the police to provide the defendant with the call at that late juncture therefore constituted only harmless error. State v. Veltri, 764 A.2d 163, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 18 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Right to Confidentiality Did Not Attach.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While defendant was “arrested” as contemplated by § 12-7-20 and entitled to the protections afforded by the statute, the statute was not violated where the only evidence adduced concerning the nature of defendant’s telephone calls was an officer’s testimony that defendant called his friend that was coming to get him and his girlfriend who wouldn’t answer, and defendant did not present any evidence to show that the purpose of his telephone calls was to secure or to talk to an attorney; thus, the confidentiality requirement of § 12-7-20 did not attach. State v. Quattrucci, 39 A.3d 1036, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 24 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Scope of Right.</b></p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Subject to any other provisions of law relative to the filing of complaints for particular crimes, any judge of the district court or superior court may place on file any complaint in a criminal case other than a complaint for the commission of a felony or a complaint against a person who has been convicted of a felony or a private complaint. The court may in its discretion require, as a condition of the filing, the performance of services for the public good or may attach any other conditions to it that the court shall determine; provided, in cases where the court ordered restitution totals less than two hundred dollars ($200) to an injured party pursuant to this section or § 12-19-34, the court shall require that full restitution be made at the time of sentencing if the court determines that the defendant has the present ability to make the restitution.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Express conditions of any filing in accordance with this section shall be that the defendant at all times during the one year keep the peace and be of good behavior and shall have paid all outstanding court-imposed or court-related fees, fines, costs, assessments, charges, and/or any other monetary obligations unless reduced or waived by order of the court. A violation of any condition set by the court may be deemed a violation of the filing and the matter that was filed may be resurrected by the court, or the court may impose a sanction. A determination of whether a violation has occurred shall be made by the court in accordance with the procedures relating to a violation of probation, §§ 12-19-9 and 12-19-14.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> In the event the complaint was originally filed under this section subsequent to the defendant’s plea of guilty or nolo contendere to the charges, the court, if it finds there to have been a violation but does not impose a sanction, may sentence the defendant. In the event the court filed the complaint under this section while the defendant maintained a plea of not guilty, if the court finds there to have been a violation but does not impose a sanction, it may proceed to the further disposition of the complaint according to law. If no action is taken on the complaint for a period of one year following the filing, the complaint shall be automatically expunged. No criminal record shall result; provided, that in any civil action for a tort, a plea of guilty or a finding of guilty should be admissible notwithstanding the fact that the complaint has been filed.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, in the event a complaint for a crime involving domestic violence was originally filed under this section subsequent to the defendant’s plea of guilty or nolo contendere to the charges, the court, if it finds there to have been a violation, may sentence the defendant. In the event the court filed the complaint for a crime involving domestic violence under this section while the defendant maintained a plea of not guilty, if the court finds there to have been a violation, it may proceed to the further disposition of the complaint for a crime involving domestic violence according to law. If, for a period of one year after the date of filing, the defendant is not charged with a violation pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the filed complaint for the crime involving domestic violence shall be automatically quashed and shall not be resurrected. If, for a period of three (3) years after the date of filing, the defendant is not charged with a crime involving domestic violence, or if so charged, is acquitted or the complaint is dismissed, all records relating to the filed complaint for a crime involving domestic violence shall be expunged without the requirement of filing a motion pursuant to chapter 1.3 of title 12. No criminal records shall result, unless in any civil action for a tort, in which a plea of guilty or a finding of guilty is admissible notwithstanding the fact that the complaint has been filed. Provided, however, that in sentencing a defendant for a crime involving domestic violence of which the defendant was charged within three (3) years after the filing of a prior crime involving domestic violence to which the defendant pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, the court may take the plea into consideration.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The defendant shall be advised that any and all bail money relating to a case that remains on deposit and is not claimed at the time of expungement shall be escheated to the state’s general treasury in accordance with chapter 12 of title 8.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is a codification of the well settled principle that the language of a complaint must be phrased so as to give a defendant adequate notice of the offense with which he is charged. State v. Hendershot, 415 A.2d 1047, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1650 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a permissible practice, charging defendant with two separate counts of first-degree robbery is not the ideal manner in which to draft an indictment, and the rules are intended to discourage that practice; the preferable manner is to charge a single offense as one count, setting forth multiple theories that may be alleged. State v. Matthews, 88 A.3d 375, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Joinder of Counts.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An indictment which charges the same offense in two different counts is not defective. State v. Doyle, 15 R.I. 527, 9 A. 900, 1887 R.I. LEXIS 35 (1887).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Marital Status.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Though marital status need not be shown, an erroneous description of the defendant’s status is ground for abatement. State v. Daly, 14 R.I. 510, 1884 R.I. LEXIS 42 (1884).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Specific Offenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Murder.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that defendant’s indictment referred to § 11-23-1 and stated that he “did murder” was constitutionally sufficient to give notice to him of a pending charge for first degree murder based on a premeditation theory. State v. Lanigan, 528 A.2d 310, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 520 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Specificity of Counts Alleging Multiple Offenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, in an indictment charging various counts of sexual assault and child molestation, it was not clear whether the defendant was charged with a single act or multiple acts in each count, and a bill of particulars did not clarify, but affirmed the duplicity in some of the counts, convictions returned on the latter counts were vacated. State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 233 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Charge.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Complaint, which charged defendant with taking shellfish “from a polluted area” in violation of former §§ 21-14-4 — 21-14-8 was not subject to demurrer, since it was clear that the words “from a polluted area” were used in the sense appearing in the statute. State v. Merritt, 84 R.I. 313, 124 A.2d 540, 1956 R.I. LEXIS 72 (1956).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the language of the complaint is sufficient to inform the defendant of the offense with which he is charged, the complaint is not demurrable. State v. McGuire, 90 R.I. 191, 156 A.2d 496, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 135 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the complaint in no manner disclosed whether the unreasonable operation with which the defendant was charged was in excess of the speed limits provided in § 31-14-2 or resulted from a failure to reduce speed in the face of one of the hazards provided for in § 31-14-3, it was obviously so vague and indefinite as to be violative of the Rhode Island Const. art. 1, § 10 and not within the contemplation of this section and must be dismissed. State v. Brown, 97 R.I. 115, 196 A.2d 133, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 131 (1963).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the statute required a pharmacist to retain certain records with reference to the purchase of certain drugs for a specified time, an indictment charging him with failure to keep such records was sufficient. State v. Reardon, 101 R.I. 18, 219 A.2d 767, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 344 (1966).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Complaint.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A complaint charging defendant by using the name given to the offense by statute and by further specifically referring to the statute fully complied with the requirements of this section as well as with state and federal constitutional requirements. State v. Tweedie, 444 A.2d 855, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 850 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Use of Technical Terms.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If the indictment charges an offense known to the common law in technical words which admit of but one meaning, the defendant’s constitutional guaranty is fully satisfied. State v. Domanski, 57 R.I. 500, 190 A. 854, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 128 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Waiver of Defect.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant by entering a plea waived a misnomer in the complaint. State v. Drury, 13 R.I. 540, 1882 R.I. LEXIS 37 (1882); State v. O'Brien, 18 R.I. 105, 25 A. 910, 1892 R.I. LEXIS 21 (1892).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Location of Offense.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant moved to quash the indictment on the ground there was a variance between the indictment charging the defendant with a murder committed in Providence County and the proof relied upon which showed only that he took part in the beatings inflicted upon the decedent in Bristol County, the discrepancy between the averment and proof did not affect defendant’s substantial rights and, in order to be considered, such objections must be raised with clarity and particularity in the court below. State v. Harris, 111 R.I. 147, 300 A.2d 267, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1189, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1008, 94 S. Ct. 369, 38 L. Ed. 2d 245, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 1300 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Misnomer.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An indictment cannot be amended to change the first name of the person against whom the crime was committed unless the defendant consents to the amendment or unless it is made in the presence of and with the concurrence of the grand jury. State v. McCarty, 17 R.I. 370, 22 A. 282, 1891 R.I. LEXIS 34 (1891).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>No Prejudice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to dismiss the conspiracy charge where defendant was aware that the State intended to offer evidence of his involvement with another around a certain time and was not subjected to any surprise or prejudice from the evidence introduced at trial.

Gen. Laws § 12-12-17 excepted child molestation from that statute of limitations. Brown v. State, 32 A.3d 901, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 142 (R.I. 2011).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The version of R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-12-22 as amended in 2000, which allowed for vacation of guilty pleas entered in the absence of an advisement regarding possible immigration repercussions, did not apply retroactively to defendant, who pled nolo contendere a few days before the statute took effect; since defendant believed defendant’s mother’s naturalization had made defendant a citizen, the trial justice was under no duty to inquire further, and defendant was not entitled to post-conviction relief from the plea. Tavarez v. State, 826 A.2d 941, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 59 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Federal habeas petitioner could not have reasonably relied upon the availability of discretionary relief at the time he pleaded guilty to a second aggravated felony in a Rhode Island state court in 1994, given the advisement under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-12-22(b) of potential immigration consequences, including deportation that petitioner could face. Melo v. Ashcroft, 364 F. Supp. 2d 183, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6429 (D.R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-12-22(b) requires trial courts to advise defendants of the immigration consequences of a plea of nolo contendere, it was enacted years after defendant’s conviction and is not applied retroactively. And as defendant received a fair warning that his plea could have immigration consequences, his plea was voluntary and intelligent. Moniz v. State, 933 A.2d 691, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 100 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Case on appeal in which defendant challenged the denial of her suppression motion was remanded because of concern that defendant’s stipulation to the evidence on record and her waiver of her right to a jury trial were actually a conditional plea, which was not recognized by R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 11 and which would not have preserved for appeal the denial of the motion to suppress; among other things, the trial court had informed defendant of the possible consequences to her immigration status as a result of her case’s disposition, which was an admonition required by statute for entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere. The trial court was instructed to make findings and a determination of whether there was an agreed-upon disposition in exchange for a waiver of a jury trial. State v. Paiva, 967 A.2d 1103, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 35 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Collateral Consequences.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no duty to inform alien defendants of the collateral consequence of possible or certain deportation. State v. Figueroa, 639 A.2d 495, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not impose on the trial court the duty of informing a defendant that pleas of guilty or nolo contendere may have immigration effects.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was properly denied post-conviction relief after pleading nolo contendere to two crimes and not being advised of possible immigration consequences because the version of the statute that was in effect at the time of the plea applied and under that version, there was no duty to inform defendant of the collateral consequence of possible or certain deportation. Gomez v. State, 816 A.2d 1277, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 42 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court admonishments given to a defendant and his counsel when defendant pled nolo contendere that deportation was a possibility were not in substantial compliance with the clear mandate of R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-12-22, as amended by R.I. Pub. Laws ch. 501, § 1, as they failed to convey that the plea could have three very serious and specific immigration implications. Machado v. State, 839 A.2d 509, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 208 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure of counsel to inform a convict that a guilty plea could result in deportation did not violate the amendment to R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-12-22 as: (1) the amendment was effective more than six years after the convict’s plea, and it was not retroactive; (2) under the previous law, the convict did not have to be advised of the possibility of deportation; and (3) the convict admitted that the convict read and understood the Spanish language version of the plea form, which clearly warned the convict about the possible immigration consequences of a plea. Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 149 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Notice Held Sufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where two defendants were made aware that possible immigration consequences could result from their pleas of nolo contendere: one by an immigration paragraph contained in the Spanish plea form, the other by his attorney, the requirement of this section was met in both actions. State v. Figueroa, 639 A.2d 495, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Post-conviction relief was properly denied to an applicant who was a resident alien who claimed that the trial court had erred in not telling him of his right to additional time to consider his nolo contendere plea and that the plea forms he signed should have contained the statutory warnings from R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-12-22(b) of the possible immigration consequences of his plea; the statute did not require that such warnings had to appear on the plea forms. Dossantos v. State, 897 A.2d 39, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 73 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the postconviction relief applicant’s plea of nolo contendere was accepted after the justice gave only one part of the tripartite immigration warnings required to be given under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-12-22(b), the justice appropriately and timely rectified the mistake. The justice readdressed the applicant before the applicant left the courtroom and reviewed with the applicant all three of the immigration consequences as required by statute; although the justice did not vacate the original plea, the justice had the prosecutor reread the facts that the prosecution was to attempt to prove at trial; the justice elicited from the applicant an admission that the facts were correct, at which point the justice again found that the applicant knowingly and voluntarily had entered a plea; and the record did not indicate that the applicant asked for any additional time to consider the plea, but instead stated that he understood the consequences of the plea and how it might affect the his immigration status. Asare v. State, 945 A.2d 300, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 45 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As there was sufficient evidence on the record that petitioner inmate was informed by his counsel and by the trial court about the possibility of deportation pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-12-22, the inmate’s claim in his postconviction relief application of ineffective assistance of counsel, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI, lacked merit. Neufville v. State, 13 A.3d 607, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 13 (R.I. 2011).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Bail Revocation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a court with jurisdiction over a criminal case has the power to enforce its orders, it has inherent authority to revoke bail upon breach of a bail condition, and this action does not constitute preventive detention. Mello v. Superior Court, 117 R.I. 578, 370 A.2d 1262, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1729 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s conduct in trespassing upon a family court justice’s property in order to discuss a divorce controversy being litigated before the justice constituted a violation of the statutory condition for release on bail that the accused must “in the meantime keep the peace and be of good behavior”.

<p class="p7"><b>— Hearing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a defendant facing bail revocation is jeopardized at least as much as one facing revocation of parole, or probation, or imposition of sentence for breach of a deferred sentence agreement, the rights afforded defendants in those situations must attach to a defendant in a bail revocation proceeding. Mello v. Superior Court, 117 R.I. 578, 370 A.2d 1262, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1729 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The requirements of due process apply to bail revocation proceedings, therefore, a defendant awaiting a revocation hearing has the right to a speedy determination of his status. Mello v. Superior Court, 117 R.I. 578, 370 A.2d 1262, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1729 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A bail revocation hearing must be conducted with the same promptness as the hearing which follows state opposition to the granting of bail; a two-week delay in the bail revocation hearing is clearly unlawful. Mello v. Superior Court, 117 R.I. 578, 370 A.2d 1262, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1729 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The standard of proof applicable in bail revocation hearings is that evidence must “reasonably satisfy that there had been a violation”; thus the standard of proof requires the state to go beyond probable cause and affords a defendant the necessary due process.

Defendant had been in custody only 30 minutes before he began speaking to officers; his statement was not induced by the failure to present him to someone authorized to take bail within that 30 minutes; and the statute and the rule did not impose upon police an affirmative duty to notify an arrested person of his right to post pre-endorsed bail and obtain release.

<p class="p6">Whenever in any criminal case a defendant is required to recognize with surety or sureties, or has given a recognizance in the case, any justice of the district court, when the complaint is pending in the court or the person is held to answer to the court, or any justice of the superior court, may, on motion of the attorney general, require the defendant to be brought before the justice to show cause why he or she should not be required to give a new recognizance with surety or sureties in place of the one already required or given, and the justice in his or her discretion, if good cause is shown, may require the defendant to give in place of the recognizance already given or required a new recognizance in the same sum as that originally required or given with other and sufficient surety or sureties, or to give a new recognizance with surety or sureties in a different sum than that originally required or given, as to the justice may seem reasonable, to do and to perform the conditions of the recognizance already given or required. In case the defendant shall fail to give the new recognizance required of him or her, the defendant shall immediately be committed to the penal institution to which he or she would have been committed if he or she had failed to give the recognizance originally required there to remain until he or she shall give the new recognizance as required of him or her before some justice or person authorized to take it, or until he or she shall be discharged pursuant to law.</p>

<p class="p6">Every person who seeks the services of the office of the public defender under this chapter must make affidavit under oath that, after payment of necessary expenses for food, shelter and medical care, he or she does not have sufficient income or assets to enable him or her to retain counsel, nor is there any one to whom he or she is entitled to look for support who has that income or assets. The public defender, on his or her own instigation or at the request of a referring court, may require a further financial statement, may require relevant documents, and may conduct any investigation he or she deems appropriate. If the public defender, after examination and investigation of the financial statement, is satisfied that the person submitting it is an indigent defendant, the public defender or one of his or her assistants shall defend the person; provided, that if the public defender is satisfied that the person is not an indigent defendant, he or she shall notify the court which referred the person to the public defender’s office of the determination that the person is not an indigent defendant.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in finding that defendant voluntarily waived counsel without the trial court first independently inquiring into defendant’s indigency status, after the Public Defender’s office had found him ineligible; defendant continuously said he had funds to hire counsel, even after claiming he was indigent but was deemed ineligible for Public Defender representation, and R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-15-9, which defines eligibility requirements for indigent representation, does not expressly mandate or permit a trial justice to review the Public Defender’s finding of ineligibility. Moreover, defendant’s continuous failure to obtain representation demonstrated a voluntary waiver of counsel. State v. Souto, 210 A.3d 409, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 96 (R.I. 2019).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>On appeal to the superior court the statutes require and provide for a trial de novo of the cause in its entirety.

<p class="p7"><b>Venue.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the defendant contended that the superior court of Providence County lacked jurisdiction to try him for acts allegedly committed in Bristol County, this section provided that evidence that an offense had been committed either in Providence or Bristol County was available as proof under an indictment stating the venue as being in the county of Providence.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To the extent that the valid exercise of the superior court’s subject matter jurisdiction is dependent on a factual determination of where the crime occurred, the trial justice may await the full development of the state’s evidence before ruling on a motion to dismiss.

<p class="p7"><b>Knowing Waiver.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was not error to grant defendant’s motion for trial without a jury where such motion was made through his attorney, who informed the court that he had fully advised the defendant of his rights, and, in response to questions by the court, the defendant stated that he understood that the court rather than a jury would hear the evidence and decide all questions, that that was his choice and desire, and that no promises or rewards had been made to induce such choice. State v. Franklin, 103 R.I. 715, 241 A.2d 219, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 854 (1968), overruled in part, State v. Aurgemma, 116 R.I. 425, 358 A.2d 46, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1291 (1976).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section merely affirms the common-law rule that when an indictment charges an offense that includes within it another lesser offense, it is sufficient to prove so much of the charge as demonstrates that the accused is guilty of a crime therein contained, although not to the full extent charged against him. As a result, defendant is charged with the knowledge that an accusation of the greater crime carries with it the charge that he has committed all the necessarily included lesser offenses that are part of the greater crime.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s judgment of conviction for criminal solicitation of murder had to be vacated, as the undisputed evidence showed that the intended recipient of the solicitation never received the soliciting instrument, a letter defendant sent from jail; as a result, the case had to be remanded to the trial court so defendant could be tried on a lesser charge of attempted criminal solicitation of murder in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-1-9 and § 12-17-14. State v. Andujar, 899 A.2d 1209, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 83 (R.I. 2006).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Each count of the petition charging defendant minor with first-degree child molestation necessarily included a charge on the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation. There was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the contact between defendant and his victims could be reasonably construed as intended by defendant to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault. In re B.H., 138 A.3d 774, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Instructions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where trial judge pointed out to the jury that under this section if they found defendant not guilty of either degree of murder they could still find him guilty of manslaughter and he then charged that manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice expressed or implied and without premeditation, he also charged that if the jury found that death resulted from an accident as claimed by defendant they would have to acquit him but if they found that the state had proved that defendant without premeditation or malice aforethought did deliver the fatal blow or blows resulting in the child’s death their verdict must be guilty of manslaughter, such charges were correct as applied to the evidence. State v. Crough, 89 R.I. 338, 152 A.2d 644, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 86 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where indictments charged defendant with possession of cannabis and cocaine with intent to deliver, in order to be found guilty of these charges, one element that had to be proven was possession of the controlled substances; therefore it was not error to charge the jury regarding the lesser-included crime of possession. State v. Sundel, 121 R.I. 638, 402 A.2d 585, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2043 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If trial counsel for the defendant believes that the evidence warrants a second degree murder instruction because the defendant acted in a wanton and reckless manner or in the course of an inherently dangerous felony, he should request a specific instruction regarding these theories of second degree murder. Trial counsel’s failure to make such a request precludes the Supreme Court from considering a challenge to the trial justice’s refusal to give a second degree murder instruction. State v. Tarvis, 465 A.2d 164, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1076 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the state charges the defendant with two counts of assault with intent to murder in violation of § 11-5-1, which statute requires only that the intent to murder be accompanied by some type of assault, and it is undisputed that the defendant effectuated the assault with a gun, the court acts correctly when it instructs the jury on the lesser included offense of assault with a dangerous weapon. State v. Dordain, 566 A.2d 942, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 160 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The evidence did not warrant a lesser-included offense jury instruction, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-17-14 and R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 31(c) on second-degree murder, since there was not even minimal evidence that would justify a conviction on a offense of second-degree murder and it was evident that premeditation existed for more than a mere moment. State v. Rodriguez, 822 A.2d 894, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 113 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Both R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-17-14 and R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 31(c) serve to place a defendant on notice of all lesser-included offenses necessarily included in the stated charge; although only a minimal quantum of relevant evidence is necessary for a lesser-included offense to go to the jury, a trial justice is not required to instruct the jury on such an offense when the evidence adduced at trial shows no dispute as to an essential element that distinguishes the greater and the lesser offenses. State v. Rodriguez, 822 A.2d 894, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 113 (R.I. 2003).</p>

The court, in its discretion, after notice to the witness, may order the witness to answer the question or produce the evidence. The witness may not refuse to comply with the order on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination; but the witness shall not be prosecuted or subjected to penalty or forfeiture for, or on account of, any transaction or matter regarding which, in accordance with the order, he or she gave answer or produced evidence and no testimony or other information compelled under the order or any information directly or indirectly derived from the testimony or other information shall be used against the witness in any criminal case, except he or she may be prosecuted or subjected to penalty or forfeiture for any perjury, false swearing, or contempt committed in answering or failing to answer, or in producing or failing to produce evidence, in accordance with the order. No court order directing a witness to answer a question or to produce evidence issued pursuant to this section shall operate to vacate, modify, or otherwise prevent the enforcement of any conviction, judgment, or sentence entered by any court against the witness prior to the grant of immunity, unless the order entered pursuant to this section expressly provides for it.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Conviction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although this section does not affirmatively state that a nolo contendere plea followed by a sentence of imprisonment or a suspended sentence constitutes a conviction, it states that the provision that a nolo contendere plea is not a conviction does not apply when the plea is followed by such a sentence. By implication, this means that a nolo contendere plea followed by a sentence of imprisonment or a suspended sentence constitutes a conviction. United States v. Patrone, 948 F.2d 813, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 26375 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 978, 112 S. Ct. 2953, 119 L. Ed. 2d 575, 1992 U.S. LEXIS 3488 (1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 12-18-3 provides that upon completion of a probationary period subsequent to a nolo contendere plea, the plea and probation shall not constitute a conviction for any purpose, but the statute is silent as to whether a nolo plea followed by probation constitute a conviction while the probationary period still is being served. In re McEnaney, 718 A.2d 920, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 279 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Federal Procedure.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notwithstanding the language of this section, for purposes of federal gun control laws, a plea of nolo contendere followed by a sentence of probation is a “conviction” sufficient to result in a finding of “prohibited person” status. United States v. Cadden, 98 F. Supp. 2d 193, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7094 (D.R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sealing of Records.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>District court erred in denying defendant’s motion pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-1-12.1(a) to seal all records pertaining to her two dismissed misdemeanor arrests because defendant’s plea of nolo contendere did not constitute a conviction for “any purpose” that was unrelated to the original disposition under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-18-3(a) because defendant successfully complied with the conditions of her probationary sentence; nothing in R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 12-1-12 or 12-1-12.1 directs that a plea of nolo contendere followed by probation should be deemed a conviction under those statutory provisions. State v. Poulin, 66 A.3d 419, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 67 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plea of nolo contendere followed by probation would not preclude a defendant from sealing his or her records because in the sealing context, the affected person has been acquitted or exonerated, whereas a person seeking to have his or her records expunged has not; therefore, sealing should be more widely available to those individuals than to those seeking to have their records expunged. State v. Poulin, 66 A.3d 419, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 67 (R.I. 2013).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Purpose of this section is to aid the court in the exercise of its exclusive power to sentence and not to restrict or limit such power. Knowles v. Langlois, 90 R.I. 445, 159 A.2d 616, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 45 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Juveniles.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the family court had waived its jurisdiction over the juvenile who was tried in superior court and sentenced as if he were an adult, the trial justice was entitled to receive the pre-sentence report as provided in this section. Taylor v. Howard, 111 R.I. 527, 304 A.2d 891, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1240 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Mandatory Sentences.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For the reason that the legislature should not be accused of contemplating “an exercise in futility,” it is clear that it intended the requirements for the submission of a presentence report would be operative only in those instances where a judge had discretion in the punishments he could impose and, hence, would not apply to a conviction of murder in the first degree. State v. Bradshaw, 101 R.I. 233, 221 A.2d 815, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 378 (1966).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Presumption of Regularity.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court will assume in the absence of proof to the contrary that in imposing sentence the superior court proceeded according to law. Powers v. Langlois, 90 R.I. 45, 153 A.2d 535, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 109 (1959), cert. denied, 362 U.S. 905, 80 S. Ct. 615, 4 L. Ed. 2d 556, 1960 U.S. LEXIS 1585 (1960); State v.

<p class="p7"><b>Reference to Report at Sentencing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is nothing in the statute requiring the court to make any reference to the presentence report when the defendant is sentenced. Evans v. Langlois, 99 R.I. 320, 207 A.2d 380, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 437 (1965).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Substantial Compliance.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A presentence report dated more than three months prior to sentencing was a substantial compliance with the section although such report contained reference to fact that defendant was bound over to grand jury for breaking and entering but did not show that grand jury failed to return indictment, the latter event occurring after the date of the presentence report.

<p class="p7"><b>Commencement of Probation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section, the grant of authority is broad enough to permit the sentencing justice to fix the time when probationary status shall commence. Gonsalves v. Howard, 113 R.I. 544, 324 A.2d 338, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1209 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a sentence of ten years which was to be served concurrently with two three year terms was suspended and the defendant placed on probation without setting a date for commencement and with the provision that the terms would be served consecutively if the probation was revoked, the period of probation began when the probation order was adopted. Gonsalves v. Howard, 113 R.I. 544, 324 A.2d 338, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1209 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was not error to find an inmate violated probation when serving an unrelated sentence because an implied condition of good behavior attached when the probation sentence was pronounced. Price v. Wall, 31 A.3d 995, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 143 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant was on probation and subject to being adjudged a violator at the time of the 2011 incident, even though the sentencing judge had specified that defendant’s 10-year probationary term would commence on his release from confinement and the Department of Correction had informed defendant by letter that his probation ended in 2009. Because defendant was sentenced to a 30-year term, and the effect of his good-time or time-served credits reduced his period of incarceration but did not reduce the overall length of his sentence, his sentence ended 30 years later, and any suspended or probationary period did not reduce the sentence. State v. Parrillo, 158 A.3d 283, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Concurrent Sentences.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whether two sentences, previously imposed at the same time and the execution of which has been suspended, are to be served concurrently or consecutively if and when such suspension is subsequently revoked, depends on what was intended by the sentencing justice. Pelliccia v. Sharkey, 110 R.I. 319, 292 A.2d 862, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 916 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction With § 12-19-19.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this section, a suspended sentence is actually imposed, but the execution thereof is suspended, but under § 12-19-19 a deferred sentence is never imposed unless the defendant violates his written agreement with the attorney general. State v. Robalewski, 96 R.I. 296, 191 A.2d 148, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 35 (1963).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction With § 12-19-2.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although it appears that this section vests a sentencing court with the authority to fix when the period of a defendant’s probation is to commence, this statute must be read in conjunction with § 12-19-9, which permits revocation of a defendant’s probation whenever the terms and conditions inherent in the very privilege of probation are violated by the defendant. Those inherent terms and conditions, one of which is the implied condition of good behavior, come into existence at the very moment that a sentence that includes probation is imposed and remain until the termination of the full sentence period. State v. Dantzler, 690 A.2d 338, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 71 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Length of a probationer’s sentence was not miscalculated because the probationer’s credits for good conduct and participation in institutional industries, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-24, and for time served awaiting disposition, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-19-2(a), did not entitle the probationer to an acceleration of the end date of the probationer’s probationary term. Rose v. State, 92 A.3d 903, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 20 (R.I. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Home Confinement.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A defendant’s confinement in the home must be termed a condition of probation so as not to violate § 12-19-23. State v. Paster, 524 A.2d 587, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 465 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A trial justice does not abuse his or her discretion by sentencing a nondangerous defendant to home confinement as a condition of probation provided the trial justice incorporates a reasonable, practical plan for supervision and provides specific sanctions for violations of such supervision as part of the sentence.

<p class="p7"><b>Additional Probationary Period.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An additional probationary period may not be imposed after a defendant who violated his probation is forced to serve the sentence previously imposed. State v. Taylor, 473 A.2d 290, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 483 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An agreement cannot be made to extend a defendant’s probation period beyond that which was originally imposed by the sentencing court in order to give him more time in which to pay restitution. Consequently, when the period of probation had expired prior to the time when the defendant entered into such an agreement, was unable to fulfill the restitution, and received a probation-violation notice, the court erred in then adjudging the defendant a violator. The defendant’s duty to fulfill his obligation regarding restitution, however, was not vitiated and he remained civilly liable therefor. State v. Traudt, 679 A.2d 330, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 197 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court exceeded its statutory authority in imposing two additional years of probation upon the defendant, who had violated his probation and who was ordered to serve a portion of the sentence previously imposed. State v. Chabot, 682 A.2d 1377, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 233 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Allocution.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was error where the hearing justice failed to grant the defendant or defense counsel the opportunity to present argument concerning the amount of punishment, or to present any factors that might be considered in mitigation of the imposition of consecutive sentences, but instead adjudged the defendant a probation violator and abruptly terminated the proceeding after hearing several witnesses and rejecting defense counsel’s argument that the state failed to prove its case. State v. Ratchford, 732 A.2d 120, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 157 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court satisfied the requirements of both R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 32(f) and R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-19-9 as it allowed defendant’s counsel to address the court before deciding whether defendant violated the terms of his probation. State v. Jones, 969 A.2d 676, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 52 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>After revoking defendant’s probation, the trial court did not err in failing to allow him or his defense counsel to address the court before sentencing, as allocution was not required prior to sentencing in a probation-violation case in which consecutive sentences are not imposed or a sentence on more than one case is not levied. State v. Delarosa, 39 A.3d 1043, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 33 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Concurrent Sentences.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whether two sentences, previously imposed at the same time and the execution of which has been suspended, are to be served concurrently or consecutively if and when such suspension is subsequently revoked, depends on what was intended by the sentencing justice. Pelliccia v. Sharkey, 110 R.I. 319, 292 A.2d 862, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 916 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whether a sentencing justice imposes several sentences at the same time or is aware of prior sentences imposed by another justice, he or she is in the position to exercise the choice of imposing consecutive or concurrent sentences and that choice is thereafter binding upon the justice who later revokes the suspension of such sentences. State v. Studman, 468 A.2d 918, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1122 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A probation-violation court has the power to reinstate a previously suspended sentence and order it to run consecutively to a sentence imposed by another jurisdiction, such as a sentence imposed in federal court. State v. DeLuca, 692 A.2d 689, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 81 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction With § 12-19-8.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although it appears that § 12-19-8 vests a sentencing court with the authority to fix when the period of a defendant’s probation is to commence, that statute must be read in conjunction with this section, which permits revocation of a defendant’s probation whenever the terms and conditions inherent in the very privilege of probation are violated by the defendant. Those inherent terms and conditions, one of which is the implied condition of good behavior, come into existence at the very moment that a sentence that includes probation is imposed and remain until the termination of the full sentence period. State v. Dantzler, 690 A.2d 338, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 71 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Counsel.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because defendant was offered the choice to continue with the appointed counsel or self-representation, because there were no exceptional circumstances justifying the postponement of defendant’s probation violation hearing, because the grounds for defendant’s request did not call into doubt counsel’s capability to adequately represent defendant, because no other competent and prepared trial counsel was ready to pinch-hit, and because defendant did not believe defendant could self-represent, the hearing justice did not err in refusing defendant’s request for the appointment of alternate counsel. State v. Gilbert, 984 A.2d 26, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 136 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Discretion of Court.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where petitioner’s probation was conditioned upon not engaging in any antisocial conduct which would furnish cause for a court to believe probation order should be revoked in public interest, and petitioner was later charged with breaking and entering which was then dismissed after granting of motion to suppress evidence, revocation of probation was not arbitrarily or capriciously determined by the court. Charest v. Howard, 109 R.I. 360, 285 A.2d 381, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 1194 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In Supreme Court review of the trial justice’s decision to vacate suspension, defendant is limited to a consideration of whether or not the justice acted arbitrarily or capriciously. State v. Studman, 121 R.I. 766, 402 A.2d 1185, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2054 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where it was very clear that the trial justice did not believe the defendant’s version regarding virtually every aspect of an incident in which the defendant entered the victim’s home with an ice pick and stabbed him seven times in the back, although the defendant was acquitted on charges arising out of the stabbing, the trial justice did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in denying the defendant’s motion to vacate the revocation of his probation. State v. Goddu, 638 A.2d 62 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in rejecting the testimony of certain witnesses and in determining that, despite factual inconsistencies, there existed reasonably satisfactory evidence to support a finding that defendant had violated the terms of his probation. State v. Kennedy, 702 A.2d 28, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 277 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Through the use of the term “may” and “as to the court may seem just and proper,” the legislature intended that a violation-hearing justice would have considerable discretion in selecting which of the options provided for he would apply to a probation violator and in deciding how those options would be applied. State v. Tucker, 747 A.2d 451, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 53 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A violation-hearing justice acted well within his authority when he ordered a continuation of the defendant’s remaining suspended sentence after he adjudged the defendant to be a probation violator and ordered him to serve a portion of his original suspended sentence in prison. State v. Tucker, 747 A.2d 451, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 53 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In revoking defendant’s probation, trial court satisfied both R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-19-9 and R.I. Super Ct. R. Crim. P. 32(f) where defendant’s counsel was provided an opportunity to address the hearing justice before his decision on whether defendant had violated the terms and conditions of his probation; no error was committed, therefore, by ordering the suspension of sentence to be lifted and the sentence to be served on a single felony case. State v. Nania, 786 A.2d 1066, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 254 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly found that defendant had violated the terms of his probation pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-19-9; the trial justice properly determined that the testimony of a police officer who observed defendant involved in a robbery was more credible than testimony of defendant’s alibi witness, his girlfriend, and the trial justice properly rejected defendant’s argument that any lack of fingerprint evidence would be exculpatory. State v. Beverly, 822 A.2d 170, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 117 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once defendant was apprehended and the warrant was cancelled, it was incumbent upon the State to move on a probation violation hearing within a reasonable time; as the trial court was not precluded pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-19-9 from setting bail and scheduling a violation hearing within a reasonable amount of time. State v. Tavares, 837 A.2d 730, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 233 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a hearing justice’s finding of a probation violation turned on a determination of the credibility of the State’s three witnesses, the ultimate disposition of defendant’s underlying convictions were immaterial to a review of the hearing justice’s decision under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 32(f), that defendant failed to keep the peace. State v. DiChristofaro, 842 A.2d 1075, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 45 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s assertion that he had been of good behavior from 1995, when his probation was initially imposed, until he violated his probation in 2001 did not prevent the hearing justice from imposing the full original sentence; the hearing justice acted well within his discretion. State v. Vieira, 883 A.2d 1146, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 193 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the complainants did not describe a probationer with exacting precision, a hearing justice found that they had made good identifications and that a photo array was not unduly suggestive; therefore, the justice properly determined that the probationer violated the terms of probation, and imposed a previously suspended sentence. State v. Wray, 919 A.2d 414, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 23 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a hearing justice acted neither arbitrarily nor capriciously in assessing witness credibility regarding a burglary that took place while defendant was on probation, defendant was properly found to be in violation of the terms and conditions of defendant’s probation. State v. Horton, 971 A.2d 606, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 63 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because there were no exceptional circumstances that called for an eleventh-hour discharge of counsel, because defendant failed to keep the peace and remain on good behavior while on probation, and because defendant’s sentence was based on the nature of the first offense, pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 32(f) and R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-19-9, defendant’s probation was properly revoked. State v. Lancellotta, 35 A.3d 863, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 1 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a probation violation hearing relating to a charge that defendant committed assault or battery while he was on probation, the hearing justice did not err in deciding to credit the testimony of the State’s witnesses rather than the testimony of defendant’s witnesses, in that it was reasonable for the hearing justice to give a lesser weight to the testimony of an eyewitness, who admitted that he had poor eyesight and who denied ever seeing defendant, from his vantage point across the street, strike the complaining witness. State v. Jackson, 966 A.2d 1225, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 30 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a trial court found three witnesses to be credible because they shared the same description of the events that transpired and it found defendant’s testimony to be “one complete lie” that in no way refuted the testimony of the other witnesses, the trial court did not act arbitrarily or capriciously when it found that defendant violated the terms and conditions of his probation. State v. Jones, 969 A.2d 676, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 52 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though a hearing justice added a previously undisclosed fingerprint to the evidentiary scale, the hearing officer had sufficient evidence to conclude that defendant, by defendant’s own admission, was the intruder shown on a store’s surveillance tapes; accordingly, the hearing officer’s probation violation ruling was neither arbitrary nor capricious. State v. Tetreault, 973 A.2d 489, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s probation was properly revoked, as the trial court’s findings that a complainant was credible despite some inconsistencies in her testimony, and that defendant had committed an assault and battery and an assault upon her, supported its determination that he did not keep the peace and was not of good behavior. State v. Shepard, 33 A.3d 158, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 154 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a probation violation proceeding, the trial court did not err by crediting an accomplice’s testimony simply because she was offered a favorable plea bargain to testify against defendant, as it found that many details she provided were corroborated by testimony of the victims, and her credibility assessments were entitled to deference. State v. Delarosa, 39 A.3d 1043, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 33 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in finding that defendant violated the terms of his probation because the trial justice carefully weighed the evidence and found the complaining witness’s testimony to be candid, credible, and corroborated by other evidence, notwithstanding some disparities, and found the testimony of defendant’s girlfriend to be biased. State v. Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d 45, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 56 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Hearing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The language of the statute providing for “the presence of the defendant” in open court does not require that he be confronted by witnesses against him as in a trial upon a criminal charge. Nor was he entitled to demand as of right that the information upon which the trial justice based his revocation of suspension should conform to the established rules of evidence. Harris v. Langlois, 98 R.I. 387, 202 A.2d 288, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 180, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 866, 85 S. Ct. 138, 13 L. Ed. 2d 70, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 774 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence at a revocation hearing that the defendant, while on probation, had sold thorazine to a federal narcotics agent on the representation that it was heroin and had subsequently sold heroin to such agent justified the superior court in revoking defendant’s suspension of sentence and committing him to serve the sentence previously imposed. Walker v. Langlois, 104 R.I. 274, 243 A.2d 733, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 645 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state must either hold violation of probation hearings and violation of deferred sentencing agreement hearings (see § 12-19-19) first and give the alleged violator use and derivative use immunity for any testimony he may give, or postpone the violation hearing until after the criminal trial; this rule was given prospective effect only. State v. DeLomba, 117 R.I. 673, 370 A.2d 1273, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1738 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Neither due process nor policy requires that the hearing to determine whether the defendant has violated probation or a deferred sentencing agreement (§ 12-19-19) by committing a crime be split into a probable cause hearing at the time of arrest and a final hearing following the criminal proceedings. State v. DeLomba, 117 R.I. 673, 370 A.2d 1273, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1738 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A hearing on violation of probation could not be held in the absence of the person on probation irrespective of whether such absence was voluntary or involuntary. State v. Arroyo, 121 R.I. 877, 403 A.2d 1086, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2035 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>At the violation hearing the state is not required to prove the violation beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, the trial justice need only be reasonably satisfied that there has been a violation. Accordingly, acquittal on the underlying offense does not automatically preclude a violation. State v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, in accordance with R.I. Gen.

LEXIS 147 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the hearing justice failed to conduct a threshold inquiry into whether the State had good cause for denying defendant the opportunity to confront anyone with personal knowledge of his probationary record in Massachusetts and failed to analyze the reliability of the State’s substitute evidence, the hearing justice committed reversible error by erroneously admitting the hearsay testimony. State v. Bernard, 925 A.2d 936, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 84 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because defendant failed to offer proof concerning the complainant’s expected testimony, failed to show that the complainant’s testimony would have been material, and failed to provide any facts demonstrating that defendant had been diligent in seeking to secure the complainant, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a continuance. State v. Gilbert, 984 A.2d 26, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 136 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a witness revealed her second encounter with defendant for the first time at the probation violation hearing, because there was no written or recorded version of that statement, the trial court did not err in finding that the State did not violate defendant’s discovery rights under R.I.

<p class="p7"><b>Held Without Bail.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the reason the defendant was held more than 10 days without bail was his failed attempt to obtain private counsel and also the fact his public defender was unavailable to begin the hearing, the defendant clearly contributed to the delay and thus there is not violation of this section in this case. State v. LeBlanc, 687 A.2d 456, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 17 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err by denying defendant’s motion to dismiss because of the delay in his probation violation hearing; given the nature and extent of defendant’s conduct in contributing to the delay, he could not complain that he was held without bail without a hearing past the 10-day period prescribed in this section, as the initial continuance extending the case beyond the 10-day period was granted at defendant’s request and there was a continuance granted by agreement after the State made an offer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>State v. Molina, 251 A.3d 485, 2021 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. 2021).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Implied Condition of Good Behavior.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No due process violation occurred when trial court revoked defendant’s probation while he was on escaped status from a correction institution because § 12-19-9 served to put the defendant on notice that his probation could be revoked at any time whenever he violated any term or condition of his probation; despite the fact that the trial court specifically stated that the defendant’s probationary term was to commence upon his official release from prison, the defendant was subject to, as part of his probationary sentence, an implied condition of good behavior that attached to the total length of his sentence at the time sentence was imposed. State v. Dantzler, 690 A.2d 338, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 71 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s aggressive conduct during an altercation with a victim, particularly his shoving the victim, was not in accordance with the good behavior expected of a person on probation; thus, sufficient evidence existed to support the trial court’s finding that defendant had engaged in aggressive conduct in violation of the terms and conditions of his probation. State v. House, 889 A.2d 231, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 221 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the trial court considered the evidence presented and determined that the first complainant was a credible witness and that defendant admitted he provided alcohol to both complainants who he then had sex with while they were too intoxicated to resist, it hardly acted arbitrarily in concluding that defendant violated his probation as his conduct lacked the required good behavior expected and required by his probationary status. State v. Maciorski, 889 A.2d 699, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 204 (R.I. 2005).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s probation violation was properly found because (1) a failure to keep the peace and remain of good behavior did not have to be criminal, and (2) defendant’s acts were found to be sufficiently related to defendant’s prior sexual misconduct. State v. Brown, 140 A.3d 768, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A trial justice has jurisdiction to revoke a parolee’s probation for acts committed after a sentence has been imposed but prior to the expiration of the parole period. State v. Jacques, 544 A.2d 193 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the defendant, who was on probation and serving a suspended sentence, was adjudged a violator of the terms of his sentence and was ordered to serve six months, the trial court did not mention the remaining three and one-half years of the suspended sentence. In a subsequent adjudication, the second trial court properly imposed the remainder of the original sentence since the first trial court at the violation hearing did not possess the statutory power to amend or decrease the sentence as originally imposed and was bound by the terms of that sentence. State v. Heath, 659 A.2d 116, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 156 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Report of Conduct.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In view of defendant’s misconduct over a lengthy period of time while on probation, the trial justice, in removing the suspension of sentence order without first obtaining the conduct report did not abuse his judicial discretion. State v. Sousa, 116 R.I. 411, 358 A.2d 44, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1289 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The hearing justice did not err in allowing the state to amend an error in the report under this rule at a probation hearing since the amendment in no way prejudiced the defendant and such a hearing is civil in nature. State v. Barber, 767 A.2d 78, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 71 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sentence for Violation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the defendant had over four years remaining in his original five year sentence at the time of his violation, the trial justice was within his authority to order that the defendant serve six months of the remaining sentence, the other four years to be suspended with probation.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Hearing justice has considerable latitude in deciding whether a probation violator’s suspended sentence should be removed in whole, in part, or not at all, pursuant to § 12-19-9.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant failed to keep the peace, failed to remain on good behavior, and was found in possession of stolen property, the evidence was more than sufficient to find defendant violated the terms of probation.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sentencing justice properly denied defendant’s motion to correct an illegal sentence pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-19-9 as no part of defendant’s suspended sentence began to run until either the end of the probationary period or until a determination that defendant violated probation; defendant was adjudged a probation violator and the order to serve the entire 10-years of his suspended sentence was not illegal despite less than two years remained on his 10-year period of probation. State v. Parson, 844 A.2d 178, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 67 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>After finding that defendant had violated his probation by committing an assault or battery on the complaining witness, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a seven-year prison sentence on defendant as the hearing justice included in the record a multitude of factors leading to his determination that defendant should be sentenced to serve seven years of his ten-year suspended sentence, including detailing defendant’s history of violent crime. State v. Jackson, 966 A.2d 1225, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 30 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the trial court found that defendant violated the terms of his probation by assaulting a woman, its revocation of three years of his suspended sentence was a sustainable exercise of its broad discretion.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s probation was properly revoked because defendant failed to keep the peace and be of good behavior when defendant violated two no-contact orders by making telephone calls to the complainant, one of which was actually made while a police officer was standing before defendant.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant violated probation for a second time, as R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-19-9 did not allow the execution of his previously suspended sentence to be stayed, the trial court properly corrected its error pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35(a), and did not abuse its discretion in determining what portion of his suspended sentence should be executed and what portion should remain suspended. State v. Roberts, 59 A.3d 693, 2013 R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Hearing justice did not abuse his discretion in executing the remaining eight and one-half years of defendant’s previously suspended sentence after finding that defendant was released from the correctional institution less than 48 hours before engaging in conduct that violated the terms of probation, defendant had engaged in physical violence during the original offense, and it appeared that defendant had preyed on the victim’s apparent vulnerability. State v. McKinnon-Conneally, 101 A.3d 875, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 138 (R.I. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Imposing an executed portion of defendant’s suspended sentence for a probation violation was not excessive because the gravity of defendant’s crimes and the crimes’ similarity to the basis of the probation violation were considered.

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although this section has been declared unconstitutional as an unlawful exercise of judicial power by the general assembly when applied to deferred sentence agreements entered into prior to its enactment; it is constitutional and must be given full force and effect with regard to deferred sentences agreed to after its enactment (citing State v. Plante, 109 R.I. 371, 285 A.2d 395 (1972) and distinguishing State v. Taylor, 108 R.I. 114, 272 A.2d 680 (1971)); State v. Garnetto, 75 R.I. 86, 63 A.2d 777 (1949)). Hazard v. Howard, 110 R.I. 107, 290 A.2d 603, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 885 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that the benefits under this section do not apply to probationers does not violate equal protection. State v. McConaghy, 215 R.I. 120, 386 A.2d 1380 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In deciding subsection (b) of this section was unconstitutional, the trial justice was without authority to raise and decide, sua sponte, a constitutional issue that was not squarely placed before him by the parties. State v. Beaudoin, 137 A.3d 717, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 56 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Deferred Sentence Violators.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because former R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-19-18 made no reference to a criminal information that had been filed and subsequently dismissed based on an application of the exclusionary rule, the trial justice did not err in denying defendant’s motion to quash and vacate the finding of a violation of defendant’s deferred sentence. State v. White, 37 A.3d 120, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 12 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Effect of Amendment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a case in which a trial justice imposed a suspended sentence and probationary term on defendant in 2009 following a plea of nolo contendere entered before subsection (b) was added to this section in 2010, but who was adjudged to be a probation violator, imprisoned as a result, and then acquitted by a jury on the underlying charges after the 2010 amendment, the Supreme Court concluded that the case entailed prospective, not retroactive, application of subsection (b). The trial justice’s imposition of the suspended sentence in 2009 was not the event that triggered application of subsection (b). State v. Beaudoin, 137 A.3d 717, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 56 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was sentenced to prison upon being determined a deferred sentence violator in a hearing brought on by an alleged crime for which grand jury later refused to indict, trial court erred in its denial of defendant’s motion to quash the sentence by its consideration of evidence unrelated to the alleged crime and not presented at the hearing. State v. Marfeo, 112 R.I. 577, 313 A.2d 646, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1471 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Probation Violators Not Covered.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute applies only to deferred sentence agreement violators and not probation violators. State v. Jones, 116 R.I. 148, 352 A.2d 656, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1256 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Requirements.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Nothing more is required to find a probationer in violation of his deferred sentence agreement than that which will suffice to find violation of a suspended sentence. State v. Plante, 109 R.I. 371, 285 A.2d 395, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 1195 (1972).</p>

When a court formally defers sentence, the court may only impose sentence up to five (5) years from and after the date of the written deferral agreement, unless during the required period, the person shall be declared to have violated the terms and conditions of the deferment pursuant to subsection (b) in which event the court may impose sentence.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The court may require that the person agreeing to said deferment of sentence shall not violate any condition of the written deferral agreement.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Imposing an additional 25 years pursuant to this section, after the imposition of two life sentences without eligibility for parole, was not cruel and unusual punishment, where the defendant had two prior convictions for rape of a child under the age of 16 in Massachusetts for which he received prison sentences, and where he was found guilty and convicted of the murders and torture of two children with a screwdriver in Rhode Island. State v. Smith, 602 A.2d 931, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 18 (R.I. 1992).</p>

Ramirez, 936 A.2d 1254, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 130 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s rights under the Rhode Island Constitution and the Sixth Amendment were not violated when the trial court found that defendant was a habitual offender pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-19-21 without submitting that question to the jury to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Recidivism was quite common and the fact of prior convictions was easily determined by resort to the public record, which meant that the fact of a prior conviction did not have to be submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt to obtain habitual offender sentencing. State v. Hall, 940 A.2d 645, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 7 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While defendant did not serve time in prison on a prior drug charge, R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-19-21 merely required a person to have been at least twice convicted and sentenced to serve a term in prison; consequently, as defendant’s conviction with a suspended sentence might properly constitute a predicate offense, defendant’s R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 motion was properly denied. State v. Lyons, 37 A.3d 118, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 11 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court did not err in denying an applicant’s petition for postconviction relief because the trial court did properly invoke the habitual-criminal statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-19-21, by finding the applicant a habitual criminal; the statute was not intended to only apply to someone with a more extensive criminal record. Spratt v. State, 41 A.3d 984, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 45 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s sentence of 25 years plus life was not erroneous because defendant’s particularly horrific crime and prior convictions supported the sentence. State v. Tejeda, 171 A.3d 983, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 106 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Language of subsection (b) of this section is clear and unambiguous; the statutory language does not require that a sentencing justice set a particular date when a defendant will be eligible for parole, but rather, the statute simply provides that a defendant must serve a minimum number of years (to be determined by the sentencing justice) before being eligible for parole. State v. Paiva, 200 A.3d 665, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 16 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to correct his sentence because the sentencing justice complied with the habitual offender statute by ordering defendant to serve a minimum number of years of the sentence before he became eligible for parole. State v. Paiva, 200 A.3d 665, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 16 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Legislative Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 12-19-21 is consistent with the requirement of R.I. Const., art. 1, § 8, that the punishment should be in proportion to the offense. The statute reflects the legislature’s determination that a third or subsequent offense is more serious than a first or second offense and accordingly should be punishable as such. State v. Tregaskis, 540 A.2d 1022, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 69 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature did not intend that the state should be deprived of its statutory right to seek enhanced sentencing under the habitual offender provisions where the intent to seek such sentencing was filed later than forty-five days after the arraignment, but prior to a continued pretrial conference. State v. Peterson, 722 A.2d 259, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 315 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Procedure.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state does not have the option of proceeding by separate information charging one with being a habitual criminal after sentence has been imposed for the last conviction. State v. Sitko, 457 A.2d 260, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 834 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>After the defendant is already sentenced for his last conviction, the state can no longer invoke the provisions of this section, and the court may no longer impose an enhanced sentence thereunder. State v. Sitko, 457 A.2d 260, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 834 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The habitual-offender statute does not create a new substantive offense, but instead the statute merely prescribes a longer sentence for the subsequent offense which triggers the operation of the act; therefore, where the trial justice imposed a sentence as though the status of being an habitual offender constituted a separate substantive offense, the decision was vacated and remanded to the superior court. State v. Campaniello, 474 A.2d 1247, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 502 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A failure to file a written notice with the court does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to hear a habitual-offender petition where the defendant receives timely notification in open court that he would be subject to habitual offender treatment. State v. Tregaskis, 540 A.2d 1022, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 69 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not create a separate substantive offense requiring a separate trial. State v. Morris, 744 A.2d 850, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 16 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure to provide notice to defendant that habitual criminal sentencing would be sought required vacation of the extra sentence imposed, although the underlying sentences for defendant’s various convictions survived review. State v. Werner, 851 A.2d 1093, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 148 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not err in imposing the additional sentence upon defendant as a habitual offender, as defendant received timely notice, 12 days after the triggering arraignment. State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1232, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 115 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State’s notice to defendant of its intent to seek a habitual-offender adjudication, while shoddy, was adequate, as attached was defendant’s criminal record with the felonies relied upon circled. State v. Marsich, 10 A.3d 435, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 118 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Counsel was not ineffective for not objecting to the State’s allegedly untimely notice of intent to seek habitual offender sentencing because the notice was not untimely, as the notice was filed at a continued pretrial conference. Ricci v. State, 196 A.3d 292, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 115 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Resentencing Upon Remand.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court remanded a case for resentencing because the trial justice sentenced the defendant on an independent habitual offender count. Upon remand, the trial justice vacated the sentence previously imposed for the substantive offense by changing the punishment from “three years” to “three years plus enhancement of five years”. The trial justice’s action fully complied with the supreme court’s mandate and did not deprive the defendant of any constitutional guarantees. See State v. Campaniello, 494 A.2d 898, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 553 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Proffer.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the state’s proffer of docket face sheets of the defendant’s state convictions was insufficient to meet its burden of proof under this section since it explicitly provides for authenticated copies of judgments and commitments, remand was required for determination of the issue of habitual criminal status.

<p class="p7"><b>Sentence Upheld.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice was within her discretion in imposing the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole where, confronted with a first-time offender found guilty of a particularly gruesome and heinous murder, she carefully considered the nature of the offense and the personal character and propensities of the offender and concluded that he would “never change from the completely evil person that he is.” State v. Tassone, 749 A.2d 1112, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 101 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1, and the evidence overwhelmingly supported the jury’s verdict, there was support for the imposition of a life sentence without the possibility of parole, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2; in conducting a review of the sentence imposed pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 12-19.2-4 and 12-19.2-5, the mitigating factors, the findings of the trial justice, and the personal character, record, and propensities of defendant did not outweigh the aggravating factors that were established. State v. Motyka, 893 A.2d 267, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 36 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sentence of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole imposed upon second defendant for first degree murder was proper given, inter alia, the nature of the offenses, in which two person were brutally murdered and their hands cut off in an effort to thwart the investigation, and the failure to show remorse. State v. Quinlan, 921 A.2d 96, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 86 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s sentence of life without parole for the first-degree murder of his wife was proper, as defendant repeatedly stabbed his wife as the she lay crouched in a fetal position on the floor, vulnerable and defenseless, and continued to stab her even after rendering her helpless. State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 21 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was appropriate because: (1) the jury unanimously found that defendant murdered an innocent man whom defendant never before had met, in exchange for money; (2) defendant shot and killed the victim in front of the victim’s eight-year-old son, forever changing the lives of the young boy and the victim’s other family members; (3) defendant’s actions reflected a complete disregard for human life, and, thus, warranted the harshest penalty; (4) defendant’s troubling character, record, and propensity for criminal activity made it unlikely that he could have been rehabilitated; and (5) there was no indication that defendant showed any real remorse for the murder. State v. Graham, 941 A.2d 848, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 22 (R.I.), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 848, 129 S. Ct. 99, 172 L. Ed. 2d 82, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 6960 (2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Imposition of sentence of life without parole was not error, where the record supporting the trial court’s finding that the offense was a “most heinous” crime and nothing in the record indicated that defendant had shown any remorse for what he had done. State v. Mlyniec, 15 A.3d 983, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 25 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was appropriate considering defendant’s lack of remorse and the extreme brutality evident in the murder, where the victim was stabbed 40 times with a serrated knife. The brutal slaying undoubtedly fell within the definition of aggravated battery. State v. Lopez, 45 A.3d 1, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 91 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant, convicted of the first-degree murder of his girlfriend, was properly sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, because the evidence supported the jury’s finding that he committed the murder with aggravated battery and torture, as well as the trial court’s finding that his character and propensities made it unlikely that he would be rehabilitated.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">In order that the sentences imposed upon convicted criminals by the courts of this state do justice to the victim, the offender, and the community, a system of sentencing standards is enacted. Those standards are intended to create a sentencing process which will allow for judicial consideration of mitigating and aggravating circumstances unique to the particular defendant and crime, while providing the structure necessary to impose consistent sentences upon similar offenders convicted of like crimes.</p>

<p class="p6">Each year the justices of the superior court shall by majority vote, and with the approval of the supreme court, adopt as a rule of court presumptive sentences to be imposed upon defendants who have been found guilty after a trial. The rule shall establish a presumptive sentence or sentencing range for each category of felony which constituted more than five percent (5%) of the criminal caseload in the superior court during the preceding year and for any additional categories of felonies that the justices deem appropriate. It shall also set forth the criteria for evaluation upon which the presumptive sentences are based. Prior to implementation, the rule shall be forwarded to the supreme court for its approval. A complete listing of the presumptive sentences so established shall be made public no less than thirty (30) days prior to implementation.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">In all cases where the defendant has been found guilty after trial of an offense for which a sentencing standard has been established pursuant to § 12-19.3-2, the trial justice shall impose a sentence within the presumptive sentencing range unless he or she finds that substantial and compelling circumstances exist which justify imposition of an alternative sentence. This finding may be based upon the character and background of the defendant, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and/or the nature and quality of the evidence presented at trial. When justified by those factors, he or she may impose either a more lenient or a more severe sentence than provided for in the rule. If a sentence outside of the presumptive range is imposed, the trial justice shall set forth on the record the circumstances which he or she found as justification for imposition of the alternative sentence.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>1976 Amendment Unconstitutional.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The General Assembly acted unconstitutionally when in 1976 it established the classification “violation” and failed to provide a de novo appeal to the Superior Court as it did for those individuals who were charged with committing misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors. State v. Vinagro, 433 A.2d 945, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1247 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The 1976 amendment to this section and enactment of § 12-22-1.1 were impermissible with respect to those violations which are criminal in nature because in 1842 a defendant could appeal de novo from any criminal conviction of a justice of the peace. State v. Vinagro, 433 A.2d 945, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1247 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Nature of Appeal.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>On appeal to the superior court the justice is required to hear the case de novo in its entirety under § 12-17-1 and he lacks authority to determine the correctness or legality of the rulings of the justice of the district court. State v. McGuire, 90 R.I. 301, 157 A.2d 657, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 8 (1960); State v. Avila, 415 A.2d 180, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1676 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under state statutes the taking of an appeal operates to vacate a decision of a district or police court. State v. Diggins, 95 R.I. 166, 185 A.2d 300, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 139 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where conviction of the defendant in the police court where he was charged with violating a traffic ordinance of the city of Providence was not final and by his appeal the defendant, exercising his rights under the statute, asked for and was granted a trial de novo on the facts and the law in the superior court, his satisfying the sentence in the police court by paying the penalty was voluntary and gratuitous and was not such an act as would entitle him to claim double jeopardy in the imposition of a sentence by the superior court. State v. Diggins, 95 R.I. 166, 185 A.2d 300, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 139 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The appeal to the Superior Court provided by this section is a de novo appeal and is to be tried by a jury unless the defendant waives his right to the jury trial. State v. Vinagro, 433 A.2d 945, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1247 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Procedure to Be Followed.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Those charged with serious misdemeanors are entitled to a jury trial in the first instance and, pending appropriate action by the general assembly to so provide, the supreme court has ordered that, after August 11, 1971, a district court defendant charged with a misdemeanor for which he could be imprisoned for more than six months shall be advised of his right to a trial by jury and be given ten days after arraignment to file a waiver of such right, and his failure to file such waiver shall constitute a claim of his right to a jury and a waiver of his right to a non-jury trial in the district court and right of appeal to the superior court; and upon failure to file a waiver the clerk of the district court division in which he was arraigned shall send the record of the case to the clerk of the superior court in the county wherein the offense was alleged to have been committed, who shall docket it on the appropriate jury calendar. State v. Holliday, 109 R.I. 93, 280 A.2d 333, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1029 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendants, who had waived a jury trial in the first instance and were subsequently convicted of nonpetty offenses in District Court, were entitled to a jury trial in their appeal pursuant to this section. State v. Avila, 415 A.2d 180, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1676 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Superior Court was without authority to undertake appellate review of a District Court’s finding that defendant was guilty; the Superior Court improperly evaluated the correctness of the District Court’s findings after defendant sought and obtained appellate review. When a District Court judgment is appealed under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-22-1, the state, as well as the accused, is entitled to a trial <i>de novo. </i>State v. McManus, 950 A.2d 1180, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 72 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Release Pending Appeal.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where appeals were on traffic offenses, giving of recognizance for discharge pending appeal was not required for claims and certification under § 12-22-4. In re 125 Criminal Appeals, 113 R.I. 365, 321 A.2d 294, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1187 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Res Judicata.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An applicant’s second petition for postconviction relief was barred by R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-9.1-8 and the doctrine of res judicata when the applicant knew before the filing of the first petition that he and one of his codefendants had shared the same attorney, and he could have and should have raised the issue in his first petition; the applicant’s failure to raise the issue in his first petition resulted in a bar to the litigation of that issue and that claim for relief, and the applicant failed to show that the interest of justice required the supreme court to revisit the issue. Ferrell v. Wall, 971 A.2d 615, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 80 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sentence on Appeal.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The superior court possesses the power to impose a sentence after trial de novo more severe than that imposed by the district court. State v. Avila, 415 A.2d 180, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1676 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the possibility of removal from work release was a collateral consequence of a prisoner’s plea, and neither the trial justice nor defense counsel had no obligation to inform the prisoner of that possibility, the fact that the prisoner might not have fully appreciated the possibility of his being removed from the work-release program for disciplinary infractions was not grounds for vacating his plea, and the prisoner’s motion for postconviction relief was properly denied. Smith v. State, 909 A.2d 40, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 161 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Services of Stenographer and Transcript.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the services of a stenographer and a transcript in a district court proceeding might be helpful to the defendant in exercising his right to appeal hereunder, such services are not required for the exercise of such right and the state is not mandated by U.S. Const., amend. 14, to provide such services for the defendant. State v. Gill, 115 R.I. 160, 342 A.2d 256, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1137 (1975).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Statutory Period for Filing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statutory period within which an appeal from the decision of the lower court must be taken cannot be extended by judicial authority. Pickett v. Conley, 89 R.I. 261, 152 A.2d 229, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 77 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Superior Court Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court had jurisdiction to conduct a trial de novo as to a charge that defendant violated Providence, R.I., Code of Ordinances § 16-93, barring loud noise in certain locations, because the indicia of criminality associated with defendant’s prosecution gave defendant a right to a jury trial, giving the superior court jurisdiction under R.I.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The purpose of this chapter is to recognize the importance of domestic violence as a serious crime against society and to assure victims of domestic violence the maximum protection from abuse which the law and those who enforce the law can provide.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> While the legislature finds that the existing criminal statutes are adequate to provide protection for victims of domestic violence, previous societal attitudes have been reflected in policies and practices of law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and courts which have resulted in differing treatment of crimes occurring between family or household members and of the same crimes occurring between strangers. Only recently has public perception of the serious consequences of domestic violence to society and to the victims led to the recognition of the necessity for early intervention by law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> It is the intent of the legislature that the official response to cases of domestic violence shall stress the enforcement of the laws to protect the victim and shall communicate the attitude that violent behavior is not excused or tolerated. Furthermore, it is the intent of the legislature that criminal laws be enforced without regard to whether the persons involved are or were married, cohabitating, or involved in a relationship.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the courts were not in the business of supplying essential elements of a felony offense by implication, and because a conviction for a violation of a no-contact order was not an enumerated offense in R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-2 thus, holding that a violation of a no-contact order was not a domestic violence misdemeanor conviction for purposes of sentencing enhancement did not render meaningless the declared purpose in R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-1 which was to assure victims of domestic violence the maximum protection from abuse which the law and those who enforced the law could provide. State v.

<p class="p7"><b>Disorderly Conduct.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s claim that his prosecution for disorderly conduct pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-1 and R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-2 was barred because his violent behavior following an argument with his wife did not occur in a public place, but in his private residence, had to be rejected; nothing in the language of those statutes or in constitutional provisions prohibited those laws from applying to crimes committed in the home, especially since the state had an interest in trying to prevent domestic violence. State v. Russell, 890 A.2d 453, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 9 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of domestic simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct because neither the purported inconsistencies in the victim’s testimony nor any contradictory evidence undermined defendant’s convictions as the victim told the responding officer that defendant had beat her and kicked her, punched her, and stomped on her; the officer observed bruises on her forehead, face, and chin area; defendant admitted to the officer that he had hit and punched the victim after she had slapped him; and an emergency room physician testified that the victim presented with an ear contusion and lacerations, hand contusion, ankle abrasion, and a blow to the head, and that she was discharged after receiving 10 sutures. State v. Van Dongen, 132 A.3d 1070, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 31 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Domestic Violence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for domestic assault, when determining whether a couple has been in a “substantive dating relationship,” R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-2 directs the court to look to three factors—length, nature, and frequency—as indicative of the substance of the relationship as a whole. Section 12-29-2 does not require a specific demonstration or finding as to each of the factors, nor does it limit the court to only those three factors. State v. Enos, 21 A.3d 326, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 88 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for domestic assault with a deadly weapon, the following evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant and the victim had been in a “substantive dating relationship” for purposes of R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-2(b): 1) the couple dated for six months; 2) they had an intimate relationship; 3) they had communication since their breakup relative to affairs of the heart; 4) they met on the night of the assault so the victim could return jewelry defendant had given her; and 5) defendant said at the scene that he had “an argument with his girlfriend.” State v. Enos, 21 A.3d 326, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 88 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Felony Convictions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since defendant’s conviction for domestic disorderly conduct could not be a basis for subjecting him to a felony conviction pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-5, the felony conviction had to be vacated and the case remanded for entry of judgments of conviction for the lesser included misdemeanor offenses of twice violating the no-contact order. State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 182 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>No-Contact Order.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s conviction in the superior court under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-5(c)(1)(ii), based on a third violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-2(a)(10) (amended 2001), which included violations of a protective order, but which made no mention of no-contact orders, was vacated because defendant’s second conviction was under R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-15-3(d)(1) for violating a no-contact order issued under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-4, and a conviction for a violation of a no-contact order was not an enumerated offense in R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-2 (amended 2001); at best, defendant committed a misdemeanor violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-15-3, an offense cognizable in the district court. State v. Carter, 827 A.2d 636, 2003 R.I.

<p class="p6"><b>(a) (1)</b> Because of the likelihood of repeated violence directed at those who have been victims of domestic violence in the past, when a person is charged with or arrested for a crime involving domestic violence, that person may not be released from custody on bail or personal recognizance before arraignment without first appearing before the court or bail commissioner.

<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Notwithstanding the provisions of section 12-10-12, the filing of any complaint for a crime involving domestic violence shall be conditioned upon the defendant keeping the peace and being of good behavior for a period of three (3) years. In the event a particular case involving domestic violence is filed on a plea of not guilty, guilty or nolo contendere pursuant to section 12-10-12, the court having jurisdiction shall retain the records of the case for a period of three (3) years from the date of the filing. These records shall not be expunged, sealed, or otherwise destroyed for a period of three (3) years from the date of filing. Furthermore, the destruction or sealing of records in the possession of the department of attorney general bureau of criminal identification, the superintendent of the state police, or the police departments of any city or town after a filing related to a crime involving domestic violence shall be governed by section 12-1-12.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Jury Instructions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was charged with violating a no contact order by sending two cards to his former wife, the trial justice’s instruction adequately covered the law by informing the members of the jury that they must find that defendant was aware of the restriction on his behavior by reason of the no-contact order. State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 182 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Merger.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice erred in ruling that two no-contact order violations did not merge because the conduct that predicated one no-contact order violation and the conduct that resulted in a second violation were part of a single and continuous act; the violations flowed from defendant and his ex-girlfriend being at an establishment together and then arriving at the ex-girlfriend’s home shortly thereafter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>State v. Narcovich, 244 A.3d 549, 2021 R.I. LEXIS 8 (R.I. 2021).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>No-Contact Order.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant’s conduct was not sufficient to support a finding that he violated a no-contact order since all of the alleged incidents were mere coincidence, and the defendant’s only conduct in each of the incidents was to acknowledge the victim with a simple greeting. State v. Conti, 672 A.2d 885, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 109 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s conviction in the superior court under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-5(c)(1)(ii), based on a third violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-2(a)(10) (amended 2001), which included violations of a protective order, but which made no mention of no-contact orders, was vacated because defendant’s second conviction was under R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-15-3(d)(1) for violating a no-contact order issued under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-4, and a conviction for a violation of a no-contact order was not an enumerated offense in R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-2 (amended 2001); at best, defendant committed a misdemeanor violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-15-3, an offense cognizable in the district court. State v. Carter, 827 A.2d 636, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 180 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sufficient evidence existed for a jury to find that defendant willfully violated a no-contact order where defendant testified that he was aware of the order and knew that he was violating it when he had an altercation with the ex-wife at her home and the order said that defendant was enjoined or restrained from any contact with his ex-wife; it did not include an exception permitting him to contact his ex-wife to discuss visitation or the well-being of his children.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for domestic simple assault, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the prosecutor to impeach defendant with seven prior convictions, two of which involved assaultive behavior, because the similarity between the charged offense and the prior convictions did not preclude admission of those convictions. State v. McRae, 31 A.3d 785, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 131 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As defense counsel sought to convince the jury that defendant was guilty of second-degree murder because he “snapped,” testimony that he had previously assaulted the victim, his girlfriend, was properly admitted under R.I. R. Evid. 404(b) for the limited purpose of proving he formed the intent necessary to be convicted of first-degree murder. State v. Martinez, 59 A.3d 73, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 20 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a case resulting in defendant’s conviction for domestic assault with a dangerous weapon based on her assault of her half-sister with a knife, where defendant claimed self-defense, the trial justice did not err in excluding Facebook videos illustrating the victim’s acts of violence because the trial justice determined that the videos were cumulative to the victim’s testimony, would inflame the passion of the jurors, and would cause confusion as to what the ultimate issue in the case was. State v. Medina, 222 A.3d 1246, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 1 (R.I. 2020).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a case resulting in defendant’s conviction for domestic assault with a dangerous weapon based on her assault of her half-sister with a knife, the trial justice provided adequate grounds to support the granting of the State’s motion in limine to prevent defendant from mentioning that the victim had been arrested on gun charges; the charges were eventually dismissed as to the victim and use of a gun was not in issue in the current case. State v. Medina, 222 A.3d 1246, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 1 (R.I. 2020).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Denial of Motion to Pass.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for domestic simple assault, the victim’s testimony that defendant had been drinking at the time of the incident did not obligate the trial court to pass the case, as the comment was not sufficiently prejudicial as to prevent the jury from dispassionately considering the evidence, and there was no indication that it failed to obey the trial court’s instruction to disregard the victim’s statement. State v. McRae, 31 A.3d 785, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 131 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Felony Convictions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since defendant’s conviction for domestic disorderly conduct could not be a basis for subjecting him to a felony conviction pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-5, the felony conviction had to be vacated and the case remanded for entry of judgments of conviction for the lesser included misdemeanor offenses of twice violating the no-contact order. State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 182 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Instructions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In light of the reference to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-3 in the criminal information and the trial evidence indicating that defendant put the victims in reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on both assault and battery. Ultimately, defendant was convicted of two counts of felony domestic assault, as charged in the information; he was neither convicted of nor sentenced for a criminal battery. State v. Cardona, 969 A.2d 667, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 54 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Merger.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice erred in ruling that two no-contact order violations did not merge because the conduct that predicated one no-contact order violation and the conduct that resulted in a second violation were part of a single and continuous act; the violations flowed from defendant and his ex-girlfriend being at an establishment together and then arriving at the ex-girlfriend’s home shortly thereafter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>State v. Narcovich, 244 A.3d 549, 2021 R.I. LEXIS 8 (R.I. 2021).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Motion for Mistrial.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for domestic first-degree sexual assault, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to declare a mistrial when a police officer improperly bolstered the victim’s credibility by testifying that she seemed “sincere” when she accused defendant, her husband, of sexual assault, in view of the brevity of the remark, the jurors’ opportunity to judge the victim’s truthfulness before the remark was made, and the trial court’s instruction to disregard the remark. State v. Rushlow, 32 A.3d 892, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 140 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for domestic first-degree sexual assault, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to declare a mistrial when the victim, defendant’s wife, testified that the police had issued to her a no-contact order against him, because 1) the trial court gave a cautionary instruction that the jurors could not use this testimony to find that defendant engaged in any prior misconduct; 2) the testimony was not sufficiently prejudicial as to prevent the jury from dispassionately considering the evidence; and 3) there was abundant evidence of defendant’s guilt. State v. Rushlow, 32 A.3d 892, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 140 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>No-Contact Order.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant’s conduct was not sufficient to support a finding that he violated a no-contact order since all of the alleged incidents were mere coincidence, and the defendant’s only conduct in each of the incidents was to acknowledge the victim with a simple greeting. State v. Conti, 672 A.2d 885, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 109 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s conviction in the superior court under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-5(c)(1)(ii), based on a third violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-2(a)(10) (amended 2001), which included violations of a protective order, but which made no mention of no-contact orders, was vacated because defendant’s second conviction was under R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-15-3(d)(1) for violating a no-contact order issued under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-4, and a conviction for a violation of a no-contact order was not an enumerated offense in R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-2 (amended 2001); at best, defendant committed a misdemeanor violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-15-3, an offense cognizable in the district court. State v. Carter, 827 A.2d 636, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 180 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the allegations that defendant committed a felony were sufficient to invoke the trial court’s subject-matter jurisdiction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 8-2-15, and because defendant failed to preserve defendant’s R.I. Super. Ct. R. Prac. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal, defendant was properly convicted of violating a no-contact order and simple assault. State v. Tower, 984 A.2d 40, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 137 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sentencing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 motion was properly denied because defendant unequivocally waived all nonjurisdictional defects in a criminal information charging defendant with violating a no-contact order by pleading nolo contendere, and defendant’s sentence was well within the prescribed statutory limits of R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-29-5(c)(1)(ii). State v. Murray, 44 A.3d 139, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 67 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since defendant was expressly enjoined from any contact with his former wife, his sending birthday cards constituted contact; thus, there was sufficient evidence to support his violation of the no-contact order. State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 182 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a domestic assault prosecution, defendant’s wife recanted her statements to police that he hit and kicked her son and tried to slap the phone out of her hand to prevent her from calling police. However, her trial testimony that it looked like defendant was hitting her son, and that defendant tapped her arm and swore at her to prevent her from calling police, created a jury question of whether he committed acts that put her and her son in reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm. State v. Cardona, 969 A.2d 667, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 54 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of domestic simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct because neither the purported inconsistencies in the victim’s testimony nor any contradictory evidence undermined defendant’s convictions as the victim told the responding officer that defendant had beat her and kicked her, punched her, and stomped on her; the officer observed bruises on her forehead, face, and chin area; defendant admitted to the officer that he had hit and punched the victim after she had slapped him; and an emergency room physician testified that the victim presented with an ear contusion and lacerations, hand contusion, ankle abrasion, and a blow to the head, and that she was discharged after receiving 10 sutures.

These witnesses are to be protected from actions wrongfully taken against them, or their family, because of their participation as a witness. The standards set forth in this chapter are intended:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> To encourage the cooperation of potential witnesses with law enforcement authorities;</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> To provide accountability in the cost and operation of the witness program; and</p>

<p class="p6"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Comparing the language of this section with the terms of § 13-6-3, the supreme court found that each clearly serves a separate statutory purpose. Bogosian v. Vaccaro, 422 A.2d 1253, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1873 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The civil-death proviso found in this section cannot be triggered until such time as there has been a final judgment of conviction. Bogosian v. Vaccaro, 422 A.2d 1253, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1873 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was no error to dismiss an inmate’s tort claims; while the court had subject matter jurisdiction, the court did not have authority to proceed, as (1) the inmate was serving a life sentence, (2) the Legislature had unambiguously mandated in R.I. Gen. Laws 13-6-1 that persons serving life sentences were prohibited from asserting civil actions, and (3) the inmate did not fall under any exception to that statute. Gallop v. Adult Corr. Insts., 182 A.3d 1137, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 44 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Issue of whether this section, the civil death statute, was unconstitutional was barred by the “raise-or-waive” rule and procedural law; plaintiff’s opportunity to challenge the civil death statute’s constitutionality before the appellate court was confined to federal civil rights claims, but those claims were not before the trial court and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. Gallop v. Adult Corr. Insts., 218 A.3d 543, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 120 (R.I. 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 1298, 206 L. Ed. 2d 377, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 1635 (2020).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The permissive portions of § 13-6-3 refer to a prisoner who receives something less than a life sentence.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Inmate’s request to have the record of the inmate’s allegedly invalid marriage sealed was properly denied, and the inmate had no right to appeal that denial, because, as the inmate had been sentenced to life in prison, the inmate had no right to have the record sealed, as the inmate was “civilly dead” under this section, and, for that reason, the inmate had no right to litigate the issue, and the trial court had no authority to entertain any issue except whether the inmate was in fact civilly dead.

<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> If a prisoner is confined upon more than one sentence, a parole permit may be issued whenever he or she has served a term equal to one-third (1/3) of the aggregate time which he or she shall be liable to serve under his or her several sentences, unless he or she has been sentenced to serve two (2) or more terms concurrently, in which case the permit shall be issued when he or she has served a term equal to one-third (1/3) of the maximum term he or she is required to serve.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> If a prisoner, whether in confinement or on parole, is sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment for an offense which was committed after imposition of the sentence then being served, a permit may not be issued until he or she has served in confinement at least one-third (1/3) of the term of imprisonment to which he or she is sentenced for the subsequent offense. In calculating the date the prisoner shall become eligible for a permit, the time spent in confinement on an earlier imposed concurrent sentence shall not be credited for the purposes of parole eligibility on the subsequent sentence. In the event a prisoner is convicted of two (2) or more subsequent offenses and is sentenced to multiple terms of imprisonment for those offenses, the standards contained in subsection (a) of this section shall be used to determine when he or she has served one-third (1/3) of the terms of confinement imposed for the subsequent offenses and thereby is eligible for issuance of a permit under this subsection.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> At least once each calendar year the parole board shall adopt standards to be utilized by the board in evaluating applications for parole of persons convicted of a criminal offense and sentenced to the adult correctional institutions. These standards shall establish, with the range of parole eligibility set by statute, the portion of a sentence which should be served depending on the likelihood of recidivism as determined by a risk assessment, and shall serve as guidelines for the board in making individual parole determinations.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> The board shall consider the applicable standard prior to rendering a decision on a parole application, and may make a determination at variance with that standard only upon a finding that the determination is warranted by individualized factors, such as the character, criminal history, and attitudes of the applicant that bear on the likelihood to reoffend, the conduct of the applicant while incarcerated, including meaningful participation in a risk-reducing program and substantial compliance with the rules of the institution, and risk-reducing behavior and the criteria set forth in § 13-8-14. “Risk-reducing program” means a program that adheres to those elements that are shown in research to reduce recidivism.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(c)</b> In each case where the board grants an application prior to the time set by the applicable standard or denies an application on or after the time set by that standard, the board shall set forth in writing the rationale for its determination.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>Life Sentence.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The parole board did not act arbitrarily in denying the request for parole of a prisoner convicted of first-degree sexual assault in 1981 and sentenced to life imprisonment, because the prisoner was not eligible for parole until he had served at least 15 years. The Rhode Island Parole Board Guidelines provide that “a person convicted and sentenced to prison on a charge of first-degree sexual assault . . . should serve two-thirds (2/3) of his/her sentence before being considered for parole release”. Since the board employed a period of 30 years when computing the parole eligibility of an inmate serving a life sentence, it would have been completely justified in ruling that the prisoner would not have been eligible for parole consideration until 20 years (not to mention 15 years) had elapsed, which by clear implication would have been two-thirds of the life sentence.

<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person who has been placed on community supervision shall be subject to the provisions of law governing parole as if the person were a parolee. The parole board shall impose terms and conditions for the sentence within thirty (30) days of sentencing. The terms and conditions may be revised, altered, and amended by the parole board at any time.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> A person under community supervision shall be under the jurisdiction, supervision and control of the parole board in the same manner as a person under parole supervision. The board is authorized on an individual basis to establish any conditions of community supervision that may be necessary to ensure public safety, which may include protecting the public from a person committing a sex offense including child molestation or child kidnapping as well as promoting the rehabilitation of the person. The conditions shall include at the expense of the offender sex offender treatment with a recognized treatment provider in the field to be determined by the board for as long as the board deems necessary, and compliance with the requirements of chapter 37 of title 11.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(c)</b> The board is authorized to impose and enforce a supervision fee, and rehabilitation fee upon a person on community supervision. To the extent possible the board shall set the fee in an amount that will substantially defray the cost of the community supervision program.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(d)</b> The board shall also establish a fee waiver procedure for hardship cases and indigency.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(e)</b> After a person sentenced to community supervision has been under supervision for a period of fifteen (15) years or any time after the person ceases to be a resident of the state, the person may petition the board for termination of community supervision. A petition for termination which is based upon the person no longer being a resident of Rhode Island shall be accompanied by an affidavit of the person attesting to his or her non-residency and providing his or her new out of state address. A petition for termination which is based upon the completion of fifteen (15) years of community supervision may only occur by a majority vote of all the members of the community supervision board. Termination may only occur by a majority vote of all the members. Upon receiving a petition for termination, the board shall, within sixty (60) days, conduct a hearing before the full membership. At least thirty (30) days prior to a hearing on the petition, the board shall cause a criminal history check to be conducted, and notify in writing the victims of the crime for which the sentence was imposed, the attorney general, and the chief of police or head of the organized police department of the municipality in which the crime was committed, and the chief of police or head of the organized police department of the municipality in which the person resides, of the person’s petition for release from community supervision. Those officials and victims shall be provided the opportunity to respond to the petition. The officials and victims may appear in person or be represented or make written recommendations to the board, but failure of any or all of the officials to appear or make recommendations shall not delay the termination procedure.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(f)</b> If a victim is deceased at the time the termination hearing is scheduled the deceased victim may be represented by his relatives in the following order: mother, father, spouse, child, grandchild, brother or sister, niece or nephew.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(g)</b> Prior to the hearing, the petitioner shall be examined, personally interviewed and evaluated by a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist, who is an expert in the field of sex offender treatment and approved by the board. The psychiatrist or psychologist shall file written reports with the board of his or her examinations and diagnoses, and his or her recommendation for the disposition of the person. The petitioner’s treatment while on community supervision shall be examined and considered by the psychiatrist or psychologist in the recommendation. The reports shall be admissible in a hearing pursuant to this section. If the person refuses, without good cause, to be personally interviewed by the psychiatrist or psychologist, the person shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to a hearing on the petition, and the petition shall be dismissed by the board. The cost of the examination and evaluation shall be the responsibility of the person petitioning for release from supervision; provided, that procedures shall be established for cases of hardship or indigency.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(h)</b> At the hearing, the board shall call any witnesses that it deems necessary, including the examining psychiatrist or psychologist, the attorney general, the police chief or the victims of the crime or his or her family member, as the board deems necessary. The petitioner may offer any witnesses and other proof at the hearing that is relevant to the petition.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(i)</b> The board shall terminate community supervision if the petitioner demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that he or she has not committed a sex offense of child kidnapping since his or her conviction, that he or she is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others, and that the public interest is not served by further community supervision.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(j)</b> If a petition for release from supervision is denied by the board, the person may not file another petition for a period of three (3) years.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> The parole board is authorized to grant geriatric parole release of a prisoner, except a prisoner serving life without parole, who is an aging prisoner within the meaning of § 13-8.1-3(1) or under medical parole as outlined by § 13-8.1-2.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(c)</b> In order to apply for this relief, the prisoner or his or her family member or friend, with an attending physician’s written approval, or an attending physician, on behalf of the prisoner, shall file an application with the director of the department of corrections.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> Degree of incapacity or disability, including an assessment of whether the prisoner is ambulatory, capable of engaging in any substantial physical activity, ability to independently provide for their daily life activities, and the extent of that activity; and</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> An opinion from the medical director as to whether the person is terminally ill, and if so, the stage of the illness, or whether the person is permanently physically or cognitively incapacitated, severely ill, or an aging prisoner. If the medical director’s opinion is that the person is not terminally ill, permanently, physically or cognitively incapacitated, severely ill, or an aging prisoner as defined in § 13-8.1-3, the petition for medical or geriatric parole shall not be forwarded to the parole board.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(f)</b> The department of corrections and the parole board shall jointly develop standards for the medical or geriatric discharge plan that are appropriately adapted to the criminal justice setting. The discharge plan should ensure at the minimum that:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> An appropriate placement for the prisoner has been secured, including, but not limited to: a hospital, nursing facility, hospice, or family home;</p>

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, medical or geriatric release may be granted at any time during the term of a prisoner’s sentence.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(h)</b> There shall be a presumption that the opinion of the physician and/or medical director will be accepted.

The evaluation shall be completed and a report, containing the information required by subsection (d) of this section, filed with the director and the parole board, and a copy sent to the applicant within fourteen (14) days from the date of the request.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(i)</b> Within seven (7) days of receiving the application, the medical or geriatric report and the discharge plan, the parole board shall determine whether the application, on its face, demonstrates that relief may be warranted. If the face of the application clearly demonstrates that relief is unwarranted, the board may deny the application without a hearing or further proceedings, and within seven (7) days shall notify the prisoner in writing of its decision to deny the application, setting forth its factual findings and a brief statement of the reasons for denying release without a hearing. Denial of release does not preclude the prisoner from reapplying for medical or geriatric parole after the expiration of sixty (60) days. A reapplication under this section must demonstrate a material change in circumstances.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8">There is hereby established a certificate of recovery &amp; re-entry for individuals that are convicted of a crime in which their legal status and ability to seek and maintain employment changes forever. A criminal record may prohibit individuals from successfully obtaining jobs, occupational licenses, housing and other benefits and opportunities available to all other individuals. These restrictions are often narrowly tailored and serve to protect society against an unidentified public safety risk, but others are arbitrary, unnecessary and without regard to any post-conviction rehabilitation or recovery &amp; re-entry. Individuals who have successfully completed their board-imposed sentences need to be able to reestablish themselves as law-abiding members of society. At the same time, employers and other decision-makers need to have some reassurance of a person’s reliability. Therefore, the intent and purpose of this chapter is to provide a process that would, in select and appropriate cases, allow the issuance of a certificate of recovery &amp; re-entry. Said certificate, if granted by the parole board, would serve to relieve the petitioner, in appropriate cases, of some of the collateral consequences resulting from his or her criminal record. Said certificate shall serve as one determining factor as to whether the petitioner has been successful in his or her rehabilitation.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8">The interstate compact for adult offender supervision is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state on its behalf with all jurisdictions legally joining in substantially the following form:</p>
<p class="p8"><b>ARTICLE 1</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><b>PURPOSE</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize the each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the bylaws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that congress, by enacting the crime control act, 4 U.S.C. section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states. In addition, this compact will: create a interstate commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity. The compacting states recognize that there is no “right” of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.</p>

The initial effective date shall be the latter of July 1, 2001, or upon enactment into law by the 35th jurisdiction.

<p class="p8"><b>WITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION, AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p8">Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state; provided, that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact (“withdrawing state”) by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.</p>
<p class="p8">The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.</p>
<p class="p8">The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state.</p>
<p class="p8">The interstate commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state’s intent to withdraw within sixty (60) days of its receipt thereof.</p>
<p class="p8">The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.</p>
<p class="p8">Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the interstate commission.</p>
<p class="p8">Section B. Default</p>
<p class="p8">If the interstate commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted (“defaulting state”) in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the bylaws or any duly promulgated rules the interstate commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:</p>
<p class="p8">Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the interstate commission;</p>
<p class="p8">Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the interstate commission;</p>
<p class="p8">Suspension and termination of membership in the compact. Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, chief justice or chief judicial officer of the state; the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and the state council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, interstate commission bylaws, or duly promulgated rules. The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default. The interstate commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the interstate commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension.</p>
<p class="p8">Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the interstate commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer and the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature and the state council of such termination.</p>
<p class="p8">The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.</p>
<p class="p8">The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.</p>
<p class="p8">Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the interstate commission pursuant to the rules.</p>
<p class="p8">Section C. Judicial enforcement</p>
<p class="p8">The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the Federal district where the interstate commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys’ fees.</p>
<p class="p8">Section D. Dissolution of compact</p>
<p class="p8">The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state which reduces membership in the compact to one (1) compacting state.</p>
<p class="p8">Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the interstate commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">Section A. Other laws</p>
<p class="p8">Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.</p>
<p class="p8">All compacting states’ laws conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.</p>
<p class="p8">Section B. Binding effect of the compact</p>
<p class="p8">All lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the interstate commission, are binding upon the compacting states.</p>
<p class="p8">All agreements between the interstate commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.</p>
<p class="p8">Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of interstate commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the interstate commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.</p>
<p class="p8">In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the interstate commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for an offense.

<p class="p8"><b>ARTICLE VII Entry into Force</b></p>
<p class="p8">This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two (2) states from among the states of New England. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by the state.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>ARTICLE VIII Withdrawal and Termination</b></p>
<p class="p8">This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the compact and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in the statute have been sent. The withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed under the compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, any inmates whom it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>ARTICLE IX Other Arrangements Unaffected</b></p>
<p class="p8">Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a non-party state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>ARTICLE X Construction and Severability</b></p>
<p class="p8">The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability of it to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability of it to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating in it, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> “State” means a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> “Sending state” means a state in which a prisoner is incarcerated at the time that he or she initiates a request for final disposition pursuant to article III of this agreement or at the time that a request for custody or availability is initiated pursuant to article IV.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(c)</b> “Receiving state” means the state in which trial is to be had on an indictment, information or complaint pursuant to article III or article IV.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>ARTICLE III<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment, information, or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he or she shall be brought to trial within one hundred eighty (180) days after he or she shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer’s jurisdiction written notice of the place of his or her imprisonment and his or her request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint; provided, that, for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his or her counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decision of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) of this article shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, commissioner of corrections, or other official having custody of him or her, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(c)</b> The warden, commissioner of corrections, or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him or her of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him or her and shall also inform him or her of his or her right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information, or complaint on which the detainer is based.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(d)</b> Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this article shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations, or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The warden, commissioner of corrections, or other official having custody of the prisoner shall immediately notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner’s request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner’s written notice, request, and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated by this article prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, the indictment, information, or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(e)</b> Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this article shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated by it or included in it by reason of paragraph (d) of this article, and a waiver of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon him or her, after completion of his or her term of imprisonment in the sending state. The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his or her body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(f)</b> Escape from custody by the prisoner subsequent to his or her execution of the request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) of this article shall void the request.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>ARTICLE IV<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information, or complaint is pending shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he or she has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in accordance with article V(a) of this agreement upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated: provided, that the court having jurisdiction of the indictment, information, or complaint shall have duly approved, recorded, and transmitted the request and provided further, that there shall be a period of thirty (30) days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request is honored, within which period the governor of the sending state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon his own motion or upon motion of the prisoner.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> Upon receipt of the officer’s written request as provided in paragraph (a), the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. The authorities simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons for them.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(c)</b> In respect of any proceeding made possible by this article, trial shall be commenced within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(d)</b> Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he or she may have to contest the legality of his or her delivery as provided in paragraph (a), but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered the delivery.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(e)</b> If trial is not had on any indictment, information, or complaint contemplated prior to the prisoner’s being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to article V(e), such indictment, information, or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>ARTICLE V<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> In response to a request made under article III or article IV, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall offer to deliver temporary custody of the prisoner to the appropriate authority in the state where the indictment, information, or complaint is pending against the person in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may be had. If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in article III of this agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner’s presence in federal custody at the place of trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> The officer or other representative of a state accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Proper identification and evidence of his or her authority to act for the state into whose temporary custody this prisoner is to be given.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> A duly certified copy of the indictment, information, or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged and on the basis of which the request for temporary custody of the prisoner has been made.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(c)</b> If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to accept temporary custody of the person, or in the event that an action on the indictment, information, or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in article III or article IV, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information, or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based on it shall cease to be of any force or effect.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(d)</b> The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations, or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for his or her attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at which his or her presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(e)</b> At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(f)</b> During the continuance of temporary custody or while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as required by this agreement, time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good time shall be earned by the prisoner only if, and to the extent that, the law and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may allow.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(g)</b> For all purposes other than that for which temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other manner permitted by law.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(h)</b> From the time that a party state receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until the prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending state, the state in which the one or more untried indictments, informations, or complaints are pending or in which trial is being had shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping, and returning the prisoner. The provisions of this paragraph shall govern unless the states concerned shall have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities for them.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>ARTICLE VI<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> In determining the duration and expiration dates of the time periods provided in articles III and IV of this agreement, the running of the time periods shall be tolled whenever and for as long as the prisoner is unable to stand trial, as determined by the court having jurisdiction of the matter.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> No provisions of this agreement, and no remedy made available by this agreement shall apply to any person who is adjudged to be mentally ill.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>ARTICLE VII<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8">Each state party to this agreement shall designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other party states, shall promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this agreement, and who shall provide, within and without the state, information necessary to the effective operation of this agreement.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>ARTICLE VIII<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8">This agreement shall enter into full force and effect as to a party state when the state has enacted the agreement into law. A state party to this agreement may withdraw from it by enacting a statute repealing it.

<p class="p8"><b>ARTICLE IX<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>

The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or its applicability to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and its applicability to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party to it, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions of this agreement do not become operative until the receiving state lodges a detainer based on an indictment, information or complaint with the sending state. State v. Newman, 117 R.I. 354, 367 A.2d 200, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1637 (1976).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The interstate agreement on detainers was not designed to protect against delays caused by actions of a defendant. State v. Shatney, 572 A.2d 872, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 75 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defense counsel inadvertently misrepresented the length of defendant’s sentence under proposed plea agreement, and as a result, defendant filed a motion for continuance seeking time to find new counsel, the motion was properly denied, in part, because defendant’s time in Rhode Island, due to defendant’s extradition, was limited pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 13-13-2. State v. Caprio, 819 A.2d 1265, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 82 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since proceedings could be transferred to another county, there was no absence of subject-matter jurisdiction on the part of the motion justice who heard the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 13-13-2 arguments and ruled on defendant’s contentions in respect to several cases. State v. Werner, 830 A.2d 1107, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 162 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Collateral estoppel precluded review where defendant’s claim of violation of arts. III and IV of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers had been decided adversely to defendant in various earlier appeals. State v. Werner, 865 A.2d 1049, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 4 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article III.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Federal Habeas Relief.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A delay in bringing the defendant to trial could not provide a basis for federal habeas relief since failure to comply with the time limits contained in this section was not of constitutional dimension. Lionberg v. Moran, 779 F. Supp. 672, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18800 (D.R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Speedy Trial.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Time begins to run on the 180 day period, within which trial must be brought, when the receiving state receives both the prisoner’s request for disposition and the certificate of inmate status from the sending state. State v. Moosey, 504 A.2d 1001, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 403 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s timeliness challenge under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IADA) was properly rejected as six of the nine continuances granted were attributed to defendant and the IADA was not designed to protect against delays caused by a defendant’s actions. State v. Oliver, 68 A.3d 549, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 117 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant waived his timeliness challenge under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IADA), since he did not object to the three continuances that were requested by the State and did not raise the IADA deadline during the nine continuance hearings. State v. Oliver, 68 A.3d 549, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 117 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s trial did not violate the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) because (1) the IAD did not apply after defendant’s federal sentence was served, and (2) defendant’s suppression motions caused any trial delay. State v. Tejeda, 171 A.3d 983, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 106 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article IV.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Speedy Trial.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the state was ready to prosecute well within the 120 day period specified in Article IV and the delay of the trial beyond the period was caused by the defendant, the dictates of Article IV were met. State v. Moosey, 504 A.2d 1001, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 403 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A defendant is not entitled to a dismissal on speedy trial grounds under this section where the attorney general’s department never receives the necessary forms even though the defendant has mailed them to the appropriate court. State v. Dufault, 540 A.2d 355, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 53 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court’s denial of defendant’s motion to dismiss charges against him, pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 12, based on an alleged violation of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 13-13-2, was properly denied where trials would have been commenced within the 180-day period except that continuances were required, which were found to be both necessary and reasonable, due to defendant’s demands to have new counsel appointed, to have the judge recused, and due to his uncooperativeness in returning to the State of Rhode Island; accordingly, denial of dismissal for violation of the Act and for an alleged violation of his right to a speedy trial, under R.I. Const. art. I, § 10, was proper. State v. Werner, 831 A.2d 183, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 145 (R.I. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1123, 124 S. Ct. 1083, 157 L. Ed. 2d 921, 2004 U.S. LEXIS 356 (2004).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Computation of Time.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the interstate detainers statute does not contain its own provisions concerning the computation of time for the various deadlines it prescribes, the relevant state criminal rule applies. State v. Clifton, 777 A.2d 1272, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 136 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Probation Violations.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was extradited and, upon arriving in Rhode Island, was served with a probation violation notice, notice of the probation violation was not required, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 13-13-2, art. III(d), prior to extradition, as probation violations did not come under the purview of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 13-13-1 et seq. State v. Caprio, 819 A.2d 1265, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 82 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was extradited under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 13-13-1 et seq., and once in Rhode Island, defendant was served with a probation violation notice, the Rhode Island court had jurisdiction over defendant, as, although extradition under the act was not allowed for probation violation under R.I. Gen. Laws § 13-13-2, art. III, charges independent of the probation violation led to defendant’s extradition. State v. Caprio, 819 A.2d 1265, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 82 (R.I. 2003).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>These principles are applicable to interim as well as final dispositions of children coming under the jurisdiction of the family court and they serve as adequate guidelines to govern the pre-hearing-detention determination. Morris v. D'Amario, 416 A.2d 137, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1662 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state through its power and obligation as parens patriae has both a rational and compelling interest in interference in family autonomy when these basic rights of children are violated or threatened. In re Lester, 417 A.2d 877, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1709 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state’s role in protecting children may properly be preventive of harm as well as remedial. In re Lester, 417 A.2d 877, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1709 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-2, the purpose of the family court was to strike a balance between the child’s welfare, the best interests of the State, and when possible, the conservation and strengthening of family ties; the fact that a trial justice iterated this function in a dependency and neglect proceeding was not evidence of bias in favor of the Department of Children, Youth and Families or against a father. In re Jermaine H., 9 A.3d 1227, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 114 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Children’s Rights.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A child has a fundamental interest in the security of his person, physical well-being, and access to a minimal supply of the basic necessities of life. In re Lester, 417 A.2d 877, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1709 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where no exceptional circumstances existed which would have required a natural parent to provide post-secondary education for petitioner, the family court had no authority to require the Department for Children and Their Families to do so as parens patriae. In re Debra, 445 A.2d 577, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 870 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Family Relationship.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rhode Island courts recognize the right of a family to undisturbed privacy in determining its internal arrangements, as suggested in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed. 1042 (1923); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S. Ct. 571, 69 L. Ed. 1070 (1925); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S. Ct. 1526, 32 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1972); and Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. La Fleur, 414 U.S. 632, 94 S. Ct. 791, 39 L. Ed. 2d 52 (1974). In re Lester, 417 A.2d 877, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1709 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unless the state can prove by clear and convincing evidence that a child is actually suffering or is likely to suffer physical and/or emotional harm, there is no reason to disturb the basic security of a family relationship. In re Lester, 417 A.2d 877, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1709 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jury Trial.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In situations of child neglect, dependency or abuse, the court’s approach should be three dimensional with due consideration given to the interests of the parents, the children and the state. In re Lester, 417 A.2d 877, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1709 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Appropriate Person.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Appropriate person” as defined for the purposes of §§ 14-1-10 and 14-1-11 does not include an uncle or aunt who by petition are seeking visitation privileges relating to a niece.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A child advocate, as head of an agency meeting requirements set forth in subdivision (2)(v), is an “appropriate person” for purposes of §§ 14-1-10 and 14-1-11. In re R.J.P., 445 A.2d 286 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Delinquent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By virtue of the holding in In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970), an adjudication by the family court that two juveniles were delinquent and wayward within the meaning of this section on the basis of evidence found to be “clear and convincing” of conduct which would constitute robbery and assault, was a denial of due process where a standard of proof lying somewhere between “fair preponderance” and “beyond a reasonable doubt” was applied rather than “beyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Turner, 107 R.I. 518, 268 A.2d 732, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 803 (1970).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Dependent or Neglected.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Petition under § 14-1-12 attributing neglect of child to lack of proper parental care and guardianship within definition of this section constitutes sufficient notice of the nature of the action and is not violative of procedural due process under U.S. Const., Amend. 14.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice in a neglect and/or dependency proceeding is required at least to articulate his findings in regard to the emotional and physical welfare of the child in light of the parent’s alleged misconduct.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To show dependency, the state must prove by clear and convincing evidence only that a child is actually suffering or is likely to suffer physical and/or emotional harm.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court erred in making a finding of dependency absent an amendment to the petition before her, which alleged that the mother was abusing and neglecting her children. In re Adam R., 665 A.2d 882, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 239 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the lack of housing and the need for parental aid services are not explicitly articulated in subdivision (6), those basic needs are implicitly encompassed within the statutory definition of the term “dependent.” In re Robert S., 762 A.2d 1199, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 212 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was legally sufficient clear and convincing evidence supporting a dependency finding since the father had made his children “dependent” by virtually abandoning them from the day of their births. In re Robert S., 762 A.2d 1199, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 212 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Children of a mother who had paranoid schizophrenia and denied the children toys, books, medical and dental care, and any education other than what was “revealed” to her, were properly adjudicated as dependent on the family court for protection. In re Ephraim L., 862 A.2d 196, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 205 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Children were neglected and dependent under R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-3(8) and (6) as to a father as there was evidence that the children were at risk of being harmed, based on lack of parental supervision, substance abuse, and domestic violence by and between the parents; although the father alleged there was no evidence of domestic violence, the trial justice did not believe the mother’s denials. In re Jermaine H., 9 A.3d 1227, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 114 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Clear and convincing evidence supported a trial justice’s finding that a father’s son was dependent because the father admitted using a knife to remove an extra digit from the child’s hand. In re King J., 148 A.3d 176, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 112 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Clear and convincing evidence supported a trial justice’s finding that a father’s son was dependent because (1) the son’s sibling was properly found to be dependent, and (2) the father failed to comply with a case plan and psychological evaluation, believing he did not need the plan’s services. In re King J., 148 A.3d 176, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 112 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not abuse her discretion in not allowing the father to admit the allegations of dependency. The reason for the father’s incarceration was his decision to engage in criminal activity; while prior to his incarceration, he made admirable efforts to provide for his family, he was aware of the mother’s history of alcoholism, and when her relapse occurred, only nine weeks after his initial detention, the father was not in a position to care for the child. In re Kurt H., 152 A.3d 408, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 9 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Dependency is by definition a condition involving harm or potential harm to a child that arises without fault by the parent, and if the parent’s inability to provide the child with a minimum degree of care or proper supervision is a result of the parent’s incarceration, it can hardly be argued that the parent is without fault. In re Kurt H., 152 A.3d 408, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 9 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Legally competent evidence supported the trial justice’s findings of neglect; when the child was placed in the temporary custody of the department, the father was unable to provide for the child because of his incarceration, and when the case was tried and a decision rendered, the father had made no arrangements for the child’s well-being and was unable himself to care for the child because of his incarceration. In re Kurt H., 152 A.3d 408, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 9 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Determination of Age.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Wayward Child.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a sister’s description of what her daughter told her satisfied the requirements of an excited utterance under R.I. R.

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court has jurisdiction over an indictment if the accused was over the specified age at the time the indictment was filed, even though the accused was under the age at the time of the alleged offense. Ex parte Albiniano, 62 R.I. 429, 6 A.2d 554, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 44 (1939).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The family court has exclusive jurisdiction in proceedings involving delinquent or wayward children. United States v. DiPina, 178 F.3d 68, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 10936 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to R.I. Const. art. I, § 7, dismissal of the separate cases brought against the defendants, in the Superior Court and in the District Court, respectively, would not be proper despite the fact that those courts did not have jurisdiction over the defendants because they were only 17-years-old at the time they committed the alleged offenses. Rather, the proper thing to do would be to transfer those cases to the court having exclusive original jurisdiction, which was the Family Court pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-5. State v. Greenberg, 951 A.2d 481, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 88 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Adoption.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In order to protect the best interests of the child, the decision of a placement agency to remove a child from the home of the prospective adoptive parents must be subject to judicial review, and the family court is the proper forum for such review. In re Joseph, 420 A.2d 85, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1850 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the prospective adoptive parents may not have been entitled to the permanent custody of a child prior to filing an adoption petition, the removal of the child from their care, which would have effectively foreclosed the possibility of adoption for them, constituted an injury in fact and having been thus injured, they had standing to contest that action in the family court. In re Joseph, 420 A.2d 85, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1850 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The discretion that § 14-1-35 confers on an agency as a guardian to consent to the adoption of a child placed in its custody pursuant to § 14-1-34 is not absolute; it remains subject to judicial review by the family court. In re Joseph, 420 A.2d 85, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1850 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Family Court retains jurisdiction to hear an adoption petition notwithstanding the appointment of a temporary guardian by the Probate Court. In re Jeramie N., 688 A.2d 825, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 29 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Age.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Indictment was illegal and family court had jurisdiction when indictment was based on a complaint filed and warrant issued before the accused had reached the specified age, even though the indictment was found after the accused had reached the specified age. Ex parte Albiniano, 62 R.I. 429, 6 A.2d 554, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 44 (1939).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Civil Actions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of the legislative grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the Family Court is to protect a delinquent juvenile from the adult criminal justice system, and not to shield such a juvenile from civil liability; the plaintiffs therefore were not precluded from filing a civil action in Superior Court against a juvenile defendant. Bouchard v. Price, 694 A.2d 670, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 154 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Dependency.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining the status of a child to be that of a dependent child under subsection A of this section, it is contemplated that such determination shall be made at a hearing on a petition addressed to the court alleging such dependency. In re Palmer, 100 R.I. 170, 212 A.2d 61, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 366 (1965).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Mentally Defective or Disordered.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section did not confer exclusive jurisdiction on family court where parents sought to compel department of mental health, retardation and hospitals to assume costs of treating autistic child, since the child was not “mentally defective or mentally disordered” in the meaning of the statute, such phrase applying only to those juveniles who must of necessity be institutionalized. Naughton v. Goodman, 117 R.I. 113, 363 A.2d 1345, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1606 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Paternity.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notwithstanding its apparent exclusivity, this section conferred upon the family court no broader authority in the area of paternity than had formerly been exercised by those courts to whose jurisdiction the family court succeeded upon its creation in 1961, i.e., determination of paternity only in filiation proceedings, and it was never the practice in this state that the resolution of a paternity issue arising as an incident of litigation properly within the jurisdiction of another tribunal should be deferred by that tribunal pending a referral and a determination of that issue by the family court’s predecessor. Industrial Nat'l Bank v. Isele, 108 R.I. 144, 273 A.2d 311, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1236 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Residence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>That portion of subdivision C of this section providing that either the mother or the child must have residence in the state was superseded by the 1949 amendment to § 15-8-1 (repealed, see §§ 15-8-7, 15-8-9). Surber v. Pearce, 97 R.I. 40, 195 A.2d 541, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 128 (1963).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Termination of Parental Rights.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the family court may name a placement agency as the guardian of a child after terminating the rights of the natural parents, it does not thereby surrender its jurisdiction over the child.

As part of the transition planning, the child shall be informed by the department of the opportunity to voluntarily agree to extended care and placement by the department and legal supervision by the court until age twenty-one (21). The details of a child’s transition plan shall be developed in consultation with the child, wherever possible, and approved by the court prior to the dismissal of an abuse, neglect, dependency, or miscellaneous petition before the child’s twenty-first birthday.</p>

Provided, however, the young adult may request reinstatement of responsibility and resumption of the court’s legal supervision at any time prior to his or her twenty-first birthday if the young adult meets the requirements set forth in subsection (c)(2).

<p class="p7"><b>Civil Actions.</b></p>

Upon the attainment of the individual’s twenty-first birthday, and from the point of his transfer to the ACI, all such authority passed to the Department of Corrections and the Superior Court.

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Any child who is certified shall not be eligible for release from the training school for youth unless, after hearing, the certifying judge, or the chief judge in his or her absence, or his or her designee, determines by clear and convincing evidence that the child will not pose a threat to the public during the term of the release.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> In the event that the court has modified the order of certification pursuant to § 14-1-42 by suspending the balance of the sentence imposed, any violation of the terms of the suspended sentence shall be referred to the appropriate adult court to be treated in accordance with the regular procedure of the court, unless the person is under the age of eighteen (18) years at the time of the violation, in which case, jurisdiction over the sentence shall continue in the family court.</p>

The sentence, including any term served in the training school for youth, shall be subject to the regulations and statutes governing the parole board.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Any person who commits an offense which would be punishable as a felony if committed by an adult, after having been certified and adjudicated by the family court pursuant to § 14-1-7.2, may, after a hearing by a justice of the family court to determine that probable cause exists to believe that the child has committed the offense, have the jurisdiction over his or her sentence transferred to the department of corrections to be served in facilities under the control of the department.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> A finding that the child is subject to certification shall constitute presumptive evidence of the non-amenability of the person to further treatment in facilities available to the family court and the court shall transfer the jurisdiction over his or her sentence to the department of corrections to be served in facilities under the control of the department, unless the presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence which demonstrates that the person is amenable to treatment in family court facilities.</p>

<p class="p6">In the event a child is ordered to be detained at the training school, the family court shall conduct a probable cause hearing within five (5) calendar days of the child’s detention (exclusive of weekends and/or holidays).

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Proof.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that members of the press could be excluded under this provision does not alone render it unconstitutional. Edward A. Sherman Publishing Co. v. Goldberg, 443 A.2d 1252, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 834 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is fully consonant with the right of a state to protect the confidentiality of juvenile proceedings recognized in In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1967) and Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974). Edward A. Sherman Publishing Co. v. Goldberg, 443 A.2d 1252, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 834 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is compatible with constitutional free-press guarantees because the press enjoys no greater right of access to juvenile proceedings than does the general public. Excluding the press from the category of those “with a direct interest” in these proceedings is, therefore, clearly permissible. Edward A. Sherman Publishing Co. v. Goldberg, 443 A.2d 1252, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 834 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Guardians.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the mother of an alleged dependent child is herself a minor and, therefore, not competent to employ an attorney, a guardian ad litem should be appointed to represent her at a hearing under this section. In re Palmer, 100 R.I. 170, 212 A.2d 61, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 366 (1965).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jury Trial.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Juvenile delinquency adjudications without a jury are so common to universal practice that, by inference, the legislature saw no necessity to spell out that which had always been the practice, and juvenile was not entitled to trial by jury. In re McCloud, 110 R.I. 431, 293 A.2d 512, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 933 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Media.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In situations in which the media have published, or in some other manner made public, the name of a juvenile involved in a proceeding in the family court; or when, prior to the commencement of the proceeding, the media have made known to the trial justice their intention to make such name public, the trial justice should, at the earliest possible opportunity, conduct a hearing at which representatives of the media and of the state or other local prosecuting authority shall be allowed to place on the record such evidence as the parties deem necessary concerning the source of information regarding the juvenile’s identity and the manner in which that information was obtained. Edward A. Sherman Publishing Co. v. Goldberg, 443 A.2d 1252, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 834 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a trial justice determines after a hearing that the media have learned the name of the juvenile from nonjudicial sources, as a result of their own investigations, or under similar circumstances, he shall permit the representatives of the media to report, publish, or make public the name of such juvenile and shall permit the representatives of the media to attend the hearing or proceeding in the family court. Edward A. Sherman Publishing Co. v. Goldberg, 443 A.2d 1252, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 834 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If, after a hearing, the trial justice determines that the media have learned the name of a juvenile from a judicial source or sources or that the media have learned the name of a juvenile as a result of their presence at a proceeding in the family court, he shall order that the media shall not report, publish, or otherwise make public the name of that juvenile and may also order that the media not be permitted to attend any proceedings in the family court involving that juvenile or may impose the additional sanction of exclusion from other juvenile proceedings. Edward A. Sherman Publishing Co. v. Goldberg, 443 A.2d 1252, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 834 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the state attempted to have a juvenile declared wayward or delinquent because he violated a state criminal statute, the state had to prove each and every element of the offense charged.

In deciding those matters, the chief judge or his or her designee shall consider whether the person may be incriminated, or whether the evidence may support a finding that the child is delinquent or wayward, in some other jurisdiction. After complying, and if, but for this section, he or she would have been privileged to withhold the answer given or the evidence produced by him or her, that person or child shall not be prosecuted or subjected to penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which, in accordance with the order, he gave answer or produced evidence. But he or she may, nevertheless, be prosecuted or subjected to penalty or forfeiture for any perjury, false swearing, or contempt committed in answering or failing to answer, or in producing, or failing to produce, evidence in accordance with the order.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where decree requiring wife to turn over certain property was not appealed from and could not be questioned in later appeal from finding of contempt, and where later hearing to determine punishment for contempt was terminated when trial justice learned that appeal had been taken, no appeal could be taken from the latter proceeding since there was nothing from which an appeal could be taken.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A decree ordering receivers and commissioners to appoint two appraisers for property involved in a divorce action was not reviewable. Cavanagh v. Cavanagh, 118 R.I. 608, 375 A.2d 911 (1977), but family court was without authority to order partition and sale of property while appeal was pending in Supreme Court. Cavanagh v. Cavanagh, 119 R.I. 479, 380 A.2d 964, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 2054 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Interlocutory decrees ordering the appointment of a receiver and the sale of real property were appealable to the supreme court. (See § 9-24-7). Cavanagh v. Cavanagh, 119 R.I. 479, 380 A.2d 964, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 2054 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a child’s foster parents bring an action in the family court seeking injunctive relief to prevent the department of children and their families from reuniting the child with his natural mother until there can be a hearing on their petition for adoption and the court determines that the foster parents lack standing and denies them relief, and the foster parents file an appeal, the Supreme Court will depart from its usual procedure and consider the appeal as a petition for certiorari in order to address the merits of the case, as the action of the court below has an element of finality. In re Joseph J., 465 A.2d 150, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1072 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Order modifying payments of child support was not appealable as of right. Cok v. Cok, 558 A.2d 205, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 80 (R.I. 1989); Pontbriand v. Pontbriand, 608 A.2d 658, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 285 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant’s appeal was without merit since the order appealed from is a consent order that was entered into by agreement of the parties without hearing and the terms of that order cannot be challenged in the absence of fraud, mutual mistake, or actual absence of consent. Hasman v. Hasman, 655 A.2d 256, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 70 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since subsection (b) clearly provides that review of a Family Court decision is solely by petition for writ of certiorari, an appeal taken from a Family Court judgment is improper.

<p class="p7"><b>Certiorari.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the way to obtain review of an order granting a preliminary injunction entered in the superior court was by appeal within 20 days following entry, where third-party defendants in a divorce action filed a petition for certiorari to obtain such a review, the petition would be read as if it were a claim of appeal since it was claimed within the 20-day time limit. Johnson v. Johnson, 111 R.I. 46, 298 A.2d 795, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1177 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The proper way to seek review of a decree or order of the family court relating to modification of child support is to petition the Supreme Court for writ of certiorari pursuant to subsection (b). Meehan v. Meehan, 603 A.2d 333, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 39 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the case should properly have been by petition for writ of certiorari because an order that modifies child support is not appealable, the defendant’s appeal was interpreted as a common law writ of certiorari. Lentz v. Lentz, 651 A.2d 1242, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 310 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The issue of whether a party was in contempt of an alimony provision of a final divorce judgment, and whether a court erred in denying a reinstatement of alimony, is reviewable only by certiorari and an appeal will be denied on procedural grounds. Armentrout v. Armentrout, 675 A.2d 415, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 128 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although this statute does not explicitly state that a denial of a contempt motion falls within the purview of the required procedure under this provision, the words “relating to” modify the words “finding of contempt,” irrespective of whether a finding of contempt was actually made, and thus review may be sought only by a petition for certiorari. Poisson v. Bergeron, 743 A.2d 1037, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 10 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The father failed to demonstrate the exigency that qualified as an exception to R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-52(b) (1956), and his failure to purge the contempt also provides an independent basis for denying review. Codd v. Barrett, 798 A.2d 954, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 163 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Orders modifying child support are reviewed by writ of certiorari, not appeal, even when such orders have been bundled with other issues; only in extreme circumstances will the court depart from this procedure. Africano v. Castelli, 837 A.2d 721, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 234 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Father’s pro se, direct appeal filed in the state supreme court of the family court’s order denying the father’s motion to modify a child support order had to be denied and the family court’s order had to be affirmed; the proper procedure for reviewing questions involving the modification of child support were not reviewable by direct appeal, but instead required that a party file, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-52(b), a petition for writ of certiorari in the state supreme court and the father’s case did not present the rare circumstance where the failure to file the R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-52(b) petition would be allowed. Fischer v. Walker, 874 A.2d 737, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 115 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Wife’s appeal of the trial court’s denial of her motion for attorney’s fees in her contempt action against her husband was improper because, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-52(b) such orders were reviewable only by a petition for a writ of certiorari, and the wife sought review by appeal; the request for attorney’s fees could not have been detached from the denial of her motion to find the husband in contempt. Kashmanian v. Kashmanian, 924 A.2d 2, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 57 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-52(b), a petition for certiorari was the only proper vehicle for bringing the father’s claims where although he was never adjudged in contempt, the father’s appeals clearly resulted from the mother’s filing for contempt.14-1-52 DeCesare v. Delfarno, 112 A.3d 714, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 52 (R.I. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though a father’s motion was styled as a motion for credit for the Social Security Disability Insurance benefits received by the mother, it was in fact a motion to modify the amount of child support he was obligated to pay where the father was aware that the mother was receiving those benefits at the time the parties agreed on child support. Since matters related to the modification of child support are not appealable and the father had not filed a petition for a writ of certiorari as required by R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-52(b), the appeal was not properly before the court. Evans v. Evans, 226 A.3d 135, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 22 (R.I. 2020).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction of Family Court During Appeal.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the object of the appeal was to secure the real estate, the family court’s order to sell the property outright did not constitute administration of the property during the pendency of the appeal and was improper. Cavanagh v. Cavanagh, 119 R.I. 479, 380 A.2d 964, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 2054 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the papers of an action concerning partition of real estate were transmitted to the supreme court and the appeal had been docketed, the family court was without authority to act on motions to sell the real estate and the decrees ordering sale were therefore void. Cavanagh v. Cavanagh, 119 R.I. 479, 380 A.2d 964, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 2054 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Procedure.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there is an appeal under this section from the family court, the appellate procedure for causes in equity must be followed and the supreme court will review the decree appealed from, not the decision of the trial justice; the ultimate findings of fact on which the decree is based should be incorporated therein and in the absence of such findings the supreme court must examine the decision of the family court to determine whether the findings are supported by the evidence and whether the decree is warranted by the facts established and the applicable law. Culpepper v. Martins, 96 R.I. 328, 191 A.2d 285, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 92 (1963).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Alleged error of the family court in adjudicating a respondent a delinquent and wayward child could not be reviewed without a transcript of the evidence adduced at the hearing, which transcript it was incumbent upon the appealing respondent to bring up. State v. Cook, 99 R.I. 710, 210 A.2d 577, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 506 (1965).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The appropriate procedure for review of a decree of a family court is by appeal and not by bill of exceptions. In re Loudin, 101 R.I. 35, 219 A.2d 915, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 347 (1966); Burns v. Burns, 102 R.I. 183, 229 A.2d 294, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 668 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Father chose the wrong procedural vehicle to bring his claim before the Supreme Court because he did not bring his case by a petition for certiorari as required by subsection (b) of this section but instead chose to seek review by appeal; although the family court’s order did not explicitly find the father in willful contempt, the order nevertheless resulted from the mother’s motion to adjudicate the father as in contempt. Lahoud v. Carvalho, 143 A.3d 1077, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 44 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Timeliness.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the rule requiring the filing of a notice of appeal is mandatory, plaintiff’s notice of appeal from a divorce decree was untimely since it was not filed until more than three months after the entry of the decision and since no mention was made of excusable neglect.

<p class="p7"><b>Acceptable Hearsay.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section eliminated the requirement that the declarant must have been “laboring under the stress of nervous excitement” when the statement was made; to ensure reliability, the lawmakers instead required that the hearsay statement must have been made to someone the child would normally turn to for sympathy, protection, or advice. In re Deborah M., 544 A.2d 572, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 95 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a child’s statement is made spontaneously, within a reasonable time after the act is alleged to have occurred, and is made to someone the child would normally turn to for sympathy, protection or advice, that statement is within the realm of this section.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The crucial requirement under this section is that the person to whom the statement is made must be someone the child would normally turn to for protection. This section does not require that this person be previously known to the speaker. A physician occupies such a position of trust, even though he or she may be previously unknown to his or her patient. In re NE-KIA S., 566 A.2d 392, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 157 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— “Spontaneity” Defined.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section in no way requires that a statement must be initiated by the declarant in order to be spontaneous. The fact that a statement was made in response to an inquiry does not render the statement inadmissible. In re NE-KIA S., 566 A.2d 392, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 157 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Competency of Child.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not require that the child be found competent before his statement can be admitted into evidence.

<p class="p7"><b>Physical Abuse.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In situations in which physical abuse alone is alleged, the resulting trauma to a child is not to such a degree less than the trauma attendant to sexual abuse, such that this section should not apply. In re NE-KIA S., 566 A.2d 392, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 157 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a proceeding for termination of parental rights, any error in admission of the testimony of a sexual-abuse therapist as to statements of a child that her father had physically abused both her and her sister did not prejudice the parents since they were absolved of sexual abuse, and there was ample independent, competent evidence to prove that the children had suffered physical abuse. In re Nicole B., 703 A.2d 612, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 314 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Reasonable Time.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a child stated that she told her mother about the assaults by her mother’s boyfriend and also reported that her mother responded with indifference and instructed her not to disclose his wrongdoing to the department of children and their families, in light of the facts presented, the passing of four days between the date of the assault and its disclosure represents a reasonable interval. In re Deborah M., 544 A.2d 572, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 95 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A child’s statements are both timely and spontaneous within the standards of this section, where such statements are made to her foster mother within three days of being placed in foster care, a reasonable time from when she was removed from the scene of her sexual abuse. In re Jean Marie W., 559 A.2d 625, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 102 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Statements made by a child to a social worker and Department of Children, Youth and Families investigator approximately six months after he had been removed from the home where the alleged abuses occurred were not made spontaneously within a reasonable time. In re Rocco W., 706 A.2d 1302, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 8 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Relaxed Standards Applicable.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The relaxed standards of spontaneity and timeliness apply to hearsay proffered under this section, which liberalized the common-law test for admission of children’s out-of-court statements concerning their physical abuse. In re Deborah M., 544 A.2d 572, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 95 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Specific Cases.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because of the significant lapse of time between the taking of the children into custody and the allegations of abuse, the ample opportunity for reflection and deliberation given the children, and numerous previous disclosures about abuse against others, the allegations of abuse against the parents may not have been made spontaneously or at the children’s fist safe opportunity to disclose the abuse, and thus the spontaneity and timeliness requirements of this section were not met. In re Jessica C., 690 A.2d 1357, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 79 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice correctly allowed a nurse practitioner, a school nurse, and a school social worker to testify concerning various out-of-court statements made by a child when it was apparent that the child turned to these adults for sympathy, protection, or advice. In re Veronica T., 700 A.2d 1366, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 268 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a termination of parental rights action, the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay testimony of the child’s foster mother, in which the child indicated that the mother had hit the child, as the statement was made three months after the child began living with the foster mother; however, reversal was not required because the trial justice’s decision to terminate the mother’s parental rights was not based upon the abuse allegedly inflicted by the mother, but rather upon the mother’ failure to protect the child from the father’s abuse. In re Alexis L., 972 A.2d 159, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 74 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a mother appealed a family court’s termination of her parental rights under several sections of R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-7-7 and she argued that the trial justice committed reversible error because he permitted witnesses to testify about hearsay statements made by the children under R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-69 due to the passage of time, it was clear, without question, that the children’s hearsay statements were not necessary for the trial justice to determine that abuse had occurred or that a termination of parental rights was appropriate. In re Rita F., 64 A.3d 1220, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 78 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a case where the family court found that the father abused and neglected his daughters, the older child’s statements to her former preschool teacher indicating that the younger child had told her that their mother had coached the younger child into making sexual abuse accusations by showing her a pornographic movie did not fit within the hearsay exception provided by this section. The older child’s statements related to the alleged motive underlying the younger child’s disclosures and were properly stricken as inadmissible hearsay; the statements were not statements of abuse made to a trusted adult as they were statements that the younger child’s accusations were fabricated; and, in any event, any purported error was harmless as the rejected testimony was cumulative of admitted testimony.

<p class="p6"><b>The Interstate Compact on Juveniles</b></p>
<p class="p6">The contracting states solemnly agree:</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE I PURPOSE</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. § 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.</p>
<p class="p6">It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to: (1) ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state; (2) ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected; (3) return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return; (4) make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services; (5) provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles; (6) equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states; (7) establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders; (8) insure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; (9) establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact; (10) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators; (11) monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; (12) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and (13) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the interstate compact for the placement of children, the interstate compact for adult offender supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The governor on behalf of the state of Rhode Island is authorized to execute a compact, in substantially the following form, with any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the general assembly signifies in advance its approval and ratification of this compact:</p>
<p class="p6">Interstate Compact on Juveniles</p>
<p class="p6">The contracting states solemnly agree:</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE I</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Findings and Purposes</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">That juveniles who are not under proper supervision and control, or who have absconded, escaped or run away, are likely to endanger their own health, morals and welfare, and the health morals and welfare of others. The cooperation of the states party to this compact is therefore necessary to provide for the welfare and protection of juveniles and of the public with respect to: (1) cooperative supervision of delinquent juveniles on probation or parole; (2) the return, from one state to another, of delinquent juveniles who have escaped or absconded; (3) the return, from one state to another, of non-delinquent juveniles who have run away from home; and (4) additional measures for the protection of juveniles and of the public, which any two (2) or more of the party states may find desirable to undertake cooperatively. In carrying out the provisions of this compact the party states shall be guided by the non-criminal, reformative and protective polices [policies] which guide their laws concerning delinquent, neglected or dependent juveniles generally. It shall be the policy of the states party to this compact to cooperate and observe their respective responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles and delinquent juveniles who become subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes of Article I of this compact.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE II</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Existing Rights and Remedies</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">That all remedies and procedures provided by this compact shall be in addition to and not in substitution for other rights, remedies and procedures, and shall not be in derogation of parental rights and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE III</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Definitions</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">That, for the purposes of this compact, “delinquent juvenile” means any juvenile who has been adjudged delinquent and who, at the time the provisions of this compact are invoked, is still subject to the jurisdiction of the court that has made that adjudication or to the jurisdiction or supervision of an agency or institution pursuant to an order of the court; “probation or parole” means any kind of conditional release of juveniles authorized under the laws of the states party to the compact; “court” means any court having jurisdiction over delinquent, neglected or dependent children; “state” means any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; and “residence” or any variant of it means a place at which a home or regular place of abode is maintained.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE IV</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Return of Runaways</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> That the parent, guardian, person or agency entitled to legal custody of a juvenile who has not been adjudged delinquent but who has run away without the consent of the parent, guardian, person or agency may petition the appropriate court in the demanding state for the issuance of a requisition for his or her return. The petition shall state the name and age of the juvenile, the name of the petitioner and the basis of entitlement to the juvenile’s custody, the circumstances of his or her running away, his location if known at the time application is made, and any other facts that may tend to show that the juvenile who has run away is endangering his or her own welfare or the welfare of others and is not an emancipated minor. The petition shall be verified by affidavit, shall be executed in duplicate, and shall be accompanied by two (2) certified copies of the document or documents on which the petitioner’s entitlement to the juvenile’s custody is base [based], such as birth certificates, letters of guardianship, or custody decrees. Any further affidavits and other documents that may be deemed proper may be submitted with the petition. The judge of the court to which this application is made may hold a hearing on it to determine whether for the purposes of this compact the petitioner is entitled to the legal custody of the juvenile, whether or not it appears that the juvenile has in fact run away without consent, whether or not he or she is an emancipated minor, and whether or not it is in the best interest of the juvenile to compel his or her return to the state. If the judge determines, either with or without a hearing, that the juvenile should be returned, he or she shall present to the appropriate court or to the executive authority of the state where the juvenile is alleged to be located a written requisition for the return of the juvenile. The requisition shall set forth the name and age of the juvenile, the determination of the court that the juvenile has run away without the consent of a parent, guardian, person or agency entitled to his or her legal custody, and that it is in the best interest and for the protection of the juvenile that he or she be returned. In the event that a proceeding for the adjudication of the juvenile as a delinquent, neglected or dependent juvenile is pending in the court at the time when the juvenile runs away, the court may issue a requisition for the return of the juvenile upon its own motion, regardless of the consent of the parent, guardian, person or agency entitled to legal custody, reciting in it the nature and circumstances of the pending proceeding. The requisition shall in every case be executed in duplicate and shall be signed by the judge. One copy of the requisition shall be filed with the compact administrator of the demanding state, there to remain on file subject to the provisions of law governing records of such court. Upon the receipt of a requisition demanding the return of a juvenile who has run away, the court or the executive authority to whom the requisition is addressed shall issue an order to any peace officer or other appropriate person directing him to take into custody and detain the juvenile. The detention order must substantially recite the facts necessary to the validity of its issuance under this article. No juvenile detained upon the order shall be delivered over to the officer whom the court demanding him or her shall have appointed to receive him or her, unless he or she shall first be taken immediately before a judge of a court in the state, who shall inform him or her of the demand made for his or her return, and who may appoint counsel or guardian ad litem for him or her. If the judge of the court shall find that the requisition is in order, he or she shall deliver the juvenile over to the officer whom the court demanding him or her shall have appointed to receive him or her. The judge, however, may fix a reasonable time to be allowed for the purpose of testing the legality of the proceeding. Upon reasonable information that a person is a juvenile who has run away from another state party to this compact without consent of a parent, guardian, person or agency entitled to his or her legal custody, the juvenile, consistent with section 14-1-26.1, may be taken into custody without a requisition and brought immediately before a judge of the appropriate court who may appoint counsel or guardian ad litem for the juvenile and who shall determine after a hearing whether sufficient cause exists to hold the person, subject to the order of the court, for his or her own protection and welfare, for a time not exceeding ninety (90) days that will enable his or her return to another state party to this compact pursuant to the requisition for his or her return from a court of that state. If, at the time when a state seeks the return of a juvenile who has run away, there is pending in the state in which he or she is found any criminal charge, or any proceeding to have him or her adjudicated a delinquent juvenile for an act committed in that state, or if he or she is suspected of having committed within that state a criminal offense or an act of juvenile delinquency, he or she shall not be returned without the consent of that state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment, detention or supervision for the offense or juvenile delinquency. The duly accredited officers of any state party to this compact, upon the establishment of their authority and the identity of the juvenile being returned, shall be permitted to transport the juvenile through any and all states party to this compact without interference. Upon his or her return to the state from which he or she ran away, the juvenile shall be subject to any further proceedings that may be appropriate under the laws of that state.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> That the state to which a juvenile is returned under this article shall be responsible for payment of the transportation costs of that return.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> That “juvenile” as used in this article means any person who is a minor under the law of the state of residence of the parent, guardian, person or agency entitled to the legal custody of the minor.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE V</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Return of Escapees and Absconders</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> That the appropriate person or authority from whose probation or parole supervision a delinquent juvenile has absconded or from whose institutional custody he or she has escaped shall present to the appropriate court or to the executive authority of the state where the delinquent juvenile is alleged to be located a written requisition for the return of the delinquent juvenile. The requisition shall state the name and age of the delinquent juvenile, the particulars of his or her adjudication as a delinquent juvenile, the circumstances of the breach of the terms of his or her probation or parole or of his or her escape from an institution or agency vested with his or her legal custody or supervision, and the location of the delinquent juvenile, if known, at the time the requisition is made. The requisition shall be verified by affidavit, shall be executed in duplicate, and shall be accompanied by two (2) certified copies of the judgment, formal adjudication, or order of commitment which subjects the delinquent juvenile to probation or parole or to the legal custody of the institution or agency concerned. Any further affidavits and other documents that may be deemed proper may be submitted with the requisition. One copy of the requisition shall be filed with the compact administrator of the demanding state, there to remain on file subject to the provisions of law governing records of the appropriate court. Upon the receipt of a requisition demanding the return of a delinquent juvenile who has absconded or escaped, the court or the executive authority to whom the requisition is addressed shall issue an order to any peace officer or other appropriate person directing him or her to take into custody and detain the delinquent juvenile. The detention order must substantially recite the facts necessary to the validity of its issuance under this article. No delinquent juvenile detained upon the order shall be delivered over to the officer whom the appropriate person or authority demanding him or her shall have appointed to receive him or her, unless he or she shall first be taken immediately before a judge of an appropriate court in the state, who shall inform him or her of the demand made for his or her return and who may appoint counsel or guardian ad litem for him or her. If the judge of the court shall find that the requisition is in order, he or she shall deliver the delinquent juvenile over to the officer whom the appropriate person or authority demanding him or her shall have appointed to receive him or her. The judge, however, may fix a reasonable time to be allowed for the purpose of testing the legality of the proceeding. Upon reasonable information that a person is a delinquent juvenile who has absconded while on probation or parole, or escaped from an institution or agency vested with his or her legal custody or supervision in any state party to this compact, the person may be taken into custody in any other state party to this compact without a requisition. But in that event, he or she must be taken immediately before a judge of the appropriate court, who may appoint counsel or guardian ad litem for the person and who shall determine, after a hearing, whether sufficient cause exists to hold the person subject to the order of the court for a time, not exceeding ninety (90) days, as will enable his or her detention under a detention order issued on a requisition pursuant to this article. If, at the time when a state seeks the return of a delinquent juvenile who has either absconded while on probation or parole or escaped from an institution or agency vested with his or her legal custody or supervision, there is pending in the state in which he or she is detained any criminal charge or any proceeding to have him or her adjudicated a delinquent juvenile for an act committed in the state, or if he or she is suspected of having committed within the state a criminal offense or an act of juvenile delinquency, he or she shall not be returned without the consent of the state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment, detention or supervision for the offense or juvenile delinquency. The duly accredited officers of any state party to this compact, upon the establishment of their authority and the identity of the delinquent juvenile being returned, shall be permitted to transport the delinquent juvenile through any and all states party to this compact, without interference. Upon his or her return to the state from which he or she escaped or absconded, the delinquent juvenile shall be subject to any further proceedings that may be appropriate under the laws of that state.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> That the state to which a delinquent juvenile is returned under this article shall be responsible for payment of the transportation costs of the return.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE VI</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Voluntary Return Procedure</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">That any delinquent juvenile who has absconded while on probation or parole, or escaped from an institution or agency vested with his or her legal custody or supervision in any state party to this compact, and any juvenile who has run away from any state party to this compact, who is taken into custody without a requisition in another state party to this compact under the provisions of article IV(a) or of article V(a), may consent to his or her immediate return to the state from which he or she absconded, escaped or ran away. Consent shall be given by the juvenile or delinquent juvenile and his or her counsel or guardian ad litem if any, by executing or subscribing a writing, in the presence of a judge of the appropriate court, which states that the juvenile or delinquent juvenile and his or her counsel or guardian ad litem, if any, consent to his or her return to the demanding state. Before the consent shall be executed or subscribed, however, the judge, in the presence of counsel or guardian ad litem, if any, shall inform the juvenile or delinquent juvenile of his or her rights under this compact. When the consent has been duly executed, it shall be forwarded to and filed with the compact administrator of the state in which the court is located and the judge shall direct the officer having the juvenile or delinquent juvenile in custody to deliver his [him] or her to the duly accredited officer or officers of the state demanding his or her return, and shall cause to be delivered to that officer or officers a copy of the consent. The court may, however, upon the request of the state to which the juvenile or delinquent juvenile is being returned, order him or her to return unaccompanied to the state and shall provide him or her with a copy of the court order; in that event a copy of the consent shall be forwarded to the compact administrator of the state to which the juvenile or delinquent juvenile is ordered to return.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> That the duly constituted judicial and administrative authorities of a state party to this compact (called “sending state”) may permit any delinquent juvenile within the state, placed on probation or parole, to reside in any other state party to this compact (called “receiving state”) while on probation or parole, and receiving state shall accept the delinquent juvenile, if the parent, guardian or person entitled to the legal custody of the delinquent juvenile is residing or undertakes to reside within the receiving state. Before granting permission, opportunity shall be given to the receiving state to make any investigations that it deems necessary. The authorities of the sending state shall send to the authorities of the receiving state copies of pertinent court orders, social case studies and all other available information which may be of value to and assist the receiving state in supervising a probationer or parolee under this compact. A receiving state, in its discretion, may agree to accept supervision of a probationer or parolee in cases where the parent, guardian or person entitled to the legal custody of the delinquent juvenile is not a resident of the receiving state, and if so accepted the sending state may transfer supervision accordingly.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> That each receiving state will assume the duties of visitation and of supervision over any delinquent juvenile and in the exercise of those duties will be governed by the same standards of visitation and supervision that prevail for its own delinquent juveniles released on probation or parole.</p>

For that purpose, no formalities will be required, other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the delinquent juvenile to be retaken and returned. The decision of the sending state to retake a delinquent juvenile on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to retake a delinquent juvenile on probation or parole, there is pending against him or her within the receiving state any criminal charge or any proceeding to have him or her adjudicated a delinquent juvenile for any act committed in the state, or if he or she is suspected of having committed within the state a criminal offense or an act of juvenile delinquency, he or she shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharge from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment, detention or supervision for such offense or juvenile delinquency.

The decree may be entered at the discretion of the court upon the petition of either party to the marriage, or of any of the issue of the marriage, and after a hearing and notice to all persons known to have an interest in the marriage as the court may deem necessary, and the decree may declare that the issue of the marriage shall be deemed legitimate and that the widow of any party to the marriage shall be entitled to her life estate created by chapter 25 of title 33.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A petition for the annulment of a marriage on the ground that it was originally void was entitled to an allowance pending determination of the suit, since such proceeding was by the statute classed as one for divorce.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The acceptance of uncontroverted evidence of sterility as the basis for inference of sterility having existed at the time of conception which occurred two months prior to the medical examination establishing the fact of sterility, was deemed to require inference of sterility during the time of an earlier conception, where uncontroverted testimony of a bout with orchitis prior to the time of the earlier conception was before the court. Milliken v. Milliken, 120 R.I. 762, 390 A.2d 934, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 724 (1978).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Condonation of Offense.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The act of the petitioner in returning to her husband’s home for three days after swearing to petitions did not amount to condonation where no act of sexual intercourse occurred and the petitioner intended to leave and did leave as soon as citations were served on the husband. Sayles v. Sayles, 41 R.I. 170, 103 A. 225 (1918).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where after separation because of the husband’s acts of cruelty the parties resumed relations, but the husband’s conduct was unchanged and the wife again left him, the resumption of relations did not bar an action for divorce as the condonation was conditional and was forfeited by the further misconduct. Grant v. Grant, 44 R.I. 169, 116 A. 481, 1922 R.I. LEXIS 23 (1922).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Continued Drunkenness.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The words “continued drunkenness” are used in their ordinary sense and signify gross and confirmed habits of intoxication. Gourlay v. Gourlay, 16 R.I. 705, 19 A. 142, 1890 R.I. LEXIS 1 (1890); Bevan v. Bevan, 44 R.I. 12, 114 A. 130, 1921 R.I. LEXIS 35 (1921).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Proof of continued drunkenness must be sufficiently clear to convince the court that habits of drunkenness were confirmed and continued. Gourlay v. Gourlay, 16 R.I. 705, 19 A. 142, 1890 R.I. LEXIS 1 (1890); Bevan v. Bevan, 44 R.I. 12, 114 A. 130, 1921 R.I. LEXIS 35 (1921).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An occasional abuse in the use of alcohol does not constitute continued drunkenness. Bevan v. Bevan, 44 R.I. 12, 114 A. 130, 1921 R.I. LEXIS 35 (1921).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Intoxication on three Sundays out of four, and occasionally the preceding Saturday afternoons, for a period of four and one-half months did not constitute continued drunkenness. Wright v. Wright, 47 R.I. 114, 131 A. 81, 1925 R.I. LEXIS 76 (1925).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Extreme Cruelty.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Similar acts or conduct under different circumstances may or may not amount to cruelty, as much depends on the intention of the parties, the results which follow, and the habits and customs which are common to husband and wife. Grant v. Grant, 44 R.I. 169, 116 A. 481, 1922 R.I. LEXIS 23 (1922).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Acts by a husband designed to cause distress to his wife with the apparent expectation that he would be able to coerce her to live and act in every way according to his wish and will and the creation by the husband by his own wrongful acts of a situation where it was impossible for the wife to continue to live with him without real and serious danger to her health sustained a charge of extreme cruelty even without evidence of actual physical violence. Grant v. Grant, 44 R.I. 169, 116 A. 481, 1922 R.I. LEXIS 23 (1922).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A course of conduct, wilfully and maliciously persisted in, which naturally caused in the wife a wretchedness of mind affecting her health and made it impossible to longer endure conjugal relations with her husband warranted a finding of extreme cruelty without evidence of physical violence. Borda v. Borda, 44 R.I. 337, 117 A. 362, 1922 R.I. LEXIS 48 (1922).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Disregard, unconcern and neglect not resulting in impairment of the health of the injured party do not amount to extreme cruelty. McKeon v. McKeon, 54 R.I. 163, 170 A. 922, 1934 R.I. LEXIS 26 (1934); Bastien v. Bastien, 57 R.I. 176, 189 A. 37, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 89 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A wife’s statement reflecting on the paternity of her unborn child, as well as her admission of intimacy with another man, although calculated to cause mental anguish, did not amount to extreme cruelty without evidence that such mental anguish caused any impairment of health or would inevitably cause such impairment. Bastien v. Bastien, 57 R.I. 176, 189 A. 37, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 89 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Extreme cruelty is limited to physical cruelty, but such cruelty is not confined to acts of physical violence or threats and may result from acts or course of conduct totally devoid of any element of physical injury or threat thereof, as the effect of such conduct and not the conduct itself constitutes the basis for the charge. Bastien v. Bastien, 57 R.I. 176, 189 A. 37, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 89 (1937). See also Grant v. Grant, 44 R.I. 169, 116 A. 481, 1922 R.I. LEXIS 23 (1922); Borda v. Borda, 44 R.I. 337, 117 A. 362, 1922 R.I. LEXIS 48 (1922).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mere refusal to indulge in normal sexual intercourse was not extreme cruelty. Santos v. Santos, 80 R.I. 5, 90 A.2d 771, 1952 R.I. LEXIS 2 (1952).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To prove extreme cruelty without physical force but on mental grounds, the evidence must establish conduct or acts of cruelty which are intentional and result in the impairment of mental and physical health of the complaining party. Santos v. Santos, 80 R.I. 5, 90 A.2d 771, 1952 R.I. LEXIS 2 (1952).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court will grant an absolute divorce on the grounds of extreme cruelty either where the respondent spouse has been guilty of physical violence or where, when guiltless of physical violence, such spouse has pursued a willful course of conduct that has impaired the health of the offending spouse. Winslow v. Winslow, 90 R.I. 146, 155 A.2d 852, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 127 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Sufficiency of Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sufficiency of evidence to prove extreme cruelty was a question of fact, and the trial justice’s finding would not be disturbed unless clearly wrong. Sullivan v. Sullivan, 68 R.I. 25, 26 A.2d 536, 1942 R.I. LEXIS 35 (1942).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Extreme cruelty was not proved by vague and general evidence of cruelty without any resulting substantial injury. Jackson v. Jackson, 70 R.I. 333, 38 A.2d 637, 1944 R.I. LEXIS 49 (1944).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A divorce on the ground of extreme cruelty when not resulting from physical violence will not be granted except upon clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner was without fault and that the alleged conduct or acts of cruelty were deliberate, intentional and calculated to cause, and which did in fact cause, an impairment of health of the petitioning party or which would inevitably result in such impairment if the course of conduct complained of continued. Miller v. Miller, 87 R.I. 145, 139 A.2d 86, 1958 R.I. LEXIS 28 (1958).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The petitioner husband in his action for divorce on the ground of extreme cruelty under which a petitioner cannot prevail unless he establishes by affirmative and convincing evidence that he is without fault, did not make such proof, where the evidence showed that he went out socially with another woman which aggravated his wife’s conduct toward him, she making his home life so unpleasant that he sought companionship elsewhere. Harwood v. Harwood, 94 R.I. 165, 179 A.2d 317, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 46 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Gross Misbehavior and Wickedness.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the husband left his wife and lived for a year with another woman, it was not such gross misconduct as to justify divorce when it is considered that the statute requires a five-year period of desertion. Stevens v. Stevens, 8 R.I. 557, 1867 R.I. LEXIS 18 (1867).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To make the conduct of a respondent a ground for divorce under the gross misbehavior and wickedness clause, such conduct should have some character of licentiousness or brutality allying it in its attributes with adultery or extreme cruelty. Stevens v. Stevens, 8 R.I. 557, 1867 R.I. LEXIS 18 (1867); Walker v. Walker, 38 R.I. 362, 95 A. 925, 1915 R.I. LEXIS 78 (1915); Rainey v. Rainey, 57 R.I. 426, 190 A. 27, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 104 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the trial court held the husband guilty of misbehavior and wickedness repugnant to and inconsistent with the marriage covenant, it was incumbent upon the husband upon appeal to show that the inference of the trial court was unwarranted. Rainey v. Rainey, 57 R.I. 426, 190 A. 27, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 104 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mere suspicion that the wife sought sexual relationship with members of her own sex did not prove gross misbehavior and wickedness. Santos v. Santos, 80 R.I. 5, 90 A.2d 771, 1952 R.I. LEXIS 2 (1952).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In case of misbehavior in association with another woman, there must be some character of licentiousness in order to prove gross misbehavior and wickedness. Thomas v. Thomas, 83 R.I. 251, 115 A.2d 526, 1955 R.I. LEXIS 51 (1955).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, in a complaint and cross complaint, both parties allege gross misbehavior, the guilt of the parties will bar granting of the decree after introduction of evidence of such guilt. Botelho v. Botelho, 96 R.I. 379, 192 A.2d 5, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 99 (1963).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Neglect and Refusal to Provide.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the period during which a husband failed to provide terminated 14 months prior to the filing of the petition, there was no ground for divorce. Hurvitz v. Hurvitz, 44 R.I. 478, 119 A. 58, 1922 R.I. LEXIS 79 (1922).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court could not say that the trial justice was clearly wrong in denying a petition where the evidence of neglect to provide did not relate to the year next preceding the filing of a petition but to a time considerably before such period. Blatchford v. Blatchford, 67 R.I. 24, 20 A.2d 539, 1941 R.I. LEXIS 69 (1941).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Neglect to provide must exist for one year prior to the filing of a petition. Lister v. Lister, 82 R.I. 93, 106 A.2d 258, 1954 R.I. LEXIS 16 (1954).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Neglect by the husband for a period of 11 years to send funds for support for the couple’s six children, though he knew the wife’s residence and was gainfully employed, entitled the wife to divorce from bed and board. Nardolillo v. Nardolillo, 84 R.I. 250, 123 A.2d 141, 1956 R.I. LEXIS 54 (1956).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Ability to Provide.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This statute does not deprive females of the equal protection of the law since it grants to husbands and wives alike the power to seek the dissolution of their matrimonial bonds upon proof that they have been living separate and apart from their respective spouses three years or more. Harwood v. Harwood, 120 R.I. 145, 385 A.2d 1055, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 645 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This statute does not violate the Rhode Island Const., Art. VI, Sec. 2, which prohibits the delegation of legislative power to private parties unless accompanied by adequate legislative standards, since the statute simply sets forth as grounds for an absolute divorce the fact that the parties have been living separate and apart for three years, and the fact that the statute requires the Family Court to enter a decree terminating the marriage of the parties once it finds the criteria have been satisfied does not constitute a delegation of the police power. Harwood v. Harwood, 120 R.I. 145, 385 A.2d 1055, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 645 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Alimony.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Alimony could not be awarded in granting a husband’s petition under this section where the wife was 49 years old, had a net income of $630 per year and free occupation of an apartment, whereas the husband was over 60 years old, earned from $27.00 to $30.00 per week, and suffered from a disease which would probably necessitate retirement at a much lower income. Meegan v. Meegan, 67 R.I. 205, 21 A.2d 573, 1941 R.I. LEXIS 97 (1941).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, after the parties had lived apart for the required number of years under a separation agreement in which the wife released the husband from all obligation for her support for the remainder of her life, an order granting ten dollars a week alimony to the wife as part of a decree awarding a divorce to the husband ripened into a judgment with the passing of each week in the absence of an appeal therefrom. Pires v. Pires, 102 R.I. 23, 227 A.2d 477, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 638 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Basis for Divorce.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The basis for divorce under this section is not the wrongdoing of one of the parties but is public policy, as a failure to reconcile justifies not compelling them to remain in a marital status. McKenna v. McKenna, 53 R.I. 373, 166 A. 822, 1933 R.I. LEXIS 105 (1933).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Conduct of Petitioner.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Testimony of recrimination was admissible to aid the court in the exercise of its discretion but not as a defense, as divorce under this section does not depend on the previous conduct of the petitioner. Guillot v. Guillot, 42 R.I. 230, 106 A. 801, 1919 R.I. LEXIS 26 (1919).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The good or bad conduct of the petitioner is not decisive. Smith v. Smith, 54 R.I. 236, 172 A. 323, 1934 R.I. LEXIS 52 (1934).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Discretion was not abused in denying a divorce where the original separation was by the petitioner’s desertion, he had concealed his whereabouts during the entire period of separation, and there was suspicion of misconduct during such period. Nardolillo v. Nardolillo, 84 R.I. 250, 123 A.2d 141, 1956 R.I. LEXIS 54 (1956).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Grounds for Divorce.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Divorce a mensa et thoro could be granted where the conduct of the husband over a long period, though not amounting to adultery, had such a character of licentiousness that such conduct was like adultery in kind.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions giving the court discretion to grant divorces from bed and board “for such other causes as may seem to require the same” refers to causes which, if not equal in enormity, yet are like in kind with the offenses that are causes for divorce. Walker v. Walker, 38 R.I. 362, 95 A. 925, 1915 R.I. LEXIS 78 (1915). See also Battey v. Battey, 1 R.I. 212, 1845 R.I. LEXIS 1 (1845).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the husband commenced a divorce amount as it may think necessary or proper. action alleging that the parties had been living separate and apart for the period mandated by § 15-5-3, and where the wife responded with a cross-petition in which she requested a bed and board divorce on the grounds of desertion pursuant to this section, the mandatory nature of § 15-5-3 required the Family Court justice to deny the wife’s petition for a bed and board divorce and to enter a decree dissolving the marriage. Harwood v. Harwood, 120 R.I. 145, 385 A.2d 1055, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 645 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The only reasonable way to harmonize this section and § 15-5-3.1 is to hold that “irreconcilable differences” is a ground for both an absolute divorce and a bed-and-board divorce.

<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was no merit to the wife’s contention that since the husband owned property in the state and since he had been notified by citation that she was praying for an allowance out of it pursuant to this section, that the court acquired jurisdiction to decree an allowance to be satisfied solely by such property, without personal service on the husband, since the language of this section does not create a charge upon the estate or property of the husband. Accardi v. Accardi, 97 R.I. 336, 197 A.2d 755, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 88 (1964).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because an action seeking a divorce from bed and board was quasi in rem, a Rhode Island family court had jurisdiction to hear a petition where the petitioning spouse was a Rhode Island resident and to enter child custody orders where Rhode Island had become the children’s home state; due process concerns relating to the non-petitioning spouse’s minimum contacts with the state were not a concern in an action concerning the status of Rhode Island residents.

<p class="p7"><b>Prerequisites to Separate Maintenance.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Possibility of reconciliation was not a required element of a petition for divorce from bed and board as distinct from a petition for absolute divorce. Henderson v. Henderson, 818 A.2d 669, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 52 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The language “until the parties be reconciled” is precatory rather than mandatory. Hamel v. Hamel, 426 A.2d 259, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1048 (R.I. 1981).</p>

Laws § 15-5-12(a) as requiring that a plaintiff who files a divorce complaint remain a “domiciled inhabitant” until the decree is entered would produce an unjust result, so, once a complaint for divorce is properly filed in Family Court, the Family Court is not divested of subject-matter jurisdiction merely because the plaintiff has moved out of the state and changed his or her domicile, since to hold otherwise would allow a plaintiff who is dissatisfied with the course of the divorce proceeding in Rhode Island to forum shop his or her complaint in another jurisdiction, and whether the party relocates in good faith or otherwise matters naught; a change in domicile does not terminate the jurisdiction of the Family Court to hear and decide the case before the Court.

<p class="p7"><b>Sexual Relation With Attorney.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An attorney who engages in sexual relations with his or her divorce client jeopardizes the client’s rights. Any competent attorney practicing in the area of domestic-relations law must be aware that the sexual conduct of a divorce client may have significant bearing on that client’s ability to secure child custody and in the determination of the distribution of marital assets. The lawyer’s own interest in maintaining the sexual relationship creates an inherent conflict with the proper representation of the client. In re DiPippo, 678 A.2d 454, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 199 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Visitation Rights.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The family court’s power to grant visitation rights is statutory and since the visitation portion of the petition of an aunt and uncle seeking custody and the right to visit a niece was not an ancillary facet of either a divorce proceeding or a neglect and dependency proceeding, the court was without jurisdiction to grant visitation rights. Ryan v. De Mello, 116 R.I. 264, 354 A.2d 734, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1274 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A trial judge’s findings that a child had been sexually assaulted by its father, that the child was still traumatized by the event, and that the father was unfit as a parent, justified terminating the father’s visitation rights. Seravo v. Seravo, 525 A.2d 922, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 494 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Visitation rights are to be strongly favored and should not be denied absent extreme circumstances. Hervieux v. Hervieux, 603 A.2d 337, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 44 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court’s award of visitation to a father, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-5-16(d)(1), where the father was required to either have the children for overnight visits or to pay the mother for babysitter costs, was an abuse of discretion where the court, through a magistrate, had failed to consider the best interests of the children which was the paramount consideration in making such an award; the magistrate had made the order based on what was the best interests of the wife rather than the impact of the visitation on the children. Hogan v. Hogan, 822 A.2d 925, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 132 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly determined the amount of visitation to grant a father pursuant to a motion to modify pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-5-16, and properly granted the father’s request for joint custody; the trial court found that a grant of more visitation would be too exhausting for the child and would interfere with school work, and properly found that the father would not be able to adequately cooperate with the mother on issues concerning the child. Croce v. Cawley, 828 A.2d 519, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 188 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Visitation rights are to be strongly favored and will be denied only in an extreme situation in which the children’s physical, mental, or moral health would be endangered by contact with the parent in question. Africano v. Castelli, 837 A.2d 721, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 234 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In assessing the best interests of the child for visitation purposes, the court considers: (1) the parent’s wishes; (2) child’s preference; (3) the interaction and relationship of the child to the parents; (4) the child’s adjustment to the home, school and community; (5) the mental and physical health of the individuals involved; (6) the stability of the child’s home life; (7) the moral fitness of the parents; and (8) the willingness of each parent to facilitate a close relationship between the child and the other parent. Africano v. Castelli, 837 A.2d 721, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 234 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any weight given to a child’s preference in a custody matter is committed to the sound discretion of the court after attempting to carry out a regimen of supervised visitation.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Furtherance of the best interests of the child can constitute a compelling state interest sufficient to override an unfettered constitutional right to travel. Africano v. Castelli, 837 A.2d 721, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 234 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was no abuse of discretion in suspending a father’s visitation rights with his daughter where: (1) the suspension was ordered after an attempt to comply with ordered supervised visitation; (2) continued visitation would jeopardize the child’s mental and physical health; (3) the father had sexually abused the child; and (4) the child experienced severe trauma every time she had contact with the father. Africano v. Castelli, 837 A.2d 721, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 234 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court’s refusal to release the passports of the mother and the child and the requirement that they live within 50 miles of Rhode Island were proper as the mother had a propensity to remove the child to distant locales, which provided a strong rationale for the court-imposed travel and residency restrictions as the removals often thwarted court-ordered visitations. Africano v. Castelli, 837 A.2d 721, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 234 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court did not abuse its discretion in denying unsupervised visitation because the mother failed to prove a sufficient change of circumstances from those that existed when visitation was first suspended. The mother’s own hearing testimony confirmed a complete lack of change of circumstances because she continued to deny that she had abused her daughters and admitted that she did not seek counseling for her violent behavior. Recard v. Polite, 935 A.2d 101, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 113 (R.I. 2007).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The length of the marriage;</p>

The court also shall not assign property or an interest in property which has been transferred to one of the parties by inheritance before, during, or after the term of the marriage.

<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The assignment of property, if any, to be made shall precede the award of alimony, since the needs of each party will be affected by the assignment of property, and once made in a final decree shall be final, subject only to any right of appeal which the parties may have. Any assignment made by the family court shall be regarded as a judgment for debt so that suit may be brought or execution may issue on the debt for the property due and undelivered, or the amount due and unpaid to be shown by affidavits of the person entitled to the property and the attorney of record of the person, the executions to run against the goods and chattels of the husband and wife, as the case may be; and the court may make all necessary orders and decrees concerning the suits or executions.</p>

Further, the trial justice was not clearly wrong when he found that the former husband’s interpretation of the ambiguous provision would have given him an unconscionable advantage over the former wife by affording the former husband an inordinate amount of control with respect to disposition of the property and, consequently, over his obligation to pay her $500,000.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice did not improperly take the support needs of the parties into consideration in making his equitable distribution of property (i.e., awarding the wife the use and possession of the marital domicile), even though he suggested that the husband’s interests (equity) might be subject to a lien in satisfaction of his indebtedness to his wife for support and that this lien might be implemented and executed in a later partition proceeding.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The assignment of marital assets is not based on need but rather on the partnership theory of marriage. Division of marital assets rests within the sound discretion of the trial court based upon consideration of all factors enumerated under this section, and an equitable assignment of the property should be made before reaching the issue of alimony. Therefore, because the trial court’s decision complied with these mandates, the award to the wife, who had worked several jobs in the early years of the marriage and then was a full-time homemaker, was justified.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> “Deferred sale of home order” means an order that temporarily delays the sale and awards the temporary exclusive use and possession of the family home to a custodial parent of minor children, or children for whom support is authorized under this chapter, whether or not the custodial parent has sole or joint custody, in order to minimize the adverse impact of divorce on the welfare of the children.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> “Resident parent” means a party who has requested or who has already been awarded a deferred sale of home order.</p>

In making this determination, the court shall consider the resident parent’s income, the availability of spousal support, child support, or both spousal and child support, and any other sources of funds available to make those payments. The intent in requiring this determination is to avoid defaults on the payments of notes and resulting foreclosures, to avoid inadequate insurance coverage, to prevent deterioration of the condition of the family home, and to prevent any other circumstances which would jeopardize both parents’ equity in the home. After making the determination that it is economically feasible to consider ordering a deferred sale of the family home, the court in exercising its discretion to grant or deny a deferred sale of home order, shall consider whether it is in the best interest of the child or children.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Upon a determination pursuant to subsection (b) of this section that a deferred sale of home order is indicated in order to minimize the adverse impact of divorce on the child, the court may make such an order. The order shall include the duration of the order, may include the legal description and assessor’s plat and lot number of the real property which is subject to the order, and may be recorded in the office of the registry of deeds of the city or town in which the real property is located.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The court may make an order specifying the parties’ respective responsibilities for the payment of the costs of routine maintenance and capital improvements.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> A deferred sale of home order may be modified or terminated at any time at the discretion of the court.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> In making an order pursuant to this section, the court shall reserve jurisdiction to determine any and all issues that arise with respect to the deferred sale of home order including, but not limited to, the maintenance of the home and the tax consequences to each party.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> In a proceeding for divorce, divorce from bed and board, a miscellaneous petition without the filing of divorce proceedings, or child support, the court shall order either or both parents owing a duty of support to a child to pay an amount based upon a formula and guidelines adopted by an administrative order of the family court. If, after calculating support based upon court established formula and guidelines, the court, in its discretion, finds the order would be inequitable to the child or either parent, the court shall make findings of fact and shall order either or both parents owing a duty of support to pay an amount reasonable or necessary for the child’s support after considering all relevant factors including, but not limited to:</p>

<p class="p6">Notwithstanding the foregoing, the court, in its discretion, may order child support, in the case of a child with a severe physical or mental impairment still living with or under the care of a parent, beyond the child’s emancipation as defined above. The court shall consider the following factors when making its determination: (1) The nature and extent of the disability; (2) The cost of the extraordinary medical expenses; (3) The ability of the child to earn income; (4) The financial resources of the child; (5) The financial resources of the parents; (6) The inability of the primary caregiver of the child to sustain gainful employment on a full-time basis due to the care necessitated by the child. The onset of the disability must have occurred prior to the emancipation event. If a child support order for a child with a severe physical or mental impairment has been terminated, suspended, or expired, the court shall consider the factors in this paragraph and has the discretion to order child support for this child prospectively based upon established child support guidelines.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a wife could have sought child support under the terms of a “decree nisi” granting her divorce, but she did not, she was not allowed, ten years later, under the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel, to claim alleged back-due child support payments under the terms of a former superceded interlocutory decree granted pending the final divorce.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Laches was allowed as a defense to a claim for child support payments as allowed by this section where an attempt was made after over four years to correct a final divorce decree retroactively by amendment to provide for such payments where it appeared that the petitioner failed to explain her inaction for what was a substantial period of time and where the respondent was prejudiced by such long inaction. Pukas v. Pukas, 104 R.I. 542, 247 A.2d 427, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 682 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff ’s action against defendant husband to pay money owed for the cost of education of the minor children was not barred by the doctrine of laches even though eleven years had elapsed between the time plaintiff first enrolled her child in private school and the time she brought the action.

<p class="p7"><b>Determination of Amount.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the child-support guidelines adopted by the Family Court determine the amount of child support to be ordered based on gross income and the number of dependent children, it is necessary for the trial justice to make an approximate calculation of defendant’s gross income, taking into account deductions that would ordinarily be applied to his gross income, in order to reach the net-income figure represented by his workers’ compensation benefits. Chace v. Finlay, 576 A.2d 1233, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 129 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, read in conjunction with Rhode Island Family Court Administrative Order No. 87-2, requires that the Family Court justice first review the prescribed child-support worksheet to determine the base level of a child-support order that the noncustodial parent would be ordered to pay. Only if the Family Court justice finds that the recommended child-support order would be inequitable to the child or to either parent, and makes findings of facts to the same, may he or she deviate from the calculated amount. Lembo v. Lembo, 624 A.2d 1089, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 138 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although both Administrative Order 87-02 of the Family Court and this section allow the Family Court to deviate from the worksheet guidelines after considering certain factors, provided the amount of support calculated in the prescribed worksheet is supported by a finding based on the facts that the recommended child support order would not be inequitable to the child or either parent, such discretion was abused since the award of child support was significantly disproportionate to that prescribed by the formula without any justification for the divergence from the guidelines. Mattera v. Mattera, 669 A.2d 538, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 6 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The family court erred in determining child support without a child-support worksheet as required by an administrative order of the court and this section, necessitating a remand to the family court to consider this information.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a father, although disabled, spent hours participating in local government or collecting artifacts, a family court magistrate did not err in concluding that the father was capable of additional income when the magistrate determined the father’s child support obligations.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court, through a magistrate, abused its discretion in ordering that a husband pay an amount for child support that exceeded the child support guidelines by 20 percent, without having made specific findings of fact that justified such an excess award.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice abused discretion in determining a husband’s child support and spousal support obligations because the justice first terminated the husband’s obligation without a hearing or findings of fact about the husband’s ability to pay and then reinstated half the obligation, also without a hearing, any reference to the child support guidelines, or a showing of a change in circumstances. Cardinale v. Cardinale, 889 A.2d 210, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 1 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In calculating a father’s child support obligation, the magistrate erred by not including his locality adjustment pay in his income on grounds it was not taxable, as there was no exception for nontaxable income in the Rhode Island child-support guidelines, and such pay constituted “expense reimbursements or in-kind payments” that reduced the father’s living expenses. Tamayo v. Arroyo, 15 A.3d 1031, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 41 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In calculating a father’s child support obligation, in accepting his claim that he had a loss from his rental property, the magistrate erred in ignoring abundant testimony about his net rental income and in relying on an old tax return showing a loss, although a newer one was available. Tamayo v. Arroyo, 15 A.3d 1031, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 41 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In calculating a father’s child support obligation, instead of determining whether the mother’s day care costs were reasonable, the magistrate erred in holding that she was not entitled to reimbursement for past or future expenses based on the father’s claims that the mother’s provider was not reporting her income to the Internal Revenue Service and that the father’s wife and mother were willing to provide day care for free. Tamayo v. Arroyo, 15 A.3d 1031, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 41 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In calculating a father’s child support obligation, the magistrate abused his discretion by confining his review to the father’s 2006 reported earnings, where evidence of his 2007 income was available for review. Tamayo v. Arroyo, 15 A.3d 1031, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 41 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In calculating a father’s child support obligation, the magistrate abused his discretion in failing to include the father’s one-time bonus in his income, as required by R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the trial justice predicated the child support order on the ex-husband’s earning capacity of $30,000 per year and the ex-wife’s current earnings of approximately $520 per week, the trial justice did not appear to have considered the child support guidelines in accordance with the dictates of this section and the family court administrative order; the record was devoid of any child support guidelines worksheet, as was required. Thus, it was necessary to remand the case to the family court for a determination of an appropriate order of child support. Vieira v. Hussein-Vieira, 150 A.3d 611, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 126 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice conducted a “careful review” as required by the child support guidelines; although an S corporation’s net income and distributions were included on a father’s income tax return, the trial justice looked beyond that document and considered the abundance of testimony from the accountant for the S corporation. Trojan v. Trojan, 208 A.3d 221, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 77 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice acted within his discretion in applying a “legitimate business purpose” analysis to find that an S corporation’s retained earnings could not be included in a father’s gross income for the purposes of determining his child support obligation because the S corporation’s retained earnings had been used for legitimate business reasons in the past and were in no way used to shield or manipulate the father’s income to reduce or avoid his child support obligation. Trojan v. Trojan, 208 A.3d 221, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 77 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not err in excluding an S corporation’s undistributed pass-through income from a father’s gross income for calculating his child support obligation because the accountant for the S corporation was clear in his testimony that a bond requirement was not static and that the figure was completely dependent on the company’s total sales revenue, which was subject to considerable fluctuation in the construction industry.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice correctly excluded an S corporation’s distribution to a father, its sole shareholder, that was used to pay its tax liabilities because the distribution was used to pay taxes on the pass-through income that the father received from the S corporation; the pass-through income the father received and on which he paid taxes was actually retained by the S corporation for a legitimate business purpose and was not distributed to him.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice erred when he excluded moneys from a father’s gross income because the distributions that the father received from an S corporation to satisfy note payments should have been considered as part of his gross income under the child support guidelines; the father’s obligation to pay buyers for the purchase of their stock in the S corporation was personal in nature, and the father used distributions from the S corporation to meet that personal obligation.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice acted well within the bounds of his discretion when he ruled that ample funds were available to a mother to support herself and her child during the remainder of the divorce proceeding because the mother’s counsel conceded to the trial justice that the child did not require $16,000 per month in child support; counsel acknowledged that the mother had been using funds derived from the joint marital account to support herself and the child while the divorce proceedings were pending.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The family court did not have jurisdiction to enforce a property settlement agreement which required the defendant to contribute to the support and education of the children beyond the age of 19 where the agreement was incorporated by reference and merged into the final divorce decree. When the final decree of divorce was entered, the settlement agreement between the parties ceased to exist and the court’s ability to compel defendant to pay support was limited by this section, which confers jurisdiction on the court to order payment of child support and education costs for children until they reach age 18, or until age 19 in some limited circumstances.

Gen. Laws § 18-7-2(5); further, the fact that the daughter had reached the age of majority was another reason that the family court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter, pursuant to R.I. Gen.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> For purposes of this section, a “child support order” means a child support order enforceable pursuant to the Rhode Island state plan for support enforcement as further defined in § 15-16-5(a).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Every three (3) years from the date the child support order was established or modified, and upon the request of either party, or upon the request of the state pursuant to § 15-5-16.2(c)(3), the court shall review and, if appropriate, adjust the order in accordance with the child support guidelines if the amount of the child support award under the order differs from the amount that would be awarded in accordance with the guidelines. The adjustment of the order shall be made under this subsection without a requirement for proof or showing of a change in circumstances. In adjusting the order, incarceration may not be treated as voluntary unemployment that would prevent the motion from being heard or result in a denial of the motion.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the Family Court awarded the wife temporary support and other temporary relief and the husband was adjudged in contempt for failing to comply with the court’s decrees, and where there was also a basic jurisdictional conflict, the court exercised its discretion to issue the writ of certiorari despite its persistent reluctance to review interlocutory decrees or to permit matters to be brought before it in piecemeal fashion.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the final decree for divorce had not been actually signed or entered prior to the date of the respondent’s objection to the entry on grounds of misconduct, since the divorce proceedings follow the course of equity and it is considered that what should have been done had in fact been done, the prior oral decision constituted the final decree and the entry thereof, and, consequently, respondent was without standing in court at the time of the presentation of his objection, since the parties were no longer husband and wife.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an interlocutory decree provided for the partition sale of the husband’s real estate pursuant to a divorce action, and where the husband died during the interlocutory period, the joint tenancy of the parties was not severed by the decree but remained in full force and effect throughout the interlocutory period up until the death of the husband at which time the property passed by right of survivorship.

<p class="p7"><b>Purpose of Waiting Period.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One of the reasons required for the delay required by the statute in the entry of a final decree is to give the parties an opportunity for reconciliation.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This statute clearly indicates a legislative intent requiring, as a matter of public policy, the parties to be given an opportunity for reconciliation, the prevailing party to demean himself or herself as the case may be, as a faithful spouse until the entry of the final decree.

<p class="p7"><b>Timeliness of Appeal.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the rule requiring the filing of a notice of appeal is mandatory, plaintiff’s notice of appeal from a divorce decree was untimely since it was not filed until more than three months after the entry of the decision and since no mention was made of excusable neglect.

<p class="p6"><b>(b) (1)</b> In the event that the petition is filed pursuant to subsection (a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(iii), or (a)(2)(vii) of this section, the court shall find as a fact that, prior to the granting of the petition, such parental conduct or conditions must have occurred or existed notwithstanding the reasonable efforts that shall be made by the agency prior to the filing of the petition to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship so that the child can safely return to the family. In the event that a petition is filed pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(ii), (a)(2)(iv), (a)(2)(v), (a)(2)(vi), or (a)(4) of this section, the department has no obligation to engage in reasonable efforts to preserve and reunify a family.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The consideration shall include the following: If a child has been placed in foster family care, voluntarily or involuntarily, the court shall determine whether the child has been integrated into the foster family to the extent that the child’s familial identity is with the foster family and whether the foster family is able and willing to permanently integrate the child into the foster family; provided, that in considering integrating into a foster family, the court should consider:</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> In the event any child, the parental rights to whom have been finally terminated, has not been placed by the agency in the home of a person or persons with the intention of adopting the child within thirty (30) days from the date of the final termination decree, the family court shall review the status of the child and the agency shall file a report that documents the steps the agency is taking to find an adoptive family or other permanent living arrangement for the child, to place the child with an adoptive family, a fit and willing relative, a legal guardian, or in another planned permanent living arrangement, and to finalize the adoption or legal guardianship. At a minimum, this documentation shall include child specific recruitment efforts, such as the use of state, regional, and national adoption exchanges, including electronic exchange system.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Abandonment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was ample evidence in the record to support a finding of abandonment where substantial periods elapsed during which a father had no contact with his children, since the abandonment provision does not include the element of willfullness to show such abandonment. In re Craig G., 765 A.2d 1200, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 34 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since it is the parent, not the children’s agency, who is responsible to substantially and repeatedly maintain contact with the children, there is no obligation on the part of the agency to engage in reasonable efforts to preserve and reunify a family where an abandonment is involved. In re Devone S., 777 A.2d 1268, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 134 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A prima facie case of abandonment was established where the father of an eight-year-old boy had made only one request for visitation and had never contacted the children’s agency. In re Devone S., 777 A.2d 1268, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 134 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the father, who was in prison, refused any contact with the child for over a year, the child was abandoned under R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-7-7(a)(4). In re Dekarri P., 787 A.2d 1170, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 274 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The father’s failure to visit or to have any contact with his son for a 13-month time span constituted prima facie evidence of abandonment under R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-7-7(a)(4). In re Diamond I., 797 A.2d 1076, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 108 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the trial court found that the father had not communicated with or seen his son for at least six months, such finding constituted prima facie evidence of abandonment or desertion pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-7-7(a)(4), even if the father stated that he had not formed the requisite intent to abandon his son; the court could find that the fact that the father was imprisoned did not excuse his failure because he could have moved to change the visitation or to have some form of contact. In re Damien M., 819 A.2d 213, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 56 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Father’s parental rights to his minor child were properly terminated on grounds of abandonment pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-7-7(a)(4), as the evidence in the record clearly supported the trial justice’s conclusion that the father had little or no contact with the child and had not really tried to have any contact with the child since his incarceration, and the father could not rely on his incarceration to rebut a finding of abandonment. In re Unique T., 822 A.2d 182, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 118 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Termination of the parental rights of a father who was incarcerated for life was proper under R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-7-7(a)(4), abandonment, since the father had not attempted to contact the two sons since the night he murdered their mother 12 years before. In re Shawn B., 864 A.2d 621, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 11 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Legally competent evidence supported a hearing justice’s decision to terminate a father’s parental rights to his child, where the hearing justice found by clear and convincing evidence that the father had abandoned and deserted the child. In re Danesha J., 889 A.2d 230, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 220 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Father’s meager attempts to maintain contact with his child were insufficient to overcome more than 19 months of his indifference to her, during which he made four or five attempts to contact his child, and much less did they evince an intent to establish a parent-child relationship with the child; the evidence sufficiently supported a trial court’s order terminating the father’s parental rights. In re Serenity K., 891 A.2d 881, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 23 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a mother had not seen her children for 15 months, the petition filed by the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families to terminate her parental rights was properly granted because, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-7-7(a)(4), it proved abandonment by clear and convincing evidence. Her lack of cooperation with offered services in no way excused her abandonment of her children for more than the statutory six-month period. In re Ariel N., 892 A.2d 80, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 13 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly terminated a father’s parental rights pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-7-7(a)(2)(i) when the father was incarcerated under a six-year sentence, and thus was unable to care for his child for an extended period of time; the father made no attempts to contact his daughter or to provide her with any kind of support; and he did not contact his social worker about reunification after the social worker attempted to implement a parent case plan prior to sending the father a letter regarding his daughter’s proposed adoption. In re Alvia K., 909 A.2d 498, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 165 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the termination of a father’s parental rights, the trial court’s definition of abandonment that required a showing of willfulness was clearly erroneous because in accordance with R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-7-7(a)(4), the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) needed only to present evidence of a lack of any meaningful contact between the father and his daughter for a period of at least six months to constitute prima facie evidence of abandonment. Nevertheless, the error was harmless in light that DCYF sustained its burden under § 15-7-7(a)(2). In re Alvia K., 909 A.2d 498, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 165 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Clear and convincing evidence supported the termination of a father’s parental rights on grounds of abandonment, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-7-7(a)(4), because the father had not seen his child in four years, which was longer than the six-month statutory period required to establish abandonment under § 15-7-7(a)(4); the father’s incarceration was not an excuse for failing to maintain contact with the child for the statutory period. In re Brook Ann R., 994 A.2d 1241, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 62 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) failed to offer sufficient evidence for a termination of a father’s parental rights based on abandonment under R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-7-7(a)(4) as: (1) DCYF did not show that the father had not communicated with the child for more than six months; (2) the father was denied joint custody and visitation, but was allowed to refile a motion for visitation after the father had successfully completed a drug-treatment program; (3) the father had completed the drug-treatment program, but was again denied visitation subject to the completion of a parent-child evaluation upon the father’s release; and (4) the trial justice failed to make any findings as to whether the father’s efforts to seek visitation were in fact a good faith attempt to establish a relationship with the child sufficient to overcome the evidence of abandonment or desertion. In re Angelina T., 996 A.2d 623, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 76 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Termination of father’s parental rights based on abandonment was supported by evidence that the father left Rhode Island for well over a year after the children were removed from the father’s care, the father did not contact the children during that time, and it was in the best interest of the children to obtain permanency and adoption was only viable means to that end. In re Daniel D., 9 A.3d 651, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 112 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Father’s parental rights to two children were properly terminated on grounds of abandonment because the father had not visited with the children for nearly one year prior to trial and was not legally prevented from contacting the children. In re Isabella M., 66 A.3d 825, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 91 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in terminating father’s parental rights, based on abandonment, where sufficient factual findings and credibility determinations supported the decision; the trial court found that the father, who was incarcerated for periods of time, did not make any reasonable effort to see the child or to contact the child for years and any attempted contact by the father was halfhearted at best. A parent’s sporadic attempts to contact his or her child are inadequate to rebut a prima facie case of abandonment. In re Livia B.L., 151 A.3d 756, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 7 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court correctly concluded that a father abandoned his son because the father had no contact with the son for more than two years and minimal contact with the Department of Children, Youth and Families concerning his son; neither the father’s incarceration nor the no-contact orders relieved the father of his obligation to remain in contact with his son, and the father’s incarceration was a direct result of inflicting physical abuse on the child. In re Malachii O., 152 A.3d 1153, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 16 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In terminating a father’s parental rights with respect to his two sons, the trial justice did not err in finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the father had abandoned his children for the six-month period referenced in R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-7-7(a)(4). Despite the father having once inquired about his children through his fiancé in December 2013, the father failed to make further attempts to contact his children while he was incarcerated. In re Kyeshon J., 153 A.3d 499, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 19 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Abuse.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was clear and convincing evidence to support the petition for termination of the mother’s parental rights for abuse. See In re Frances, 505 A.2d 1380, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 429 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The scope of a trial court’s inquiry in parental termination proceedings under subsection (c) of this section is not limited to events occurring prior to the filing of the petition. In re Lori D., 510 A.2d 421, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 480 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not require reasonable efforts at reunification when the parents merely permit, rather than inflict themselves, horrific abuse upon children. In re Chester J., 754 A.2d 772, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 161 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state was not required to prove which parent actually inflicted extreme abuse upon a child, since allowing either parent to ignore or to stand by while such abuse and neglect occurred would be tantamount to the parents inflicting the abuse themselves for the purposes of a termination pursuant to this provision. In re Chester J., 754 A.2d 772, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 161 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Adoption After Determination of Petition.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statutory language of the third paragraph of subdivision (d) (now subsection (d)) clearly indicates that the legislature contemplated that the agency might place the child for adoption after the determination of a petition to terminate parental rights. In re David, 427 A.2d 795, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1055 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Child’s mother could file a petition of adoption in combination with a spouse or a grandparent of the child to be adopted; the Family Court may grant the petition of a mother and a grandfather to adopt a child over the father’s objection if there are grounds to terminate the father’s parental rights under R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-7-7. In re Abby D., 839 A.2d 1222, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 11 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Adoption by Foster Parents.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since foster parents do not have standing to adopt unless there has been a finding by the department of children and their families that such an adoption is in the best interest of the child, where the department does not make such a finding and, in fact, determines that it is in the child’s best interest to be reunited with his natural mother, the foster parents have no chance of success on the merits, and a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to prevent such a reunification until there can be a hearing on a petition for adoption is not warranted. In re Joseph J., 465 A.2d 150, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1072 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Appeals.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notices of appeal filed by a child’s mother and father from a family court judgment terminating their parental rights and by the child’s aunt from the denial of her petition for open adoption were treated as though they were timely even though they were all filed prior to the actual entry of judgment; such treatment was routinely accorded to prematurely-filed notices of appeal by the Supreme Court of Rhode Island. In re Kayla N., 900 A.2d 1202, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 130 (R.I. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1252, 127 S. Ct. 1372, 167 L. Ed. 2d 159, 2007 U.S. LEXIS 2680 (2007).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>— Mental Deficiency.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because of the small likelihood of change in a mother’s mental condition from the time of an expert’s examination until trial, such expert’s testimony lost little of its probative force by virtue of its age; consequently, reliance on such evidence in terminating parental rights was not error.

<p class="p7"><b>Provision of Proper Services.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court did not err in finding that the children’s agency provided a mother with proper services since five case plans were prepared to help the parents obtain the needed skills to effectively parent their disabled child, the mother failed to complete or follow through on various programs and services, and the agency repeatedly emphasized to the mother that her resistance to mental health treatment would have an adverse impact on her ability to reunite with her son.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As the Department of Children, Youth and Families believed a mother’s alcohol abuse was a major barrier to reunification, but did not refer her to individual alcohol treatment or counseling before petitioning to terminate her parental rights, it did not make reasonable efforts to reunify her with her children, and the family court thus erred in terminating her parental rights.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Family court did not err in finding that the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) made reasonable efforts to correct the situation that led to the daughters’ removal from their father’s care because DCYF complied with its statutory obligation, but the father failed to comply with its recommendations, declined to follow through with any mental-health counseling, and refused to cooperate with DCYF’s case plans.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mother’s inability to complete numerous case plans demonstrated her lack of judgment and maturity, and her persistent tendency to place her own interests above those of the child demonstrated that she had not made good-faith efforts to adjust her circumstances, conduct, or conditions.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The 12 month period in the termination of parental rights statute is separate and distinct from that in the abused children statute in that a parent’s refusal to cooperate with mandatory, court-ordered services after an adjudication of neglect or abuse and a parent’s lack of cooperation with the department of children, youth and families before such an adjudication represent significantly different behaviors under the law, with the latter only being a factor that a court takes into consideration in resolving a petition for termination of parental rights, not the principal ground for such termination.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Upon the filing of a petition so presented and consented to for the adoption of a minor child, the court shall notify the department of children, youth and families. It shall then be the duty of the department to verify the allegations of the petition, and to make appropriate investigation to determine whether the proposed adoptive home is a suitable home for the child. The department shall, within sixty (60) days, submit to the court a full report in writing, with recommendation as to the granting of the petition and any other information regarding the child or the proposed home that the court shall require. In circumstances where the petition for adoption concerns a child who has been placed for adoption by a duly licensed, child-placement agency, the court may accept the home study report of the child-placement agency in lieu of the investigation and recommendation of the department of children, youth and families; provided, the child-placement agency includes in its home-study report any criminal record of the prospective adoptive parent. All costs relating to criminal background checks shall be the responsibility of the public or private entity conducting the home study;</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> As part of the investigation or investigative home-study report, a request shall be made to the attorney general through the division of criminal identification to make available any criminal record of the prospective adoptive parent maintained by the division. The prospective adoptive parent, and any household member age 18 and older, shall apply to the bureau of criminal identification of the state police or the local police department, or the department of children, youth and families, for a nationwide criminal records check unless they have previously submitted to a nationwide criminal records check in accordance with § 14-1-34 and/or §§ 40-13.2-2, 40-13.2-4 and/or 40-13.2-5 and/or §§ 16-48.1-4 and 16-48.1-5. The attorney general shall immediately comply with the request of the department or child-placement agency, and the report of the attorney general shall be made part of the investigative home study submitted to court.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Pursuant to § 40-13.2-4, the director of DCYF will determine by rules and regulations those items of information appearing on a criminal records check that constitute disqualifying information because that information would indicate the prospective adoptive parent could endanger the health or welfare of a child or children. Upon the discovery of any disqualifying information with respect to a proposed prospective adoptive parent, the director shall inform the agency that disqualifying information has been discovered, without disclosing the nature of the disqualifying information.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> At the conclusion of any criminal records check required by this section, the fingerprint card of the person subject to the nationwide criminal records check shall be promptly destroyed.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Provisions of this section may, in the discretion of the court, be waived in the case of a petition for the adoption of a child where the child is the natural child of one of the parties petitioning for the adoption and resides with the petitioning parties.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Specific definitions and procedures for adoptive home studies are to be provided in regulations promulgated by the department of children, youth and families in accordance with the administrative procedures act. All investigative home studies submitted to the court shall be based on a minimum of two (2) home visits by the agency conducting the home study. All prospective siblings and any other household members shall be interviewed during a home visit. Agencies conducting the home study shall have a minimum of one home visit following completion of the home study process. A summary of the agency’s past and present contact with the prospective adoptive family shall be included in the home study. The agency shall include in the home study its recommendations for approval or disapproval of the adoption and the reasons for its conclusion.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>INTERSTATE COMPACT ON ADOPTION<br>
AND MEDICAL ASSISTANCE</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article I. Finding.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The states which are parties to this Compact find that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> In order to obtain adoptive families for children with special needs, states must assure prospective adoptive parents of substantial assistance (usually on a continuing basis) in meeting the high costs of supporting and providing for the special needs and the services required by these children.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> The states have a fundamental interest in promoting adoption for children with special needs because the care, emotional stability, and general support and encouragement required by these children can be best, and often only, obtained in family homes with a normal parent-child relationship.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> The states obtain fiscal advantages from providing adoption assistance because the alternative is for the states to bear the higher cost of meeting all the needs of all children while in foster care.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(d)</b> The necessary assurances of adoption assistance for children with special needs, in those instances where children and adoptive parents live in states other than the one undertaking to provide the assistance, include the establishment and maintenance of suitable substantive guarantees and workable procedures for interstate cooperation and payments to assist with the necessary costs of child maintenance, the procurement of services, and the provision of medical assistance.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>II. Purposes.</b></p>
<p class="p6">The purposes of this Compact are to:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Strengthen protections for the interests of children with special needs on behalf of whom adoption assistance is committed to be paid, when these children are in or move to states other than the one committed to provide adoption assistance.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> Provide substantive assurances and operating procedures which will promote the delivery of medical and other services to children on an interstate basis through programs of adoption assistance established by the laws of the states which are parties to this Compact.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article III. Definitions.</b></p>
<p class="p6">As used in this Compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> “Child with special needs” means a minor who has not yet attained the age at which the state normally discontinues children’s services, or a child who has not yet reached the age of 21, where the state determines that the child’s mental or physical handicaps warrant the continuation of assistance beyond the age of majority, for whom the state has determined the following:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> That the child cannot or should not be returned to the home of his or her parents;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> That there exists with respect to the child a specific factor or condition (such as his or her ethnic background, age or membership in a minority or sibling group, or the presence of factors such as a medical condition or physical, mental, or emotional handicaps) because of which it is reasonable to conclude that the child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> That, except where it would be against the best interests of the child because of such factors as the existence of significant emotional ties with prospective adoptive parents while in their care as a foster child, a reasonable but unsuccessful effort has been made to place the child with appropriate adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> “Adoption assistance” means the payment or payments for the maintenance of a child which are made or committed to be made pursuant to the adoption assistance program established by the laws of a party state.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> “State” means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or a Territory or Possession of the United States.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(d)</b> “Adoption assistance state” means the state that is signatory to adoption assistance agreement in a particular case.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(e)</b> “Residence state” means the state in which the child is a resident by virtue of the residence of the adoptive parents.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(f)</b> “Parents” means either the singular or plural of the word “parent”.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article IV. Adoption Assistance.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Each state shall determine the amounts of adoption assistance and other aid which it will give to children with special needs and their adoptive parents in accordance with its own laws and programs. The adoption assistance and other aid may be made subject to periodic reevaluation of eligibility by the adoption assistance state in accordance with its laws.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The adoption assistance, medical assistance, and other services and benefits to which this Compact applies are those provided to children with special needs and their adoptive parents from the effective date of the adoption assistance agreement.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Every case of adoption assistance shall include a written adoption assistance agreement between the adoptive parents and the appropriate agency of the state undertaking to provide the adoption assistance. Every such agreement shall contain provisions for the fixing of actual or potential interstate aspects of the assistance provided as follows:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> An express commitment that the assistance provided shall be payable without regard for the state of residence of the adoptive parents, both at the outset of the agreement period and at all times during its continuance;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> A provision setting forth with particularity the types of care and services toward which the adoption assistance state will make payments:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> A commitment to make medical assistance available to the child in accordance with Article V of this Compact;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> An express declaration that the agreement is for the benefit of the child, the adoptive parents and the state and that it is enforceable by any or all of them; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> The date or dates upon which each payment or other benefit provided under the agreement is to commence, but in no event prior to the effective date of the adoption assistance agreement.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Any services or benefits provided for a child by the residence state and the adoption assistance state may be facilitated by the party states on each other’s behalf. To this end, the personnel of the child welfare agencies of the party states will assist each other, as well as the beneficiaries of adoption assistance agreements, in assuring prompt and full access to all benefits expressly included in these agreements. It is further recognized and agreed that, in general, all children to whom adoption assistance agreements apply will be eligible for benefits under the child welfare, education, rehabilitation, mental health, and other programs of their state of residence on the same basis as other resident children.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Adoption assistance payments on behalf of a child in another state shall be made on the same basis and in the same amounts as they would be made if the child were living in the state making the payments, except that the laws of the adoption assistance may provide for the payment of higher amounts.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article V. Medical Assistance.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Children for whom a party state is committed, in accordance with the terms of an adoption assistance agreement, to provide federally aided medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., are eligible for this medical assistance during the entire period for which the agreement is in effect. Upon application, the adoptive parents of a child who is the subject of the adoption assistance agreement shall receive a medical assistance identification document made out in the child’s name. The identification shall be issued by the medical assistance program of the residence state and shall entitle the child to the same benefits pursuant to the same procedures, as any other child who is covered by the medical assistance program in the state, whether or not the adoptive parents are themselves eligible for medical assistance.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The identification document shall bear no indication that an adoption assistance agreement with another state is the basis for its issuance. However, if the identification is issued pursuant to such an adoption assistance agreement, the records of the issuing state and the adoption assistance state shall show the fact, and shall contain a copy of the adoption assistance agreement and any amendment or replacement of the agreement, as well as all other pertinent information. The adoption assistance and medical assistance programs of the adoption assistance state shall be notified of the issuance of such identification.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> A state which has issued a medical assistance identification document pursuant to this Compact, which identification is valid and currently in force, shall accept, process and pay medical assistance claims as it would with any other medical assistance claims by eligible residents.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The federally aided medical assistance provided by a party state pursuant to this Compact shall be in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this article. In addition, when a child who is covered by an adoption assistance agreement is living in another party state, payment or reimbursement for any medical services and benefits specified under the terms of the adoption assistance agreement, which are not available to the child under Title XIX medical assistance program of the residence state, shall be made by the adoption assistance state as required by its law. Any payments provided shall be of the same kind and at the same rates as provided for children who are living in the adoption assistance state. However, where the payment rate authorized for a covered service under the medical assistance program of the adoption assistance state exceeds the rate authorized by the residence state for that service, the adoption assistance state shall not be required to pay the additional amounts for the services or benefits covered by the residence state.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> A child referred to in paragraph (a) of this Article, whose residence is changed from one party state to another party state shall be eligible for federally aided medical assistance under the medical assistance program of the new state of residence.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article VI. Compact Administration.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> In accordance with its own laws and procedures, each state which is a party to this Compact shall designate a Compact Administrator and those Deputy Compact Administrators as it deems necessary. The Compact Administrator shall coordinate all activities under this Compact within his or her state. The Compact Administrator shall also be the principal contact for officials and agencies within and without the state for the facilitation of interstate relations involving this Compact and the protection of benefits and services provided pursuant to this Compact. In this capacity, the Compact Administrator will be responsible for assisting child welfare agency personnel from other party states and adoptive families receiving adoption and medical assistance on an interstate basis.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Acting jointly, the Compact Administrators shall develop uniform forms and administrative procedures for the interstate monitoring and delivery of adoption and medical assistance benefits and services pursuant to this Compact. The forms and procedures so developed may deal with such matters as:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Documentation of continuing adoption assistance eligibility;</p>

Such supplementary agreements shall not be inconsistent with this Compact, nor shall they relieve the party states of any obligation to provide adoption and medical assistance in accordance with applicable state and federal law and the terms of this Compact.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Administrative procedures or forms implementing the supplementary agreements referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this Article may be developed by joint action of the Compact Administrators of those states which are party to such supplementary agreements.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> It shall be the responsibility of the Compact Administrator to ascertain whether and to what extent additional legislation may be necessary in his or her own state to carry out the provisions of this Article or Article IV or any supplementary agreements pursuant to this Compact.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article VII. Joinder and Withdrawal.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> This Compact shall be open to joinder by any state. It shall enter into force as to a state when its duly constituted and empowered authority has executed it.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">It is the policy of this state that adoption is based upon the legal termination of parental rights and responsibilities of birth parents and the creation of the legal relationship of parents and child between an adoptee and the adoptive parents. These legal and social premises underlying adoption must be maintained. The state recognizes that some adults who are adopted as children have a strong desire to obtain identifying information about their birth parents while other adult adoptees have no such desire. The state further recognizes that some birth parents have a strong desire to obtain identifying information about their biological children who were adopted, while other birth parents have no such desire. The state fully recognizes the right to privacy and confidentiality of birth parents whose children were adopted, the adoptees, and the adoptive parents. The purpose of this chapter is to:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Establish a passive voluntary adoption reunion registry where birth parents, adult adoptees, and surviving relatives of deceased birth parents and deceased adoptees as defined in this chapter may register their willingness of the release of identifying information to each other;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Provide for the disclosure of identifying information to birth parents and their genetic offspring through the court if a birth parent or parents and the adult adoptee are registered;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Provide for the transmission of non-identifying health and social and genetic history of the adult adoptees, birth parents, and other specified persons; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> Provide a mechanism in the court to inform registrants of the functions and procedures of the registry at the time of registration.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Whenever the department of children, youth and families shall pay for the support and maintenance of any child pursuant to §§ 42-72-13 and 42-72-14, or whenever another department, agency, society, institution, or person having the charge, care, or custody of a child shall pay for the support and maintenance of the child, the court shall order either or both parents owing a duty of support to a child to pay an amount based upon a formula and guidelines adopted by an administrative order of the family court. If, after calculating support based upon court established formula and guidelines, the court, in its discretion, finds the proposed order would be inequitable to the child or either parent, the court shall make findings of fact and shall order either or both parents owing a duty of support to pay an amount reasonable or necessary for the child’s support after considering all relevant factors, including, but not limited to:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The financial resources of the child;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The financial resources of the custodial parent;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The standard of living the child would have enjoyed had the marriage not been dissolved;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> The physical and emotional condition of the child and his or her educational needs; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> The financial resources and needs of the non-custodial parent.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> If it deems necessary or advisable, the court may order child support and education costs for children attending high school at the time of their eighteenth (18th) birthday and for ninety (90) days after graduation, but in no case beyond their nineteenth (19th) birthday. In addition, the court may order the support of a child with a severe physical or mental impairment to continue until the twenty-first (21st) birthday of the child.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> After a decree for support has been entered and upon the petition of either party, the court may review and alter its decree relative to the amount and payment of support. If the court finds that a substantial change in circumstances has occurred, the decree may be made retroactive to the date that notice of a petition to modify was given to the adverse party. In such a case the court shall set forth in its decision the specific findings of fact which show a substantial change in circumstances and why the decree should be made retroactive.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Any order for child support issued by the family court shall contain a provision requiring either or both parents owing a duty of support to a child to obtain health insurance coverage for the child when such coverage is available to the parent or parents through their employment without cost or at a reasonable cost. “Reasonable cost” shall be defined in accordance with guidelines adopted by administrative order of the family court in conjunction with the child support guidelines.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Any existing child support orders may be modified in accordance with this section unless the court makes specific written findings of fact that take into consideration the best interests of the child and conclude that a child support order or medical order would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> In addition, the national medical support notice shall be issued with respect to all orders issued, enforced, or modified on or after October 1, 2002, in accordance with chapter 29 of this title. The notice shall inform the employer of provisions in the child support order for health care coverage for the child and of the method to implement this coverage. In lieu of the court ordering the non-custodial parent to obtain or maintain health care coverage for the child, the court may order the non-custodial parent to contribute a weekly cash amount towards the medical premium for health care coverage paid by the state of Rhode Island and/or the custodial parent. The method to determine a reasonable weekly amount shall be addressed in a family court administrative order pertaining to the child support guidelines.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> All support orders established or modified in the state on or after October 1, 1998, shall be recorded with the Rhode Island family court/department of administration, division of taxation child support computer enforcement system. The system maintains the official registry of support orders entered in accordance with applicable administrative orders issued by the Rhode Island family court.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> In any subsequent child support enforcement action between the parties, upon sufficient showing that a diligent effort has been made to ascertain the location of such a party, the court may allow for notice and service of process to be made by first class mail or by service of written notice to the most recent residential or employer address of record, as specified in the Rhode Island rules of procedure for domestic relations for the Family Court of Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> The department of children, youth, and families shall not seek child support for services to the child which are special education services as defined under state and federal law and pursuant to the regulations of the board of regents for elementary and secondary education governing the special education of students with disabilities, section two, I., 1.0-4.11 and 34 C.F.R.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the statute of limitations for personal injuries was extended from two to three years and shortly thereafter the age of majority was reduced from 21 to 18 years, the plaintiff argued that the two statutes should be read together so that she would have three years from the time the disability of minority was removed in which to commence her action, but the court held that the action accrued at the time of the injury, and, since that event occurred before either the effective date of the new statute of limitations or its retrospective application provision, the original two-year statute of limitations applied and plaintiff’s suit was untimely.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> In any proceeding brought for failure to make support payments as ordered by the court, upon a showing that the payments are more than forty-five (45) days overdue, the family court may grant an order directing that an execution issue against the wages, debts, earnings, salary, income from trust funds, or profits of the parent responsible for support for the full amount of both the arrears payments and for the satisfaction of current support and maintenance payments until further order of the family court, notwithstanding any statutory limitation on executions issued against the wages, earnings, salary, or other income of the judgment debtor, and the execution shall have priority over any other executions.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> No employer shall discharge an employee because his or her wages are subject to execution in accordance with this section or shall discriminate in hiring because of a potential execution.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> An employer, in remitting wages levied upon a judgment or order of support, may make a two dollar ($2.00) deduction to defray his or her bookkeeping expenses for each paycheck levied upon out of the funds ordered for support.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> In any proceeding brought for failure to make support payments, upon a showing that the payments are more than forty-five (45) days overdue, the family court may grant an order directing that an execution issue against the interest of the responsible parent in and to any real estate or personal property within the jurisdiction of the family court whether that interest is held individually or jointly with others, and the execution shall have priority over any other executions or attachments except as prescribed by applicable federal or state statutes.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The execution shall attach to all real and personal property of the responsible parent when it is recorded with the recorder of deeds for the city or town in which the real estate is located or with the appropriate office for a notice with respect to personal property. The department of administration, division of taxation, child support enforcement agency, shall not be required to pay a recording fee.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Whenever an execution has been filed and there is in the possession of any person having notice of the execution any property which may be subject to the execution, the property shall not be paid over, released, sold, transferred, encumbered, or conveyed unless a release or waiver signed by the director has been delivered to the person in possession or the family court has ordered the release of the execution.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> Any person who fails to honor an execution shall be liable to the person entitled to receive the support payments in an amount equal to the debt, which is the basis of the execution, together with costs, interest, and reasonable attorney fees.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> Any judgment or order for support issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction of any other state, which passes legislation similar to this chapter and provides for reciprocity to this state, shall have the same force and effect as if the judgment or order originated from the Rhode Island courts.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> Interest at the rate of twelve (12%) per annum on any support debt due or owing may be assessed by operation of law unless the responsible parent shall, for good cause shown, be relieved of the obligation to pay the interest by the family court.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the Family Court has jurisdiction to entertain a child custody case, its exercise of that jurisdiction is improper, where the court’s action creates a situation that opens the door for jurisdictional conflict while prolonging resolution of a case that was settled in Florida over a decade earlier.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because an action seeking a divorce from bed and board was quasi in rem, a Rhode Island family court had jurisdiction to hear a petition where the petitioning spouse was a Rhode Island resident and to enter child custody orders where Rhode Island had become the children’s home state; due process concerns relating to the non-petitioning spouse’s minimum contacts with the state were not a concern in an action concerning the status of Rhode Island residents.

<p class="p6">The purpose of this chapter is to enhance the enforcement of support obligations by providing a swift and effective procedure for the withholding of income derived in this state to enforce support orders issued in this state or other jurisdictions, and by providing a mechanism by which income withholding, to enforce the support orders issued in this state, may be sought in other jurisdictions. This chapter shall be applicable to support obligations established or enforceable in this state, including support obligations enforceable pursuant to the Rhode Island state plan for child and spousal support enforcement, as the plan may be adopted and amended by the Rhode Island department of human services in accordance with title IV, part D, § 454 of the federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 654, and as more fully defined in § 15-16-2. This chapter shall be construed liberally to effect this purpose.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Rhode Island Legislature has expanded the equity jurisdiction of the Rhode Island Family Court with the intent to offer parties who have filed a petition for divorce, separation, or other relief in the Family Court, a comprehensive resolution of property, contractual, and equitable disputes that have arisen between them including the authority to hear and determine disputes arising out of antenuptial agreements. Wright v. Zielinski, 824 A.2d 494, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 157 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The party challenging the enforceability of a premarital agreement bears the burden of proving all the elements in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) by a “clear and convincing evidence” standard, under which the trier of fact must believe that the truth of the facts asserted by the proponent is highly probable. A finding of unconscionability does not provide a sufficient basis on which to refuse to enforce a premarital agreement because, under this chapter, proof of both involuntary execution and nondisclosure and/or waiver is required in addition to a finding of unconscionability. Penhallow v. Penhallow, 649 A.2d 1016, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 260 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice erred in concluding that § 15-5-16.1 should determine the rights and liabilities of the parties in a divorce action rather than the antenuptial agreement signed by them two days prior to the marriage, since there was no evidence of a written agreement amending or revoking the antenuptial agreement and nothing to prove the required elements under § 15-17-6 by clear and convincing evidence. Rubino v. Rubino, 765 A.2d 1222, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 44 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the boilerplate language used by counsel for both parties regarding equitable distribution could not overcome the unequivocal and specific attempts made by a former wife to enforce her rights under an antenuptial agreement, the trial justice was clearly wrong in finding as a fact that the wife had abandoned the agreement by accepting an advancement of $5,000. Rubino v. Rubino, 765 A.2d 1222, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 44 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Post-Divorce Actions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Rhode Island Family Court possessed jurisdiction to hear a husband’s breach of contract claim premised on his wife’s alleged breach of their prenuptial agreement under R.I. Gen. Laws § 8-10-3; therefore, husband’s post-divorce action, related to wife’s not alleging ante-nuptial agreement when she filed for divorce, was barred by res judicata in his subsequent action. Wright v. Zielinski, 824 A.2d 494, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 157 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Premarital Agreements.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a divorce action, the family court erred in finding that a premarital agreement was not valid, as plaintiff failed to establish the elements set forth in R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-17-6. Where defendant failed to fully disclose the value of his assets, the list of his assets contained in the agreement satisfied the requirements of the statute and unconscionability alone was not sufficient to invalidate the agreement; however, the agreement did not preclude the family court from assigning the appreciation in value or an interest in defendant’s property that increased in value as a result of the efforts of either spouse during the marriage under R.I. Gen. Laws § 15-5-16.1(b). Marsocci v. Marsocci, 911 A.2d 690, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 191 (R.I. 2006).</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a) (1)</b> Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, in any proceeding where the court has ordered either or both parents to pay any amount of the support of a minor child, upon an order to show cause or notice of motion, application, and declaration signed under penalty of perjury by the person to whom support has been ordered to have been paid stating that the parent or parents so ordered is in arrears in payment in a sum equal to the amount of sixty (60) days of payments, the court shall issue to the parent or parents ordered to pay support, following notice and opportunity for a hearing, an order requiring that the parent or parents deposit assets to secure future support payments with the family court clerk or any other trustee designated by the court. Upon request of any party the court may also issue an ex parte restraining order as specified in subsection (d) of this section. Upon deposit of any asset which is not readily convertible into money, the court may, not less than twenty (20) days after serving the obligor parent or parents with written notice and a hearing, order the sale of that asset or assets and the deposit of the proceeds with the person designated under this subsection. For purposes of the provisions of title 34, the date of the issuance of the order to deposit assets shall be construed as the date notice of levy on an interest in real property was served on the judgment debtor. When the asset ordered to be deposited is real property, the order shall be certified as judgment in accordance with the provisions of titles 8, 9, 10, and 34. A deposit of real property is made effective by recordation of a mortgage deed running to the family court clerk with the city or town recorder of deeds. The deposited real property and the rights, benefits, and liabilities attached to that property shall continue in the possession of the legal owner.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Upon an obligor parent’s failure, within the time specified by the court, to make reasonable efforts to cure the default in child support payments or to comply with a court approved payment plan, if payments continue in the arrears, the family court clerk or trustee designated by the court shall, not less than twenty-five (25) days after providing the obligor parent or parents with a written notice served personally or with return receipt requested, unless a motion or order to show cause has been filed to stop the use or sale, use the money or sell or otherwise process the deposited assets for an amount sufficient to pay the arrearage and the amount ordered by the court for the support, maintenance, and education of the minor child currently due.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Assets which have been deposited pursuant to an order issued in accordance with subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be construed as being assets subject to levy pursuant to the provisions of title 34. The sale of assets shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of title 34.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> The family court clerk or trustee designated by the court may deduct from the deposited money the sum of one dollar ($1.00) for each payment made pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> An obligor parent must rebut the presumptions that nonpayment of child support was willful, without good faith, and that the obligor had the ability to pay the support.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> An obligor parent may file a motion to stop the use of the money or the sale of the asset pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection within fifteen (15) days after service of notice on him or her pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection. The clerk of the court shall set the motion for a hearing not less than twenty (20) days after service on the person or county officer to whom support has been ordered to have been paid.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The court shall issue an order pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (a) upon a determination that one or more of the following conditions exists:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The obligor parent is not receiving salary or wages subject to an assignment pursuant to § 15-5-16.2; and there is reason to believe that he or she has earned income from some source of employment;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> An assignment of a portion of salary or wages pursuant to § 15-5-16.2 would not be sufficient to meet the amount of the support obligation, for reasons other than a change of circumstances which would qualify for a reduction in the amount of child support ordered;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The job history of the obligor parent shows that an assignment of a portion of salary or wages pursuant to § 15-5-16.2 would be difficult to enforce or would not be a practical means for securing the payment of the support obligation, due to circumstances including, but not limited to, multiple concurrent or consecutive employers.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The designation of assets subject to an order pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (a) shall be based upon concern for maximizing the liquidity and ready conversion into cash of the deposited asset. In all instances, the assets shall include a sum of money up to or equal in value to one year of support payments or six thousand dollars ($6,000), whichever is less, or any other assets, personal or real, designated by the court which equal in value up to one year of payments for support of the minor child, or any other amount in the discretion of the family court. In lieu of depositing cash or other assets as provided above, the obligor parent may, if approved by the court, provide a performance bond secured by any real property or other assets of the parent and equal in value to one year of payments.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> During the pendency of any proceeding pursuant to this chapter, and upon the application of either party in the manner provided by the provisions of title 34, the court may, without a hearing, issue ex parte orders restraining any person from transferring, encumbering, hypothecating, concealing, or in any way disposing of any property, real or personal, whether community, quasi-community, or separate, except in the usual course of business or for the necessities of life, and if the order is directed against a party, requiring him or her to notify the other party of any proposed extraordinary expenditures and to account to the court for all such extraordinary expenditures. The matter shall be made returnable not later than twenty (20) days, or if good cause appears to the court twenty-five (25) days, from the date of the order, at which time the ex parte order shall expire. Any order issued pursuant to this chapter shall state on its face the date of expiration of the order, which shall expire in one year or upon deposit of assets or money pursuant to subdivision (1) of subsection (a), whichever occurs first. The court, at the hearing, shall determine for which property the obligor parent shall be required to report extraordinary expenditures and shall specify what is deemed an extraordinary expenditure for purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The family court clerk or trustee designated by the court pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, who is responsible for any money or property and for any disbursements under this chapter, shall not be held liable for any action undertaken in good faith and in conformance with this chapter.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f) (1)</b> The family court clerk or trustee designated by the court shall return all assets subject to court order under subdivision (1) of subsection (a) to the obligor parent or parents when both of the following occur:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(i)</b> One year has elapsed since the court issued the order described under subdivision (1) of subsection (a); and</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> When the above criteria have been satisfied and when the deposited asset was real property, the family court clerk or trustee designated by the court shall prepare a release, and shall request the clerk of the court where the order to deposit assets was rendered to certify the release and record it in the office of the recorder of deeds in the city or town where the property is located.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> The family court clerk or trustee shall, if requested by the obligor parent, prepare a statement setting forth disbursements and receipts made under this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> If the family court clerk, trustee, or person designated under subsection (a) of this section incurs fees or costs under this chapter which are not compensated by the deduction under subdivision (3) of subsection (a), including, but not limited to, fees or costs incurred in any sale of assets pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and in the preparation of a statement pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, the court shall hear not less than twenty (20) days after service upon the obligor parent of the notice of motion or order to show cause by the family court clerk, trustee, or person designated under subsection (a) of this section incurring the fees or costs, and order the obligor parent or parents to pay reasonable fees and costs. Fees and costs ordered to be paid by the court under this subsection shall be in addition to any deposit made under subsection (a) of this section, but shall not exceed five percent (5%) of one year’s child support obligation or the total amount ordered deposited under subdivision (1) of subsection (a), whichever is less.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> The purpose of this chapter is to provide an extraordinary remedy for cases of bad faith failure to pay child support obligations.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> In any case where the department has perfected a lien pursuant to § 15-21-4, the department may collect unpaid child support and levy upon all property as provided in this section. The department shall have the authority to issue an administrative notice of levy or administrative writ of execution to effectuate a levy under this chapter of the law. The term “levy” includes the power of seizure by any means authorized by law. The department may seize and sell any property that is subject to levy. Any person in possession of property upon which a lien has been imposed shall, upon demand, surrender the property to the department.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> A levy on property held by an organization with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract shall, without necessity for the surrender of the contract document, constitute a demand by the department for payment of the amount of the lien and the exercise of the right of the obligor to the advance of that amount. The organization shall pay the amount within ninety (90) days after service of notice of levy. The levy shall be deemed to be satisfied if the organization pays over to the department the full amount which the obligor could have had advanced to him or her, provided that the amount does not exceed the amount of the lien.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Whenever any property upon which levy has been made is not sufficient to satisfy the claim of the state for which levy is made, the department may thereafter, as often as necessary, proceed to levy, with notice, upon any other personal property of the obligor liable to levy, until the amount due from him or her, together with expenses, is fully paid. In all cases, any support obligations shall be fully satisfied prior to payments for expenses.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Upon demand by the department, a person who fails or refuses to surrender personal property subject to levy shall be liable in his or her own person and estate to the state in a sum equal to the value of the property not so surrendered, but not exceeding the amount of the lien, together with costs and interest, at the rate authorized for civil judgments, from the date of the levy. In addition, any person required to surrender property who fails or refuses to surrender the property without reasonable cause shall be liable for a penalty equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount recoverable. The interest or penalty incurred under this subsection shall be paid to the general fund and shall not be credited against the child support liability. Any non-obligor party aggrieved by a decision of the department may, within ten (10) days of receipt of notice of demand, request an administrative hearing with the department.</p>

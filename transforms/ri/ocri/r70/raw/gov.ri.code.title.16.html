In lieu of a convenient location, the school committee may provide transportation for pupils to and from school in accordance with the provisions of chapter 21 of this title. Provided, that a school district may establish a school year that is the equivalent of one hundred eighty (180) days through the use of longer school days in terms of hours or pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and that may total less than one hundred eighty (180) separate days, so long as through the use of the longer school day, the school district annually provides a minimum of one thousand eighty (1,080) school hours in a single school year. This figure is based on a minimum of six (6) hours per school day. For purposes of clarification, the intent herein is to permit school districts to amend their school year to provide for longer school days while reducing the actual number of days in which the school facilities must be fully staffed and maintained, but to insure that in doing so, school districts shall still provide the minimum amount of instruction time contemplated by this section. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit a school district from exceeding the minimum amounts of days and hours set forth herein.</p>

The commissioner may grant or deny approval of the plan and/or the calendar.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> School facilities shall include a sufficient number of kindergartens.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> On or before December 1, 2017, the department of elementary and secondary education shall establish a policy that allows a school district to submit a detailed plan, at any time, to the commissioner of elementary and secondary education that would allow the schools to conduct instruction through virtual education when the schools have been closed due to inclement weather or other emergency. The plan for virtual education would be subject to, and require approval by, the council on elementary and secondary education in order to count as a school day.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Bargaining Powers.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Evaluation of Programs.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A school committee can negotiate many items with the professional and nonprofessional employees of the system, but it cannot bargain away statutory powers and responsibilities. Because evaluating the education of limited English proficient students’ programs and determining whether they conform with state law and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education requires understanding the requirements of state law, it cannot be submitted to arbitration. Pawtucket Sch. Comm. v. Pawtucket Teachers' Alliance, Local No. 930, 652 A.2d 970, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 16 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Arbitration award entered in favor of a union was properly confirmed because the arbitrator did not act in manifest disregard of state law when he found that a school committee’s decision to terminate a composition period for English teachers at a high school did not constitute an educational policy decision but rather was a workload decision that constituted a term and condition of employment. N. Providence Sch. Comm. v. N. Providence Fed'n of Teachers, Local 920, 945 A.2d 339, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Caruolo Action Untimely.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the appeal brought by a city school committee and its superintendent (collectively referred to as the committee), challenging a judgment in favor of the members of the city’s council, its mayor, and its director of finance (collectively referred to as the city) in a suit wherein the committee sought additional appropriations for the fiscal year of 2007-2008, pursuant to the Caruolo Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 16-2-21, in what is commonly referred to as a Caruolo action, the judgment in favor of the city was upheld since the trial justice correctly interpreted § 16-2-21.4 as requiring that a Caruolo action be brought in a timely manner from when a school committee discovers that it cannot operate in a non-deficit position while complying with its mandates and contracts. The Supreme Court held that it was contrary to the intent of the Rhode Island Legislature to allow a school committee to knowingly incur an end of the year deficit where corrective action can no longer be taken, only to be appropriated additional funds under the Caruolo Act, which was the inappropriate course of action that the committee was found to have undertaken, thus, the trial justice appropriately applied the doctrine of laches to the case.

The appellate court also held that the school committee was a department of the town and, therefore, was required to abide by the town’s charter, which required all legal matters for any of the town’s departments, agencies, or offices to be handled by the town solicitor.

A disruptive student is a person who is subject to compulsory school attendance, who exhibits persistent conduct which substantially impedes the ability of other students to learn, or otherwise substantially interferes with the rights stated above, and who has failed to respond to corrective and rehabilitative measures presented by staff, teachers, or administrators.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The school committee, or a school principal as designated by the school committee, may suspend all pupils found guilty of this conduct, or of violation of those school regulations which relate to the rights set forth in subsection (a), or where a student represents a threat to those rights of students, teachers, or administrators, as described in subsection (a). Nothing in this section shall relieve the school committee or school principals from following all procedures required by state and federal law regarding discipline of students with disabilities.</p>

Any decision of the commissioner in these matters shall be subject to appeal by the student to the board of regents for elementary and secondary education and any decision of the board of regents may be appealed by the student to the family court for the county in which the school is located as provided in § 42-35-15.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> All school superintendents, or their designees, shall review annually, the discipline data for their school district, collected in accordance with the specifications set forth in § 16-60-4(21), to determine whether the discipline imposed has a disproportionate impact on students based on race, ethnicity, or disability status and to appropriately respond to any such disparity. In addition to the data submitted, if a disparity exists, the school district shall submit a report to the council on elementary and secondary education describing the conduct of the student, the frequency of the conduct, prior disciplinary actions for the conduct, any other relevant information and corrective actions to address the disparity, after consultation with representatives of the faculty has been taken to address the disparity.

Gen. Laws § 16-2-21, in what is commonly referred to as a Caruolo action, the judgment in favor of the city was upheld since the trial justice correctly interpreted § 16-2-21.4 as requiring that a Caruolo action be brought in a timely manner from when a school committee discovers that it cannot operate in a non-deficit position while complying with its mandates and contracts. The Supreme Court held that it was contrary to the intent of the Rhode Island Legislature to allow a school committee to knowingly incur an end of the year deficit where corrective action can no longer be taken, only to be appropriated additional funds under the Caruolo Act, which was the inappropriate course of action that the committee was found to have undertaken, thus, the trial justice appropriately applied the doctrine of laches to the case.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the appeal brought by a city school committee and its superintendent (collectively referred to as the committee), challenging a judgment in favor of the members of the city’s council, its mayor, and its director of finance (collectively referred to as the city) in a suit wherein the committee sought additional appropriations for the fiscal year of 2007-2008, pursuant to the Caruolo Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 16-2-21, in what is commonly referred to as a Caruolo action, the judgment in favor of the city was upheld since the trial justice correctly interpreted § 16-2-21.4 as requiring that a Caruolo action be brought in a timely manner from when a school committee discovers that it cannot operate in a non-deficit position while complying with its mandates and contracts. The Supreme Court held that it was contrary to the intent of the Rhode Island Legislature to allow a school committee to knowingly incur an end of the year deficit where corrective action can no longer be taken, only to be appropriated additional funds under the Caruolo Act, which was the inappropriate course of action that the committee was found to have undertaken, thus, the trial justice appropriately applied the doctrine of laches to the case.

The chairperson of the city, town, or regional school committee, in accordance with the provisions of § 16-2-9, shall be required to petition the commissioner, in writing, to seek alternatives for the district to comply with state regulations and/or provide waivers to state regulations and, in particular, those which are more restrictive than federal regulations that allow the school committee to operate with a balanced budget. Waivers which affect the health and safety of students and staff or which violate the provisions of chapter 24 of this title shall not be granted. The commissioner must consider alternatives for districts to comply with regulations and/or provide waivers to regulations in order that the school committee may operate with a balanced budget within the previously authorized appropriation. In the petition to the commissioner, the school committee shall be required to identify the alternatives to meet regulations and/or identify the waivers it seeks in order to provide the commissioner with the revised budget which allows it to have a balanced budget within the previously authorized appropriation. The commissioner shall respond within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of the written petition from the school committee. If the commissioner does not approve of the alternatives to meet regulations or the waivers from regulations which are sought by the school committee, or if the commissioner does not approve of the modified expenditure plan submitted by the school committee, then: (1) within ten (10) days of receiving the commissioner’s response, the school committee may submit a written request to the city or town council for the council of the municipality to decide whether to increase the appropriation for schools to meet expenditures. The decision to increase any appropriations shall be conducted pursuant to the local charter or the public law controlling the approval of appropriations within the municipality; or (2) in a regional school district, the chairperson of the school committee may, within ten (10) days of receiving the commissioner’s response, submit a written request to the chief elected official of each of the municipalities to request that the city or town council in each of their respective towns meet to decide whether or not to increase the appropriation for schools to meet expenditures.

In no event shall any court order obtained by the school committee have force and effect for any period longer than the fiscal year for which the litigation is brought. Any action filed pursuant to this section shall be set down for a hearing at the earliest possible time and shall be given precedence over all matters except older matters of the same character.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> A collaborative approach to the dual mission of educational effectiveness and business efficiency is the purpose of this educational collaborative act. The goal is to maximize both educational effectiveness and business services which will lead to cost savings. The educational collaborative system will allow school districts to more appropriately concentrate on educating at the most local level, which should be their prime mission. This system can be defined as including not only the regional educational collaboratives and their boards, local district school committees and district superintendents, operating as private, nonprofit educational service agencies, but also the board of regents and the commissioner of the Rhode Island department of elementary and secondary education.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> As used herein, the terms “collaborative,” “educational collaborative,” “regional collaborative,” and combinations thereof, shall be deemed to refer to the collaboratives established pursuant to this chapter, and recognized as 501(c)3 nonprofit corporations incorporated pursuant to the Rhode Island Nonprofit Corporation Act, Rhode Island general laws § 7-6-1, et seq. Nothing in this legislation is intended to erode the legal status of the regional collaboratives as 501(c)3’s and their boards of directors must be cognizant to their legal and fiduciary responsibilities to these enterprises.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The purpose of this act is also to bring the efforts of the members of the educational collaborative system, listed in subsection (a) above, into appropriate and productive dialogue and relationship with one another, in order to bring about the business efficiencies and quality instructional practice the legislature desires.</p>

<p class="p6">As part of the effort to transform education in Rhode Island, the general assembly is committed to developing and supporting strategies that foster cultures of excellence, innovation, and continuous improvement in Rhode Island schools. The general assembly believes that all district schools benefit from effective leadership, strong labor/management collaboration, strong community support and engagement, and the autonomy and flexibility to continuously improve instruction and implement and adopt strategies that meet the needs of their students. The general assembly therefore in this act establishes empowerment schools, which shall remain within a public-school district, under the district leadership of the superintendent and school committee, but which shall be managed collaboratively on site by the principal and the faculty, as an additional opportunity for supporting more high-performing and innovative schools within the Rhode Island system of public education. A school that volunteers to be an empowerment school, as defined in this chapter, shall have unprecedented levels of regulatory and statutory flexibility; school-based autonomy, including autonomy over budget; flexibility in school-based instructional policies and professional practices defined through shared leadership; and be uniquely positioned to create compelling learning environments responsive to increased student and parent/family empowerment. Similarly, in this act, the general assembly establishes the affirmative right for students and their parents/families to enroll in an empowerment school that is different than their assigned school based on residence, in order to seek innovative instructional policies and practices that best match their learning needs, so long as the empowerment school has elected, as part of its empowerment plan, to accept students from other schools within the student’s district of residence.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all statute regulations, and collective bargaining agreement terms and conditions shall apply to empowerment schools.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Notwithstanding §§ 16-2-9 and 16-2-11, the principal and professional staff of a empowerment school, acting in concert as a school leadership team, shall make decisions regarding the school’s policies and practices, including, but not limited to, curriculum, instructional practices, policies and procedures, calendar and schedule, allocation of resources, staffing, and professional development, consistent with the district collective bargaining agreement and school-based amendments as defined in § 16-3.2-4(f). Leadership teams shall determine methods to document and communicate the latest decisions that emerge through the leadership team process. Noncertified staff, parents, students, and community members may also be members of the school leadership team at the school’s discretion. The principal shall have final authority in all instructional, personnel, managerial, and operational matters, except for those matters expressly delegated to the school leadership team through the participatory leadership process, consistent with the district collective bargaining agreement and school-based amendments as defined in § 16-3.2-4(f).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Students from the district in which the empowerment school is located shall be funded either pursuant to §§ 16-3.2-7 and 16-7.2-5 or, based on mutual, written agreement between the superintendent and the principal of the empowerment school, in accordance with an alternative agreement with the school district.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Teachers and other staff who work in empowerment schools shall maintain their full status as members of their respective bargaining unit and as employees of the district and service in an empowerment school shall not be deemed to be an interruption of service in the school district for purposes of seniority and teachers’ retirement.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Although existing collective bargaining agreements shall apply to an empowerment school, empowerment schools shall be eligible to amend the existing districtwide collective bargaining agreement through an expedited and timely process, subject to approval of the superintendent, district union membership, and school committee. School-based amendments to the districtwide collective bargaining agreement shall be non-precedent setting for future district bargaining or contract administration. In all instances, final approval or non-approval by all parties of school-based amendments to the districtwide collective bargaining agreement shall be made within ninety (90) days of submission of such request.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The commissioner of elementary and secondary education shall develop a process for a public school, with the approval of its superintendent and school committee, to be designated as an empowerment school with the duties, responsibilities, and autonomies set forth in this chapter. Said process shall also address the manner in which a school and its school committee can convert an empowerment school back to a traditional public school. No existing public school shall be converted into an empowerment school or back to a traditional public school unless two-thirds (2/3) of the full-time professional staff currently assigned to the eligible entity described in § 16-3.2-4 approve the proposal. The empowerment school application process and timeline shall be determined by the commissioner and include information including, but not limited to, the vision for the empowerment school; the means it will use to improve school performance and student achievement; performance criteria that will be used to measure student learning at least sufficient to participate in the state accountability plan; a plan for the governance, administration, and operation of the empowerment school; whether the school will be funded via §§ 16-3.2-7 and 16-7.2-5 or through an alternative written agreement between the superintendent and the principal of the empowerment school; and the state statutes, state regulations, contract provisions, and school district rules from which variances or waivers are sought in order to facilitate operation of the empowerment school. The application shall include a description of the authority of the principal and how employment decisions of the principal would impact the teacher and staff assignment process within a school district.</p>
<p class="p6">In order to facilitate statewide innovation, approved empowerment school plans shall be posted publicly.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Upon deeming an application to be satisfactory, the superintendent and school committee shall transmit its approval of the designation to the commissioner of elementary and secondary education, who shall then register the school as an empowerment school subject to the duties, responsibilities, and autonomies of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6">Nothing in this chapter shall require an empowerment school to include all of the provisions of this chapter in its locally approved plan. In other words, empowerment plans may include only a locally determined subset of the provisions made possible by this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6">Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the creation of school-based amendment to the district collective bargaining agreement, as defined in § 16-3.2-4(f), to incorporate all or part of the empowerment plan into the local collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> If the designation of an empowerment school is approved by the superintendent and school committee, it shall be authorized to operate for a period of up to three (3) years. The empowerment school plan may be modified as necessary during its period of authorization and may be renewed for increments up to three (3) years utilizing the same process outlined herein for initial designation and registration.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Upon registration of the empowerment school designation by the commissioner of elementary and secondary education, the commissioner shall be deemed to have authorized all necessary variances from statutes and regulations enumerated in the application.</p>

Provided, that for the fiscal years 2010 and 2011 each community shall contribute to its school committee in an amount not less than ninety-five percent (95.0%) of its local contribution for schools for the fiscal year 2009. Calculation of the annual local contribution shall not include Medicaid revenues received by the municipality or district pursuant to chapter 8 of title 40. A community that has a decrease in enrollment may compute maintenance of effort on a per-pupil rather than on an aggregate basis when determining its local contribution; furthermore, a community that experiences a nonrecurring expenditure for its schools may deduct the nonrecurring expenditure in computing its maintenance of effort. The deduction of nonrecurring expenditures shall be with the approval of the commissioner.

Gen. Laws § 16-2-21, in what is commonly referred to as a Caruolo action, the judgment in favor of the city was upheld since the trial justice correctly interpreted § 16-2-21.4 as requiring that a Caruolo action be brought in a timely manner from when a school committee discovers that it cannot operate in a non-deficit position while complying with its mandates and contracts. The Supreme Court held that it was contrary to the intent of the Rhode Island Legislature to allow a school committee to knowingly incur an end of the year deficit where corrective action can no longer be taken, only to be appropriated additional funds under the Caruolo Act, which was the inappropriate course of action that the committee was found to have undertaken, thus, the trial justice appropriately applied the doctrine of laches to the case.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> In each fiscal year the state shall pay to each community a grant to be applied to the cost of school housing equal to the following:</p>
<p class="p6">The cost of each new school housing project certified to the commissioner of elementary and secondary education not later than July 15 of the fiscal year shall be divided by the actual number of years of the bond issued by the local community or the Rhode Island health and educational building corporation in support of the specific project, times the school housing aid ratio; and provided, further, with respect to costs of new school projects financed with proceeds of bonds issued by the local community or the Rhode Island health and educational building corporation in support of the specific project, the amount of the school housing aid payable in each fiscal year shall not exceed the amount arrived at by multiplying the principal and interest of the bonds payable in each fiscal year by the school housing aid ratio and which principal and interest amount over the life of the bonds, shall, in no event, exceed the costs of each new school housing project certified to the commissioner of elementary and secondary education. If a community fails to specify or identify the appropriate reimbursement schedule, the commissioner of elementary and secondary education may at his or her discretion set up to a five (5) year reimbursement cycle for projects under five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000); up to ten (10) years for projects up to three million dollars ($3,000,000); and up to twenty (20) years for projects over three million dollars ($3,000,000).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Aid shall be provided for the same period as the life of the bonds issued in support of the project and at the school housing aid ratio applicable to the local community as set forth in § 16-7-39 at the time the project is approved by the council on elementary and secondary education.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Aid shall be paid either to the community or in the case of projects financed through the Rhode Island health and educational building corporation, to the Rhode Island health and educational building corporation or its designee including, but not limited to, a trustee under a bond indenture or loan and trust agreement, in support of bonds issued for specific projects of the local community in accordance with this section, § 16-7-40 and § 16-7-44. Notwithstanding the preceding, in case of failure of any city, town, or district to pay the amount due in support of bonds issued on behalf of a city, town, school or district project financed by the Rhode Island health and educational building corporation, upon notification by the Rhode Island health and educational building corporation, the general treasurer shall deduct the amount from aid provided under this section, § 16-7-40, § 16-7-44 and § 16-7-15 through § 16-7-34.3 due the city, town, or district and direct said funding to the Rhode Island health and educational building corporation or its designee.</p>

In connection with any such refunding of bonds, the finance director or the chief financial officer of the community shall certify such net interest savings to the commissioner of elementary and secondary education. Notwithstanding § 16-7-44 or any other provision of law to the contrary, school housing projects costs in connection with any such refunding bond issue shall include bond issuance costs incurred by the community, the municipal public buildings authority, or the Rhode Island health and educational building corporation, as the case may be, in connection therewith. In connection with any refunding bond issue, school housing project costs shall include the cost of interest payments on such refunding bonds, if the cost of interest payments was included as a school housing cost for the bonds being refunded. A local community or municipal public buildings authority shall not be entitled to the benefits of this subsection (d) unless the net present value savings resulting from the refunding is at least three percent (3%) of the refunded bond issue.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the commissioner of elementary and secondary education shall cause to be monitored the potential for refunding outstanding bonds of local communities or municipal public building authorities or of the Rhode Island health and educational building corporation issued for the benefit of local communities or municipal public building authorities and benefiting from any aid referenced in this section. In the event it is determined by said monitoring that the net present value savings which could be achieved by refunding such bonds of the type referenced in the prior sentence including any direct costs normally associated with such refundings is equal to (i) at least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and (ii) for the state and the communities or public building authorities at least three percent (3%) of the bond issue to be refunded including associated costs then, in such event, the commissioner (or his or her designee) may direct the local community or municipal public building authority for the benefit of which the bonds were issued, to refund such bonds. Failure of the local community or municipal public buildings authority to timely refund such bonds, except due to causes beyond the reasonable control of such local community or municipal public building authority, shall result in the reduction by the state of the aid referenced in this § 16-7-41 associated with the bonds directed to be refunded in an amount equal to ninety percent (90%) of the net present value savings reasonably estimated by the commissioner of elementary and secondary education (or his or her designee) which would have been achieved had the bonds directed to be refunded been refunded by the ninetieth (90th) day (or if such day is not a business day in the state of Rhode Island, the next succeeding business day) following the date of issuance of the directive of the commissioner (or his or her designee) to refund such bonds. Such reduction in the aid shall begin in the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the commissioner issued such directive for the remaining term of the bond.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Payments shall be made in accordance with § 16-7-40 and this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> For purposes of financing or refinancing school facilities in the city of Central Falls through the issuance of bonds through the Rhode Island health and educational building corporation, the city of Central Falls shall be considered an “educational institution” within the meaning of § 45-38.1-3(13).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(i)</b> Closing the inequitable resource gaps among school districts and schools;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(ii)</b> Closing inequitable gaps in performance and achievement among different groups of students, especially those correlated with poverty, gender, and language background;</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(iv)</b> Establishing a predictable method of distributing state education aid in a manner that addresses the over-reliance on the property tax to finance education.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> This legislation is further designed to accelerate the implementation of the State Comprehensive Education Strategy. The strategy is an action plan for ensuring that all children achieve at high levels and become lifelong learners, productive workers, and responsible citizens. The standard for expected student achievement is currently being set at a high level both by the board of regents and in Rhode Island’s districts and schools. High standards must be supported and these expectations must now be reached by all our students. All the state’s children must enjoy the success that comes with proficiency in skill and knowledge.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> <b>Evaluation of success.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Improved student and school performance is the key measure of the success of Rhode Island’s schools. This success cannot occur without investment based on the four (4) fundamental principles as stated in subsection (a) of this section. The success of these investments shall be evaluated based on: accountability for student and school performance; accountability in terms of whether the state’s investment is sufficiently adequate and equitable to support improvement in performance; and on accountability for district and school expenditures.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The board of regents shall adopt and publish statewide standards of performance and performance benchmarks in core subject areas, to include writing and mathematics (grades four (4), eight (8), and ten (10)). These standards and performance benchmarks shall be ratified by the board and implemented and performance standards and performance benchmarks for reading in two (2) grades shall be added.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Districts and schools need to be held accountable for student performance results. Therefore, every school district receiving state education aid under this title shall develop a district strategic plan. The district strategic plan shall: (1) Be based on high academic standards for student performance consistent with the statewide standards and benchmarks; (2) Be the product of a shared communitywide process that defines a vision of what students should know and be able to do; (3) Address the needs of each school in the district; (4) Encourage the development of school-based improvement planning and implementation; (5) Include a process for mentoring of new teachers; (6) Be designed to improve student achievement with emphasis on closing the performance gaps among groups of students, such as the performance gaps correlated with poverty, gender, language background, and disability; (7) Include establishment of student intervention teams to address the instructional needs of diverse learners, include high standards of student behavior designed to create an orderly educational environment with due regard for the rights of students, and an asset protection plan; and (8) Be consistent with Rhode Island’s comprehensive education strategy. In order to ensure the most efficient use of resources implementing strategic plans, districts and schools are encouraged to work together as consortia and as part of the regional collaboratives.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c) (1)</b> The strategic plan shall include strategies to improve the performance of students in mathematics, reading, and writing. Each plan must describe a scientific research-based, as described in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Title 1, Part B, § 1208 [20 U.S.C. § 6368], reading instruction to improve the reading skills of all students in the early grades (kindergarten through grade five (5)) that is aligned with the board of regents reading policy. The district must develop, implement, and evaluate a personal literacy program for each student in these grades who is performing below grade level. These strategies shall be based on the adequate yearly progress expected for students and schools. Annual performance targets for determining whether schools and districts have made adequate yearly progress will be set by the commissioner of elementary and secondary education. The general assembly expects these district strategies to increase the number of fourth grade students performing at, or above, the proficient standard in mathematics, reading, and writing in each district and school. The increase shall be established annually in accordance with § 16-7.1-4.</p>

It endorses the National Standards for School Counseling Programs as developed by the American School Counselor Association (ASCA). Further, the general assembly encourages every district to implement a K-12 standards-based, comprehensive, developmental school counseling program. The general assembly further encourages every district to provide professional development opportunities for school counselors that focus on best practices in collaborating with business, industry, and other community organizations to create internships and apprenticeships for secondary students.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Each strategic plan must indicate the manner in which self-studies will be completed at the school level in accordance with guidelines established by the commissioner. Funds shall be appropriated to the department of elementary and secondary education to assist districts with on-site reviews. Schools to be visited shall be determined by the commissioner.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Each strategic plan must indicate the method in which school administrators and staff shall achieve and maintain an orderly educational environment in accordance with due process and with due regard for the rights of students.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Each strategic plan shall include the development of inter-agency agreements for the coordination of services among state and local agencies responsible for service to children and families. These agreements shall address the identification and provision of services to pre-school children with disabilities and children and youth with behavioral healthcare needs.</p>

These strategies shall initially focus on: (1) technical assistance in improvement planning, curriculum alignment, student assessment, instruction, and family and community involvement; (2) policy support; (3) resource oversight to assess and recommend that each school has adequate resources necessary to meet performance goal; and (4) creating supportive partnerships with education institutions, business, governmental, or other appropriate nonprofit agencies. If after a three (3) year period of support there has not been improvement in the education of students as determined by objective criteria to be developed by the board of regents, then there shall be progressive levels of control by the department of elementary and secondary education over the school and/or district budget, program, and/or personnel. This control by the department of elementary and secondary education may be exercised in collaboration with the school district and the municipality. If further needed, the school shall be reconstituted. Reconstitution responsibility is delegated to the board of regents and may range from restructuring the school’s governance, budget, program, personnel, and/or may include decisions regarding the continued operation of the school. The board of regents shall assess the district’s capacity and may recommend the provision of additional district, municipal and/or state resources. If a school or school district is under the board of regents’ control as a result of actions taken by the board pursuant to this section, the local school committee shall be responsible for funding that school or school district at the same level as in the prior academic year increased by the same percentage as the state total of school aid is increased.</p>

<p class="p6">The general assembly recognizes that Rhode Island cities and towns primarily rely on the local property tax to finance education programs, and that the state’s highest effective property tax rates are concentrated in the state’s urban communities. Therefore, certain communities, because of low tax capacity and high tax effort, are unable to appropriate sufficient funds for the support of core instructional programs. The general assembly also recognizes the need to reduce inequities in resource distribution among the state’s cities and towns as well as among the state’s districts and schools. Therefore, the general assembly establishes the Core Instructional Equity Fund to improve the capacity of cities and towns to support the core instruction activities that are the basis of daily teaching and learning in all classrooms.

The general assembly shall annually appropriate some sum and distribute it based on a pupil-teacher ratio that shall be adjusted annually by the commissioner of elementary and secondary education. School districts, including collaboratives established pursuant to chapter 3.1 of this title, may use funds received under this category of education aid to replace up to, but no more than, fifty percent (50%) of the amount the school district spent for professional development programs in the previous fiscal year. The expenditure of these funds shall be determined by a committee at each school consisting of the school principal, two (2) teachers selected by the teaching staff of the school, and two (2) parents of students attending the school. Schools that enroll students in the early grades (kindergarten through grade three (3)) must expend these funds on the development of scientific research based, as described in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Title 1, Part B, Section 1208 [20 U.S.C. § 6368], reading instruction to improve students reading performance.</p>

The general assembly shall annually appropriate some sum and distribute it based on each district’s proportion of their average daily membership for grades kindergarten through and including third grade in the reference year as defined in § 16-7-16 relative to the statewide average daily membership for the same grades in the same fiscal year. For purposes of this section, average daily membership for grades kindergarten through and including third grade is determined in § 16-7-22. These resources shall be used to close student performance gaps in accordance with the district’s strategic plan pursuant to § 16-7.1-2. These early childhood investment funds shall be used in coordination with the literacy set-aside funds, chapter 67 of this title. In addition, these funds may be used for early childhood pilot programs, including Child Opportunity Zones (COZs), that; (1) combine and/or leverage some or all of the following state, federal and/or local funds insofar as allowable: student equity investment fund; literacy set-aside; special education funds; Title I funds; and any other appropriate funds; (2) that focus on beginning to improve student performance through developmentally appropriate early childhood education and integrated social and health service support. Funding emphasis for early childhood programs shall be given by the districts to the schools serving concentrations of at-risk students and shall be integrated with programs for special needs students; all day kindergarten programs may be funded; and school links shall be made with programs and students to facilitate full assessment of students’ school readiness and needs prior to entry into first grade and to help receiving schools meet the entering child’s needs.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The general assembly recognizes the need for an equitable distribution of resources among the state’s school districts, property tax relief and a predicable method of distributing education aid. The general assembly finds that there is a need to reform the way public education is financed because:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> All children should have access to an adequate and meaningful education regardless of their residence or economic means;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> A school funding system should treat property taxpayers equably, limit the portion of school budgets financed by property taxes, and establish sufficient cost controls on school spending;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The state should ensure that its school funding structure adequately reflects the different needs of students, and closes the educational inequities among the state’s school districts; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> The state education funding system should provide a predicable amount and source of funding to ensure stability in the funding of schools.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The intent of this chapter is to promote a school finance system in Rhode Island that is predicated on student need and taxpayer ability to pay. A new school funding system in the state should promote educational equity for all students and reduce the reliance on the property tax to fund public education. This legislation is intended to ensure educational opportunity to each pupil in each city or town on substantially equal terms. Adequate per pupil support will be provided through a combination of state school aid and local education property tax levies.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Charter public schools, as defined in chapter 77 of this title, the William M. Davies, Jr. Career and Technical High School (Davies), and the Metropolitan Regional Career and Technical Center (the Met Center) shall be funded pursuant to § 16-7.2-3. If the October 1 actual enrollment data for any charter public school shows a ten percent (10%) or greater change from the prior year enrollment that is used as the reference year average daily membership, the last six (6) monthly payments to the charter public school will be adjusted to reflect actual enrollment. The state share of the permanent foundation education aid shall be paid by the state directly to the charter public schools, Davies, and the Met Center pursuant to § 16-7.2-9 and shall be calculated using the state-share ratio of the district of residence of the student as set forth in § 16-7.2-4. The department of elementary and secondary education shall provide the general assembly with the calculation of the state share of permanent foundation education aid for charter public schools delineated by school district.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The local share of education funding shall be paid to the charter public school, Davies, and the Met Center by the district of residence of the student and shall be the local, per-pupil cost calculated by dividing the local appropriation to education from property taxes, net of debt service, and capital projects, as defined in the uniform chart of accounts by the average daily membership for each city and town, pursuant to § 16-7-22, for the reference year.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Beginning in FY 2017, there shall be a reduction to the local per-pupil funding paid by the district of residence to charter public schools, Davies, and the Met Center. This reduction shall be equal to the greater (i) Of seven percent (7%) of the local, per-pupil funding of the district of residence pursuant to subsection (b) or (ii) The per-pupil value of the district’s costs for non-public textbooks, transportation for non-public students, retiree health benefits, out-of-district special-education tuition and transportation, services for students age eighteen (18) to twenty-one (21) years old, pre-school screening and intervention, and career and technical education, tuition and transportation costs, debt service and rental costs minus the average expenses incurred by charter schools for those same categories of expenses as reported in the uniform chart of accounts for the prior preceding fiscal year pursuant to § 16-7-16(11) and verified by the department of elementary and secondary education. In the case where audited financials result in a change in the calculation after the first tuition payment is made, the remaining payments shall be based on the most recent audited data. For those districts whose greater reduction occurs under the calculation of (ii), there shall be an additional reduction to payments to mayoral academies with teachers who do not participate in the state teacher’s retirement system under chapter 8 of title 36 equal to the per-pupil value of teacher retirement costs attributable to unfunded liability as calculated by the state’s actuary for the prior preceding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Local district payments to charter public schools, Davies, and the Met Center for each district’s students enrolled in these schools shall be made on a quarterly basis in July, October, January, and April; however, the first local-district payment shall be made by August 15, instead of July. Failure of the community to make the local-district payment for its student(s) enrolled in a charter public school, Davies, and/or the Met Center may result in the withholding of state education aid pursuant to § 16-7-31.</p>

Aid in FY 2017 shall be equal to the number of charter public school, open-enrollment schools, Davies, or the Met Center students as of the reference year as defined in § 16-7-16 times a per-pupil amount of one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175). Aid in FY 2018 shall be equal to the number of charter public school, open-enrollment schools, Davies, or the Met Center students as of the reference year as defined in § 16-7-16 times a per-pupil amount of one hundred dollars ($100). Aid in FY 2019 shall be equal to the number of charter public school, open-enrollment schools, Davies, or the Met Center students as of the reference year as defined in § 16-7-16 times a per-pupil amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

For FY 2022, aid shall be equal to the number of new students being served as determined by the difference between the reference year as defined in § 16-7-16 and FY 2019 times a per-pupil amount of five hundred dollars ($500). For FY 2023 and thereafter, aid shall be equal to the number of new students being served as determined by the difference between the reference year as defined in § 16-7-16 and the prior reference year times a per-pupil amount of five hundred dollars ($500).

<p class="p6">No person shall be employed to teach, as principal or assistant, in any school supported wholly or in part by public money unless the person shall have a certificate of qualification issued by or under the authority of the board of regents for elementary and secondary education. Provided, however, that any person who is employed as a part time speech and language pathologist at the Rhode Island School for the Deaf, for a period of not less than ten (10) years prior to July 11, 1990, shall not be required to have a certificate of qualification, and shall be exempt from the provisions of this section which require the certificate. In case any city or town shall pay or cause to be paid any of the public money to any person for teaching who did not, at the time of teaching, hold a certificate, then the department of elementary and secondary education shall deduct a sum equal to the amount so paid from the amount of the state’s money due, or which may thereafter become due, to the city or town, before giving his or her order in favor of the city or town for any of the public money under the provisions of §§ 16-1-10, 16-1-11, and 16-5-22.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The interstate agreement on qualification of education personnel is enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein, in the form substantially as follows:</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>INTERSTATE AGREEMENT ON QUALIFICATION OF EDUCATIONAL PERSONNEL ARTICLE I Purpose, Findings, and Policy 1. The states party to this agreement, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education, and of the teaching profession. It is the purpose of this agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the states party to it, and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end. 2. The party states find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations. Variations from state to state in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other states. As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems. Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their states of origin, can increase the available educational resources. Participation in this compact can increase the availability of educational manpower. ARTICLE II Definitions As used in this agreement and contracts made pursuant to it, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: 1. “Educational personnel” means persons who must meet requirements pursuant to state law as a condition of employment in educational programs. 2. “Designated state official” means the education official of a state selected by that state to negotiate and enter into, on behalf of his state, contracts pursuant to this agreement. 3. “Accept,” or any variant thereof, means to recognize and give effect to one or more determinations of another state relating to the qualifications of education personnel in lieu of making or requiring a like determination that would otherwise be required by or pursuant to the laws of a receiving state. 4. “State” means a state, territory, or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 5. “Originating state” means a state (and the subdivision thereof, if any) whose determination that certain educational personnel are qualified to be employed for specific duties in schools is acceptable in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to article III. 6. “Receiving state” means a state (and the subdivisions thereof) which accept educational personnel in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to article III. ARTICLE III Interstate Educational Personnel Contracts 1. The designated state official of a party state may make one or more contracts on behalf of his state with one or more other party states providing for the acceptance of educational personnel. Any such contract for the period of its duration shall be applicable to and binding on the states who designated state officials enter into it, and the subdivisions of those states, with the same force and effect as if incorporated in this agreement. A designated state official may enter into a contract pursuant to this article only with states in which he finds that there are programs of education, certification standards or other acceptable qualifications that assure preparation or qualification of educational personnel on a basis sufficiently comparable, even though not identical to that prevailing in his own state. 2. Any such contract shall provide for: (a) Its duration. (b) The criteria to be applied by an originating state in qualifying educational personnel for acceptance by a receiving state. (c) Such waivers, substitutions, and conditional acceptances as shall aid the practical effectuation of the contract without sacrifice of basic educational standards. (d) Any other necessary matters. 3. No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall be for a term longer than five (5) years but any such contract may be renewed for like or lesser periods. 4. Any contract dealing with acceptance of educational personnel on the basis of their having completed an educational program shall specify the earliest date or dates on which originating state approval of the program or programs involved can have occurred. No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall require acceptance by a receiving state of any persons qualified because of successful completion of a program prior to January 1, 1954. 5. The certification or other acceptance of a person who has been accepted pursuant to the terms of a contract shall not be revoked or otherwise impaired because the contract has expired or been terminated. However, any certificate or other qualifying document may be revoked or suspended on any ground which would be sufficient for revocation or suspension of a certificate or other qualifying document initially granted or approved in the receiving state. 6. A contract committee composed of the designated state officials of the contracting states or their representatives shall keep the contract under continuous review, study means of improving its administration, and report no less frequently than once a year to the heads of the appropriate education agencies of the contracting states. ARTICLE IV Approved and Accepted Programs 1. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to repeal or otherwise modify any law or regulation or a party state relating to the approval of programs of educational preparation having effect solely on the qualification of educational personnel within that state. 2. To the extent that contracts made pursuant to this agreement deal with the educational requirements for the proper qualification of educational personnel, acceptance of a program of educational preparation shall be in accordance with such procedures and requirements as may be provided in the applicable contract. ARTICLE V Interstate Cooperation The party states agree that: 1. They will, so far as practicable, prefer the making of multilateral contracts pursuant to article III of this agreement. 2. They will facilitate and strengthen cooperation in interstate certification and other elements of educational personnel qualification and for this purpose shall cooperate with agencies, organizations, and associations interested in certification and other elements of educational personnel qualification. ARTICLE VI Agreement Evaluation The designated state officials of any party states may meet from time to time as a group to evaluate progress under the agreement, and to formulate recommendations for changes. ARTICLE VII Other Arrangements Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to prevent or inhibit other arrangements or practices of any party state or states to facilitate the interchange of educational personnel. ARTICLE VIII Effect and Withdrawal 1. This agreement shall become effective when enacted into law by two (2) states. Thereafter it shall become effective as to any state upon its enactment of this agreement. 2. Any party state may withdraw from this agreement by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one (1) year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. 3. No withdrawal shall relieve the withdrawing state of any obligation imposed upon it by a contract to which it is a party. The duration of contracts and the methods and conditions of withdrawal therefrom shall be specified in their terms. ARTICLE IX Construction and Severability This agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States, or the application thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p6">The general assembly recognizes that administrators are not members of teacher collective bargaining units and, therefore, are not protected by the terms of teacher bargaining agreements. While clearly intending neither to interfere with the discretion of school committees to choose those who shall administer local schools nor to grant tenure to school administrators, the general assembly deems it necessary to the orderly and effective functioning of public education to inform school administrators of the bases or reasons for their suspension, dismissal, or nonrenewal of their employment relationship, and to afford administrators an opportunity to be heard before the school committee. Full disclosure of the bases or reasons for suspension, dismissal, or nonrenewal and the hearing which may follow, while providing administrators and school committees a meaningful hedge against mistaken or impermissible actions as well as an opportunity to question and confront those individuals whose judgment or allegations furnish the basis for the actions taken, are ultimately intended to erase harmful innuendo from any suspension, dismissal, or nonrenewal of an administrator.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Good and Just Cause.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the only reason given for dismissal of tenured teachers was that as purported long-term substitutes, they were being replaced by more senior teachers, the teachers were wrongly terminated under Rhode Island law.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The failure to offer any hearing within the year prior to the bringing of suit, coupled with the failure to give notice of any reason sufficient for discharge of a tenured teacher, amounted to a failure to provide notice and hearing at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.

<p class="p7"><b>Probationary Period.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In order that a school committee may make an informed decision on whether to offer a teacher permanent employment, the legislature has required that a teacher perform satisfactorily for a probationary period prior to becoming eligible for tenure.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although Rhode Island law does not provide a definitive answer to the question whether dismissed teacher could have raised her constitutional claims before the administrative bodies themselves, clearly she could have raised them before the Rhode Island courts upon review of the administrative actions and such claims could have been considered on the merits.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because superintendent of schools was not a party to prior state proceedings under this section, and because he was not a privy of any of the other parties, res judicata could not operate as a bar to subsequent federal action against him under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and the superintendent’s status as a nonparty to the previous action also means that plaintiff could not utilize collateral estoppel in the federal action to preclude relitigation of facts resolved in her favor in the previous proceedings.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Section 16-13-4 shall not prevent the suspension of a teacher for good and just cause. Prior to the suspension of a teacher as provided in this section, the school committee shall hold a pre-suspension hearing to determine if a suspension is warranted, and at the pre-suspension hearing, shall consider any available evidence and afford the teacher or his or her counsel an opportunity to respond to that evidence. In the event a teacher is suspended or otherwise not permitted to perform his or her duties prior to the presuspension hearing, then the teacher shall be paid his or her regular salary during that period.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Whenever a teacher is suspended by a school committee, the school committee shall furnish the teacher with a complete statement of the cause(s) of the suspension and, upon request, shall afford the teacher a hearing and appeal pursuant to the procedure set forth in § 16-13-4. If the teacher shall be vindicated as a result of the hearing or any appeal the teacher shall be paid in full for the period of suspension, and provided further, that during the period of suspension, all medical and insurance benefits shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit or at any time to have prohibited a school committee in a municipality or regional school district with an elected school committee, or the chief executive officer in a municipality with an appointed school committee, from agreeing, in a collective bargaining agreement, to the arbitration of disputes arising out of the suspension of a teacher pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Cause for Suspension.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a teacher is suspended by a school committee they are obligated to advise the teacher of the cause of the suspension and thus afford him an opportunity to request a hearing. Royal v. Barry, 91 R.I. 24, 160 A.2d 572, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 54 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A school committee exceeds its jurisdiction when it suspends a teacher without giving a reason for its action and such action may be corrected by certiorari. Royal v. Barry, 91 R.I. 24, 160 A.2d 572, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 54 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where teachers refused to answer questions put to them by school committee and school committee then announced that such teachers were suspended for refusal to answer questions, the reason for such suspension was given and the sufficiency of such grounds could only be determined at a hearing before the committee and an appeal to the commissioner of education under § 16-39-2. Bray v. Bray, 91 R.I. 34, 160 A.2d 577, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 55 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction and Interpretation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any reliance on the provision of R.I. Gen. Laws § 16-13-5(a) for the proposition that a teacher could be “suspended” with pay was misplaced as such an interpretation ignored the prohibition against suspending a teacher without first conducting a pre-suspension hearing; the payment provision merely ensured a teacher’s right to continue to collect pay before he or she was in fact suspended, it did not help define the term “suspension”. Martone v. Johnston Sch. Comm., 824 A.2d 426, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 158 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Hearing on Suspension.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A hearing is not required before suspension and if following suspension, none is requested, none is required, but if on request a hearing is had an appeal from an adverse decision by the committee is to the commissioner of education under § 16-39-2, and not by certiorari to the court. Royal v. Barry, 91 R.I. 24, 160 A.2d 572, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 54 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a teacher was placed on leave, with pay, for alleged sexual harassment, he was not “suspended” for purposes of R.I. Gen. Laws § 16-13-5; therefore, he was not entitled to a pre-suspension hearing, under § 16-13-5. Martone v. Johnston Sch. Comm., 824 A.2d 426, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 158 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the better practice might be to provide tenured teachers with notice of the reasons why he or she was being placed on administrative leave, R.I. Gen. Laws § 16-13-5 did not require it. Martone v. Johnston Sch. Comm., 824 A.2d 426, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 158 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a teacher was suspended with pay for alleged sexual harassment, and he pursued a grievance under his collective bargaining agreement with the school, under the election of remedies doctrine, he could not seek a writ of mandamus in the superior court to compel the committee to grant him a hearing under R.I. Gen. Laws § 16-13-5 before the conclusion of his grievance procedure, and he had no clear legal right to a hearing under § 16-13-5. Martone v. Johnston Sch. Comm., 824 A.2d 426, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 158 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Powers of School Committee.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>School committees have wider latitude when acting to suspend than when the question is one of dismissal. Royal v. Barry, 91 R.I. 24, 160 A.2d 572, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 54 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Unlawful Dismissal.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While a teacher who had been unlawfully suspended had lost emoluments restored by this section, there was no specific provision by the legislature to restore lost emoluments to a teacher who had been unlawfully dismissed and such teacher was not precluded from showing any circumstances that would warrant injunctive relief pending final outcome of his appeal.

<p class="p6">The state pension systems for teachers of public education have proved to be inadequate to meet the special needs of retirement during this period of sharply increasing costs of living. A completely adequate retirement system for teachers is an essential responsibility of the state in providing sound public education. Therefore, §§ 16-15-13 to 16-15-15 are designed to provide additional state aid for retired teachers in order to make the teaching profession more attractive to qualified teachers and to provide for the security and welfare of education in the state.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Prior to July 1, 2012, each teacher shall contribute into the system nine and one-half percent (9.5%) of compensation as his or her share of the cost of annuities, benefits, and allowances. Effective July 1, 2012, each teacher shall contribute an amount equal to three and three quarters percent (3.75%) of his or her compensation. Effective July 1, 2015, each teacher with twenty (20) or more years of total service as of June 30, 2012, shall contribute an amount equal to eleven percent (11%) of his or her compensation. The employer contribution on behalf of teacher members of the system shall be in an amount that will pay a rate percent of the compensation paid to the members, according to the method of financing prescribed in the state retirement act in chapters 8 — 10 and 10.3 of title 36. This amount shall be paid forty percent (40%) by the state and sixty percent (60%) by the city, town, local educational agency, or any formalized commissioner-approved cooperative service arrangement by whom the teacher members are employed, with the exception of teachers who work in federally funded projects and further with the exception of any supplemental contributions by a local municipality employer under chapter 10.3 of title 36 which supplemental employer contributions shall be made wholly by the local municipality. Provided, however, that the rate percent paid shall be rounded to the nearest hundredth of one percent (.01%).</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> In case of the failure of any city, town, or local educational agency, or any formalized commissioner-approved cooperative service arrangement, to pay to the state retirement system the amounts due from it under this section within the time prescribed, the general treasurer is authorized to deduct the amount from any money due the city, town, or local educational agency from the state.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The employer’s contribution shared by the state shall be paid in the amounts prescribed in this section for the city, town, or local educational agency and under the same payment schedule. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the city, town, or local educational agency or any formalized commissioner-approved cooperative service arrangement shall remit to the general treasurer of the state the local employer’s share of the teacher’s retirement on the date contributions are withheld but no later than three (3) business days following the pay period ending in which contributions were withheld. The amounts that would have been contributed shall be deposited by the state in a special fund and not used for any purpose. The general treasurer, upon receipt of the local employer’s share, shall effect transfer of a matching amount of money from the state funds appropriated for this purpose by the general assembly into the retirement fund.</p>
<p class="p6">Upon reconciliation of the final amount owed to the retirement fund for the employer share, the state shall ensure that any local education aid reduction assumed for the FY 2010 revised budget in excess of the actual savings is restored to the respective local entities.</p>

<p class="p6">For the purposes of this chapter a private school or at-home instruction shall be approved only when it complies with the following requirements: (1) that the period of attendance of the pupils in the school or in the home instruction is substantially equal to that required by law in public schools; (2) that registers are kept and returned to the school committee, the superintendent of schools, truant officers, and the department of elementary and secondary education in relation to the attendance of pupils, and are made the same as registers kept by the public schools; (3) that reading, writing, geography, arithmetic, the history of the United States, the history of Rhode Island, and the principles of American government shall be taught in the English language substantially to the same extent as these subjects are required to be taught in the public schools, and that the teaching of the English language and of other subjects indicated in this section shall be thorough and efficient; provided, however, that nothing contained in this section shall be construed or operate to deny the right to teach in private schools or in at-home instruction any of the subjects or any other subject in any other language in addition to the teaching in English as prescribed in this section; provided, further, that any interested person resident in any city or town aggrieved by the action of the school committee of the city or town either in approving or refusing to approve at-home instruction may appeal the action to the department of elementary and secondary education. The department of elementary and secondary education, after notice to the parties interested of the time and place of a hearing, shall examine and decide the appeal without cost to the parties. The commissioner of elementary and secondary education shall also grant a hearing to any party aggrieved by a refusal to approve a private school pursuant to § 16-60-6(10).

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The school committee of any town or city using a pupil transportation vehicle as defined in § 31-22.1-1 shall comply with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, notwithstanding the provisions of § 31-22.1-3(6).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> For transportation provided to children enrolled in grades kindergarten through five (5), school bus monitors, other than the school bus driver, shall be required on all school-bound and home-bound routes. Variances to the requirement for a school bus monitor may be granted by the commissioner of elementary and secondary education if he or she finds that an alternative plan provides substantially equivalent safety for children. For the purposes of this section a “school bus monitor” means any person sixteen (16) years of age or older.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> No school committee shall negotiate, extend, or renew any transportation contract unless such contract enables the district to participate in the statewide transportation system, without penalty to the district, upon implementation of the statewide transportation system described in §§ 16-21.1-7 [repealed] and 16-21.1-8. Notice of the implementation of the statewide transportation system for in-district transportation shall be provided in writing by the department of elementary and secondary education to the superintendent of each district upon implementation. Upon implementation of the statewide system of transportation for all students, each school committee shall purchase transportation services for its own resident students by accessing the statewide system on a fee-for-service basis for each student; provided, however, that any school committee that fulfills its transportation obligations primarily through the use of district-owned buses or district employees may continue to do so. Variances to the requirement for the purchase of transportation services through the statewide transportation system for non-public and non-shared routes may be granted by the commissioner of elementary and secondary education if the commissioner finds that an alternative system is more cost effective. All fees paid for transportation services provided to students under the statewide system shall be paid into a statewide student transportation services restricted receipt account within the department of elementary and secondary education. Payments from the account shall be limited to payments to the transportation service provider and transportation system consultants. This restricted receipt account shall not be subject to the indirect cost recoveries provisions set forth in § 35-4-27.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> No school committee shall negotiate, extend, or renew any school transportation service contract unless the contract provides for payments to school bus drivers, attendants, monitors, and aides for one hundred and eighty (180) days or the length of the contracted-for school year, whichever is longer.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> With respect to any contract entered into under this section, a school committee or local education agency shall give a preference in contract and/or subcontract awards to the public transportation provider that uses electric buses to the greatest extent. This preference shall be given equal weight to any other preferences available to vendors.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> With respect to any contract entered into under this section, no school committee or local education agency (“LEA”) shall take any adverse disciplinary action against any school bus driver, attendant, monitor, or aide covered by a collective bargaining agreement prior to any investigation or action taken by the contracting entity as provided for in the collective bargaining agreement. Nor shall the school committee or LEA impose discipline in excess of what is provided for in the governing collective bargaining agreement.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Approximately one in five hundred (500) school children have diabetes. Individuals with diabetes need to manage their diabetes carefully to keep their blood glucose levels within target range.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> High blood glucose levels contribute to medical complications, such as blindness, kidney failure, amputations and cardiovascular disease, while severely low blood glucose levels can lead to unconsciousness or seizures with a potential for brain damage or death.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> While episodes of unconsciousness or seizures are uncommon, schools should be prepared to promptly respond to such emergencies due to the urgency of the situation, and the inability of the student to drink or ingest food that might restore their blood sugar level.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Across the country, schools are increasingly more prepared and trained for medical emergencies using defibrillators and giving injections to counter allergic reactions.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The American academy of pediatrics September 2003 policy guidelines on administration of medication in school states: “Some medications, such as epinephrine injections for severe allergic reactions or glucagons for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), have few significant adverse effects. Because these episodes, by nature, occur at unpredictable times when a school nurse may not be available, trained designated school staffs should be available.”</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The Rhode Island chapter of the American academy of pediatrics states (November 20, 2005) that: “While quite rare, such episodes (of hypoglycemic unconsciousness or seizure) run the risk of serious long-term complications, and potentially death, if there is a delay in appropriate treatment.”</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Notwithstanding the regional structure created in this chapter, and upon implementation of a statewide school transportation system for all students, each school committee shall purchase the transportation services for their own resident students by accessing this integrated statewide system of transportation on a fee-for-service basis for each child; provided, however, that any school committee that fulfills its transportation obligations predominantly through the use of district-owned buses or district employees may apply for a variance from the commissioner of education, or the commissioner’s designee, thereby requesting that its transportation obligations continue to be achieved through the use of the buses owned by the district and staffed by district employees. All fees paid for transportation services provided to students under the statewide system shall be paid into a statewide student transportation services restricted receipt account within the department of elementary and secondary education. Payments from the account shall be limited to payments to the transportation service provider and transportation system consultants. This restricted receipt account shall not be subject to the indirect cost recoveries provisions set forth in § 35-4-27. The goals of the statewide system of transportation for all students shall be the reduction of duplication of cost and routes in transporting children from the various cities and towns using different buses within and between each city and town, the improvement of services to children through the development of shorter ride times and more efficient routes of travel, and the reduction of cost to local school committees through achieving efficiency in eliminating the need for each school district to contract for and provide these transportation services separately.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> There shall be deducted from the final aid payment to each school district any amounts owed to the state at the end of the fiscal year for transportation of the district’s students under the statewide transportation system established pursuant to this section. Districts shall receive monthly invoices summarizing the basis of the transportation fees charged. Any such deductions in aid shall be transferred to the statewide student transportation services restricted receipt account, as set forth in § 35-4-27.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> No school committee shall negotiate, extend, or renew any public transportation service contract unless the contract provides for payments to school bus drivers, attendants, monitors, and aides for one hundred and eighty (180) days or the length of the contracted-for school year, whichever is longer.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> With respect to any contract entered into under this section, a school committee or local education agency shall give a preference in contract and/or subcontract awards to the public transportation provider that uses electric buses to the greatest extent. This preference shall be given equal weight to any other preferences available to vendors.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> With respect to any contract entered into under this section, no school committee or local education agency (“LEA”) shall take any adverse disciplinary action against any school bus driver, attendant, monitor, or aide covered by a collective bargaining agreement prior to any investigation or action taken by the contracting entity as provided for in the collective bargaining agreement. Nor shall the school committee or LEA impose discipline in excess of what is provided for in the governing collective bargaining agreement.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The number and type of virtual learning programs and courses have increased considerably, and the prevalence of virtual learning continues to grow. Virtual learning utilizes the power and scalability of technology to remove the constraints of traditional classroom learning, which can allow Rhode Island’s students to access personalized learning at any time, in any place, and in ways that complement and extend traditional school settings.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> Public schools, school districts, and postsecondary institutions in Rhode Island should have the freedom to work with teachers, families, and students to create customizable learning opportunities that incorporate technology and reflect effective practices.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> The freedom that comes from technologically-supported opportunities to learn must be accompanied by a clear responsibility to ensure that such opportunities are of high quality, consistent with state standards for teaching and instruction, fulfill high school graduation requirements, reflect the principles of equity and access, and include accountability provisions that assure citizens that any investment of public tax dollars is well spent.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> Rhode Island is one of a few states that has not established the kind of statewide policies on virtual education that will create the optimal conditions for effective learning and instruction.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> It is the intent of the legislature to promote linguistic proficiency and cultural literacy in one or more languages, in addition to English, and to provide recognition of the attainment of those needed and important skills through the establishment of the state seal of biliteracy.

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Notwithstanding any other federal or state law or regulation, the school committee where a parentally placed child who has, or develops, a disability in private school resides, shall provide the child with the same free and appropriate education as it provides to children in public schools. These children shall have the same rights and remedies in the regulations of the board of education governing the education of children with disabilities as children in public school relative to initially determining eligibility, implementation, and/or any other rights and remedies relative to any special education services the child may be eligible to receive from the public school district.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> For the purpose of this statute, a parentally placed child who has, or develops, a disability in private school is defined as a child enrolled or placed in a private school by the unilateral decision of his or her parents and without consolation of the public school district, who either has, or at some point while at the private school is diagnosed with, a learning disability. Parents who unilaterally enroll their child in a private school are required to pay the tuition costs related to the child’s education that are unrelated to the child’s disability, and the public school district where the child resides is responsible for payment of the services related to the child’s disability as developed and determined in the child’s individual education plan.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> For the purpose of this statute, a free and appropriate education is defined as special education services and related services that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Are provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and without charge;</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> In those cases that an individual education plan has been adopted for a child and the child moves to another town or city, the plan shall remain in effect until a new plan is adopted for the child in the new town or city.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> A child with a disability as referenced in subsection (a) of this section shall have available to them any benefits provided by this section up to their twenty-first birthday, in accordance with the student’s individualized education program (IEP). Provided, in the event such a child with a disability is enrolled in a postsecondary or transitional educational program as part of the services provided to the child by the school committee or local education agency (LEA), and such child reaches twenty-one (21) years of age during a school or program year, then the school committee’s or LEA’s obligation to pay for the postsecondary or transitional program shall continue through to the conclusion of the school or program’s academic year, in accordance with the student’s individualized education program. Not later than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the child turning twenty-one (21) years of age, the local educational agency (LEA) shall provide the child and the parent or guardian with notice explaining the rights under this section that remain in effect at age twenty-one (21). Further, not later than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the child turning twenty-one (21) years of age, the state adult service agencies responsible for planning, funding and providing services and supports for adults with developmental disabilities, including the state office of rehabilitation services (ORS) and the state department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals (BHDDH), shall provide the child and the parent or guardian with notice of the obligations and responsibilities that the respective agency owes to eligible recipients along with a level of funding and/or an individual support plan for the child twenty-one (21) years of age to receive.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A reevaluation of a handicapped child does not, under either federal or state law, require parental consent nor falter in the face of parental nonacquiescence.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An individual does not have a constitutional right to a hearing merely because, or whenever, he or she would like to have one. Where the plaintiff does not contest the fundamental fairness of the reevaluation process itself, the court only need focus on whether or not she, as the handicapped child’s parent and guardian, will have an opportunity to be fairly heard prior to any change in the child’s placement. In cases arising under the act, the parent is afforded such an opportunity; and the provision of a hearing after the reevaluation (but prior to any change in status) fully meets applicable due process requirements.

The cost of special education, including evaluation, support services, and training, including the cost of special education personnel, materials and equipment, tuition, transportation, rent, and contractual services, of the children in the program continuum placements provided under § 16-24-2 shall be paid by the state to the city or town at the same times provided in § 16-7-17 based on the financial and census data for the second school year preceding; provided, however, that the amount of the payment for special education pupils in each of the particular program placements shall not exceed one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the state median for special education pupils in that same placement. In determining the applicable state median expenditure for special education pupils for the purpose of this section, the board of regents shall under § 16-24-2 differentiate between types of program continuum placements on the basis of the amount of time a child requires special programs outside of the regular classroom to meet his or her particular needs, the ratio of personnel to pupils required for the programs, and the efficiency and economy of operating the programs. The board of regents may distribute the payments through the cooperative service arrangements provided for under chapter 3.1 of this title. The payments shall be made only after approval and certification by the board of regents that the payments are made pursuant to this section, that cost of special education has been determined and reported in accordance with the standard accounting and reporting procedures provided for in subdivision (3) of § 16-24-2, and that the program placements have met the regulations and requirements prescribed by the board of regents. The auditor general shall audit these payments and report, in writing, any exceptions to the board of regents and to the joint committee on legislative services.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The commissioner of elementary and secondary education shall make a continuous evaluation of the operation of this section and at least once every three (3) years the board of regents for elementary and secondary education shall review the findings of the commissioner and shall make its recommendations in writing to the governor and to the general assembly.</p>

For each fiscal year commencing 1992-1993, the total appropriation for this purpose shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the approved special education excess expenditures. All entitlements except those in § 16-24-6.2 shall be ratably reduced if less than one hundred percent (100%) of the expenditures appropriated. The state controller is authorized and directed to draw his or her orders upon the general treasurer for the payment of the sum or so much of it as may be required from time to time upon receipt by the controller of properly authenticated vouchers.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> This chapter contemplates that expenses for special education for children with disabilities will be determined in accordance with standard accounting and reporting procedures required pursuant to § 16-24-2(3), and will be separable from expenses with respect to which state financial support is provided in § 16-7-20; the same expenses may not be counted twice, that is, once for the purpose of § 16-7-20 and again for the purpose of this chapter.

The state of Rhode Island must take the lead in combating the increasingly rapid problems associated with “ASD” and the current treatments and strategies.

It is the further intent of the general assembly, subject to appropriation and/or the receipt of other resources designated for these purposes, to authorize the Rhode Island department of health to provide appropriate testing and screening models to determine a proper diagnosis of “ASD” and to create a case management system to properly catalogue such diagnosis. In addition, subject to appropriation and/or the receipt of other resources designated for these purposes, this chapter shall authorize programs of outreach, education, increased awareness and cultural competence to the statewide community.</p>

<p class="p6">The Rhode Island higher education assistance authority, on behalf of the state, is authorized and directed to execute a compact, substantially in the following form, with any one or more of the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont:</p>
<p class="p6"><b>NEW ENGLAND HIGHER EDUCATION COMPACT</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE I</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The purpose of the New England higher education compact shall be to provide greater educational opportunities and services through the establishment and maintenance of a coordinated educational program for the persons residing in the several states of New England parties to this compact with the aim of furthering higher education in the fields of medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, public health and in professional, technical, scientific, literary and other fields.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE II</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">There is hereby created and established a New England board of higher education hereinafter known as the board which shall be an agency of each state party to the compact. The board shall be a body corporate and politic, having the powers, duties and jurisdiction herein enumerated and such other and additional powers as shall be conferred upon it by the concurrent act or acts of the compacting states. The board shall consist of eight (8) resident members from each compacting state, chosen in the manner and for the terms provided by law of the several states parties to this compact, provided, however, that at least four (4) members shall be members of the legislature.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE III</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">This compact shall become operative immediately as to those states executing it whenever any two (2) or more of the states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut have executed it in the form which is in accordance with the laws of the respective compacting states.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE IV</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The board shall annually elect from its members a chairperson and vice-chairperson and shall appoint and at its pleasure remove or discharge said officers. It may appoint and employ an executive secretary and may employ such stenographic, clerical, technical or legal personnel as shall be necessary, and at its pleasure remove or discharge such personnel. It shall adopt a seal and suitable bylaws and shall promulgate any all rules and regulations which may be necessary for the conduct of its business. It may maintain an office or offices within the territory of the compacting states and may meet at any time or place. Meetings shall be held at least twice each year.</p>
<p class="p6">A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but no action of the board imposing any obligation on any compacting state shall be binding unless a majority of the members from such compacting state shall have voted in favor thereof. Where meetings are planned to discuss matters relevant to problems of education affecting only certain of the compacting states, the board may vote to authorize special meetings of the board members of such states. The board shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements and shall make an annual report to the governor and the legislature of each compacting state setting forth in detail the operations and transactions conducted by it pursuant to this compact, and shall make recommendations for any legislative action deemed by it advisable, including amendments to the statutes of the compacting states which may be necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of this compact. The board shall not pledge the credit of any compacting state without consent of the legislature thereof given pursuant to the constitutional processes of said state. The board may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under article VII of this compact, provided that the board takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to the incurring of any obligation to be met in whole or in part in this manner. Except where the board makes use of funds available to it under article VII hereof, the board shall not incur any obligations for salaries, office, administrative, traveling or other expenses prior to the allotment of funds by the compacting states adequate to meet the same. Each compacting state reserves the right to provide hereafter by law for the examination and audit of the accounts of the board. The board shall appoint a treasurer and assistant treasurer who may be empowered to perform any and all duties of the treasurer. Fiscal disbursements of the board shall be valid only when authorized by any two (2) persons from among those authorized by the board to execute this authority, and when substantiated by vouchers signed and countersigned by any two (2) persons from among those the board has authorized to execute this authority. The executive secretary shall be custodian of the records of the board with authority to attest to and certify the records or copies thereof.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE V</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The board shall have the power to: (1) Collect, correlate, and evaluate data in the fields of its interest under this compact; to publish reports, bulletins, and other documents making available the results of its research; and, in its discretion, to charge fees for said reports, bulletins, and documents; (2) enter into such contractual agreements or arrangements with any of the compacting states or agencies thereof and with educational institutions and agencies as may be required in the judgment of the board to provide adequate services and facilities in educational fields covered by this compact; provided that it shall be the policy of the board in the negotiation of its agreements to serve increased numbers of students from the compacting states through arrangements with them existing institutions, whenever in the judgment of the board adequate service can be so secured in the New England region. Each of the compacting states shall contribute funds to carry out the contracts of the board on the basis of the number of students from such state for whom the board may contract. Contributions shall be at the rate determined by the board in each educational field. Except in those instances where the board by specific action allocates funds available to it under article VII hereof, it shall be the policy of the board to enter into such contracts only upon appropriation of funds by the compacting states. Any contract entered into shall be in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the board and in accordance with the laws of the compacting states.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE VI</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Each state agrees that, when authorized by the legislature pursuant to the constitutional processes, it will from time to time make available to the board such funds as may be required for the expenses of the board as authorized under the terms of this compact. The contribution of each state for this purpose shall be in the proportion that its population bears to the total combined population of the states who are parties hereto as shown from time to time by the most recent official published report of the bureau of the census of the United States of America; unless the board shall adopt another basis in making its recommendation for appropriation to the compacting states.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE VII</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The board for the purposes of this compact is hereby empowered to receive grants, devises, gifts and bequests which the board may agree to accept and administer. The board shall administer property held in accordance with special trusts, grants and bequests and shall also administer grants and devises of land and gifts or bequests of personal property made to the board for special uses and shall execute said trusts, investing the proceeds thereof in notes or bonds secured by sufficient mortgages or other securities.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE VIII</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any compacting state or of the United States the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby; provided, that if this compact is held to be contrary to the constitution of any compacting state the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to all other compacting states.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE IX</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a compacting state until the legislature or the governor of such state, as the laws of such state shall provide, takes action to withdraw therefrom. Such action shall not be effective until two (2) years after notice thereof has been sent by the governor of the state desiring to withdraw to the governors of all other states then parties to the compact. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations accruing hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Any state so withdrawing, unless reinstated, shall cease to have any claim to or ownership of any of the property held by or vested in the board or to any of the funds of the board held under the terms of the compact. Thereafter, the withdrawing state may be reinstated by application after appropriate legislation is enacted by such state, upon approval by a majority vote of the board.</p>

The employer will maintain on file, subject to inspection by the commissioner, evidence that the criminal records checks have been initiated on all employees seeking employment after August 1, 1985, and the results of the checks. Failure to maintain that evidence on file will be prima facie grounds to revoke the license or registration of the operator of the facility. It will be the responsibility of the Rhode Island bureau of criminal identification to conduct the nationwide criminal records check pursuant to this section. The nationwide criminal records check will be provided to the applicant for employment without charge to the applicant and without charge to the prospective employer if the employer is a tax exempt corporation or an unincorporated nonprofit organization qualified under § 501(c) of the United States Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 501(c).</p>

The bond may be continuous and shall be conditioned to provide indemnification to any student suffering loss as a result of any fraud or misrepresentation used in procuring his or her enrollment, and may be supplied by the agent of a privately owned school and by the school itself as a blanket bond covering each of its agents and the school in the amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000). A permit shall be valid for one year from the date on which it was issued. The liability of the surety on the bond for each representative covered by it shall in no event exceed the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000) as an aggregate for any and all students for all breaches of the conditions of the bond by the representatives. The surety of any bond may cancel the bond upon giving thirty (30) days’ notice in writing to the department of elementary and secondary education and after this shall be relieved of liability for any breach of condition occurring after the effective date of the cancellation. An application for renewal shall be accompanied by a fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) and a surety bond, as provided in this subsection, if a continuous bond has not been furnished. All fees collected for the issuance or renewal of the permits shall be deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the general fund.</p>

<p class="p6">The Rhode Island Constitution recognizes the diffusion of knowledge as essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of all the people and places the responsibility on the general assembly to promote public schools and to adopt all means deemed necessary and proper to secure to the people the advantages and opportunities of education. As this responsibility relates to limited English proficient students, the state asserts that these students shall be provided with appropriate programs and services which will make their educational opportunities equal to their English dominant peers. Programs or services developed by local schools must, at the very least, provide for the attainment of English language proficiency and academic achievement.</p>

<p class="p6">The purpose of this chapter is to authorize a system of financial assistance, consisting of loan guaranties, savings programs, and other aids, for qualified students, parents, and others responsible for paying the costs of education to enable them to obtain an education beyond the high school level by attending public or private educational institutions. The general assembly has found and declares that it is in the public interest and essential to the welfare and well being of the inhabitants of the state and to the proper growth and development of the state to foster and provide financial assistance to qualified students, parents, and others responsible for paying the costs of education in order to help prospective students to obtain an education beyond the high school level. The general assembly has found that many inhabitants of the state who are fully qualified to enroll in appropriate educational institutions for furthering their education beyond the high school level lack the financial means and are unable, without financial assistance as authorized under this chapter, to pay the cost of their education, with a consequent irreparable loss to the state of valuable talents vital to its welfare. The general assembly also recognizes that educational institutions for higher education are in need of appropriate additional means to provide financial assistance to qualified students, parents, and others responsible for paying the costs of education. The general assembly has determined that the establishment of a proper system of financial assistance, containing eligibility opportunities for students and residents of this state and other states serves a public purpose and is fully consistent with the long established policy of the state to encourage, promote, and assist the education of the people of the state. The general assembly further finds that higher education financial assistance needs of Rhode Islanders will be better served by transferring all of the functions and programs of the Rhode Island higher education assistance authority to the Rhode Island division of higher education assistance and the office of the general treasurer.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 16-59-1 and this section give the board of governors for higher education broad powers to operate the University of Rhode Island. Vanlaarhoven v. Newman, 564 F. Supp. 145, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17586 (D.R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Residency Status.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The University of Rhode Island’s regulations mean that a nonresident student may acquire residency status if, after becoming emancipated as defined by the regulations, he or she establishes a bona fide residence in Rhode Island for at least one year. If the raison d’etre for a student’s presence in Rhode Island is attendance at URI, however, the student will bear a heavy burden in overcoming presumptive nonresidency status. Where a student plaintiff has introduced no evidence indicating that the regulations were applied to him in a vagarious, whimsical, uneven, or capricious manner, given that the regulations were a valid exercise of the authority of the Board of Governors for higher education, the plaintiff’s claim under the federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, based on the defendants’ determination of his nonresidency must fall. Vanlaarhoven v. Newman, 564 F. Supp. 145, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17586 (D.R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sovereign Immunity.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The University of Rhode Island is not an alter ego of the state for eleventh amendment purposes. While URI performs a “traditional governmental function” in providing a college education to Rhode Islanders at relatively modest cost, the statutory scheme graphically illustrates the General Assembly’s design that the board of governors for higher education and URI function independently of state government. Vanlaarhoven v. Newman, 564 F. Supp. 145, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17586 (D.R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even if the University of Rhode Island were considered an arm of the state, the state has waived eleventh amendment immunity for the board of governors for higher education and the University of Rhode Island through the statutory provision giving the board the right “to sue and be sued in its own name” in § 16-59-1.

<p class="p7"><b>Actions Against State University.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The University of Rhode Island is not an alter ego of the state for eleventh amendment purposes. While URI performs a “traditional governmental function” in providing a college education to Rhode Islanders at relatively modest cost, the statutory scheme graphically illustrates the General Assembly’s design that the board of governors for higher education and URI function independently of state government. The board has the power to sue and be sued in its own name, to control and dispose of property, and to manage its own budget. Most significant for eleventh amendment purposes, it has exclusive control over the emoluments which it receives from sources other than the public coffers. Such funds, in the form of tuition payments, endowments, gifts, and the like, are not commingled with state funds and may be drawn upon only by the board. This provision gives the board — and URI — a not inconsiderable amount of economic and operational autarchy. Moreover, it signals that any judgments against URI need not be paid out of state funds, nor be subjected to scrutiny by the General Assembly prior to satisfaction thereof. Any award of damages would not, therefore, require tampering with the state budget, nor would such an award directly interdict the state’s fiscal autonomy. Vanlaarhoven v. Newman, 564 F.

<p class="p6">The purpose of this chapter is to authorize a system of financial assistance, consisting of grants, loans, and other aids, for qualified inhabitants of the state to enable them to obtain a postsecondary education by attending public or private educational institutions both within and without the state. The general assembly has found and declares that it is in the public interest and essential to the welfare and well being of the inhabitants of the state and to the proper growth and development of the state to foster and provide financial assistance to inhabitants of the state, properly qualified for it, in order to help them to obtain a postsecondary education. The general assembly has found that many inhabitants of the state who are fully qualified to enroll in appropriate educational institutions for furthering their education beyond the high school level lack the financial means and are unable, without financial assistance as authorized under this chapter, to pay the cost of that education, with a consequent irreparable loss to the state of valuable talents vital to its welfare. The general assembly has determined that the establishment of a proper system of financial assistance for that objective purpose serves a public purpose and is fully consistent with the long established policy of the state to encourage, promote and assist the education of the people of the state.</p>

The bonds and notes may be executed and delivered by the authority at any time; may be in any form and denominations and of any tenor and maturities; and may be in bearer form or in registered form, as to principal and interest or as to principal alone, all as the authority may determine.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Bonds may be payable in any installments, and at any times not exceeding forty (40) years from their date, as shall be determined by the authority.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Notes, and any renewals of notes, may be payable in any installments and at any times not exceeding ten (10) years from the date of the original issue of the notes, as shall be determined by the authority.</p>

These escrowed proceeds may be invested, and reinvested, in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States, or in certificates of deposit or time deposits or repurchase agreements, fully secured or guaranteed by the state or the United States, or an instrumentality of either, maturing at any time or times as shall be appropriate to assure the prompt payment, as to principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, of the outstanding bonds or notes to be refunded. The interest, income, and profits, if any, earned or realized on this investment, may also be applied to the payment of the outstanding bonds or notes to be refunded. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied and carried out, any balance of the proceeds and interest, income, and profits, if any, earned or realized on the investments of these, may be returned to the authority for use by it in furtherance of its purposes.

<p class="p6"><b>(o)</b> If a director or officer of the authority whose signature appears on the bonds, notes, or coupons shall cease to be a director or officer before the delivery of those bonds or notes, that signature shall be valid and sufficient for all purposes, as if the director or officer had remained in office until the delivery.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(p)</b> The authority shall also have the power out of any funds available to purchase bonds and notes of the authority if the authority determines that such purchases will stabilize or make the market for the authority’s bonds more efficient. Such purchases shall not result in the extinguishment of the debt of the authority represented by such bonds or notes. At the discretion of the authority, such bonds and notes may be held until the purpose of the purchase has been effected and then sold to the market or used as a credit against future redemptions or maturities.</p>

<p class="p6">The purpose of this chapter is to provide an incentive, in the form of interest reduction on certain types of education loans, to students who desire to serve the health care needs of individuals in Rhode Island by enrolling in a registered nurse training program. The general assembly has found and hereby declares that it is in the public interest and essential to the welfare and well being of the inhabitants of the state that a sufficient number of registered nurses be attracted to Rhode Island to serve the health care needs of our population. The general assembly further finds that there is a growing shortage of qualified registered nurses to meet the needs of the state’s population. The general assembly determines that it is vital to the welfare of the state’s citizenry that an incentive be provided to attract and retain registered nurses in the state to meet their needs.</p>

For purposes of payment and reimbursement for educational costs under this chapter, the term “group home or other residential facility” shall not include independent-living programs. Each city and town that contains one or more group homes or other residential facilities that do not include delivery of educational services will receive funds as part of state aid to education in accordance with the following provisions:</p>

Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any law to the contrary, the education aid for all group home or other residential facility “beds” located or associated with the Children’s Residential and Family Treatment (CRAFT) program located on the East Providence campus of Bradley Hospital shall be twenty-two thousand dollars ($22,000) per bed.

<p class="p6">The state of Rhode Island is committed to equal education opportunity for all citizens. To ensure the fulfillment of this commitment, all persons must have the opportunity to acquire the skills of literacy: basic reading, writing, speaking, listening, and mathematics skills. The opportunity to acquire these skills must be provided in programs designed to meet the varying needs of students. Special attention must be given to prevent students from dropping out of school. Research indicates that large classes prevent teachers from meeting the learning requirements of pupils on an individualized basis, where smaller classes enable teachers to use more varied, innovative, and effective learning approaches. We can increase effectiveness of our schools by promoting smaller classes in kindergarten through third grade. A foundation in these skill areas provides students with the skills they need to complete their elementary and secondary studies, to graduate from high school, and to participate in, and to contribute to, our society as literate and productive adults.</p>

Reading instruction to improve the reading skills of all students in the early grades (specifically kindergarten (K) through to and including grade five (5)) shall be consistent with the council on elementary and secondary education’s reading policy.

It recognizes that private support in addition to state support is desirable in achieving this goal. It is the intent of the legislature to provide the opportunity to each public institution of higher education in Rhode Island to receive and match challenge grants for capital projects within the university, the college, and the community college. The associated foundations that serve these institutions shall solicit and receive gifts from private sources to provide for matching funds to the challenge grants for the establishment of capital projects.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The purpose of this chapter is to provide an alternative within the public education system by offering opportunities for entities identified in § 16-77-2.1 to establish and maintain a high performing public school program according to the terms of a charter. The key appeal of the charter school concept is its promise of increased accountability for student achievement in exchange for increased school autonomy.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Charter public schools are intended to be vanguards, laboratories, and an expression of the on-going and vital state interest in the improvement of education. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any law to the contrary, a charter school shall be deemed to be a public school acting under state law and subject to the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C. § 6101, et seq., title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, et seq., title IX of the educational amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq., § 794 of title 29, and part B of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1411, et seq. All students and prospective students of a charter school shall be deemed to be public school students, having all the same rights under federal and Rhode Island law as students and prospective students at a non-chartered public school. These charter public schools shall be vehicles for research and development in areas such as curriculum, pedagogy, administration, materials, facilities, governance, parent relations and involvement, social development, instructor’s and administrator’s responsibilities, working conditions, student performance and fiscal accountability. It is the intent of the general assembly to create within the public school system vehicles for innovative learning opportunities to be utilized and evaluated in pilot projects. The provisions of this chapter are to be interpreted liberally to support the purposes set forth in this chapter and to advance a renewed commitment by the state to the mission, goals, and diversity of public education.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> It is the intent of the general assembly to provide opportunities for teachers, parents, pupils, and community members to establish and maintain public schools that operate independently as a method to accomplish all of the following:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Improve pupil learning by creating schools with rigorous academic standards in all basic areas of instruction for high pupil performance;</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> Encourage parental and community involvement with public schools.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> No private or parochial schools shall be eligible for charter public school status, nor shall a charter public school be affiliated in any way with a sectarian school or religious institution. Any charter public school authorized by this chapter shall be nonsectarian and nonreligious in its programs, admissions policies, employment practices, and all other operations. The board of regents shall not approve a charter to a school whose overall operation or education program is managed by a for profit entity.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The commissioner is empowered to promulgate rules and regulations consistent with this chapter, in conformance with chapter 35 of title 42, for the creation and operation of charter public schools. These rules and regulations shall set forth the process for rescission of state approval of a charter public school, including appropriate protections to ensure the continued provision of education services to the students of the charter public school whose charter is rescinded.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> All charter public schools shall adhere to financial record keeping, reporting, auditing requirements, and procedures as required by the Rhode Island department of education and in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> No more than thirty-five (35) charters shall be granted. At least one-half (1/2) of the total number of charter public schools in the state shall be reserved for charter school applications which are designed to increase the educational opportunities for at-risk pupils.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Operating costs of a charter public school shall be the total of the per pupil payments for each student attending the charter public school. The per pupil payment for each student shall be determined based on the per pupil cost for the district of residence of each student. The state’s share of the per pupil amount for each student attending the charter public school shall be paid by the state directly to the charter public school and shall be the percent, or share ratio, previously calculated under chapter 7 of this title; provided, that in no case shall the ratio be less than thirty percent (30%), minus the five percent (5%) of per pupil cost designated for indirect cost support to the student’s school district as defined in subsection (b). The five percent (5%) indirect cost amount shall be deducted from the district per pupil cost before the state share is derived by applying the share ratio to the district per pupil cost. The local share of the per pupil amount for each student attending the charter public school shall be paid to the charter public school by the district of residence of the student and shall be the per pupil cost for the district of residence of the student minus the state share of that per pupil cost as designated in this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> In addition to all state aid to education paid to a local district pursuant to chapter 7.1 of this title, the state will pay an additional amount to the district for each student from this district who is attending a charter public school. The additional amount of state aid per pupil shall be five percent (5%) of the districts per pupil cost. The additional state aid shall be for the purpose of assisting local school districts to undertake the indirect costs borne by a district when its student attends a charter public school.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The state department of elementary and secondary education shall annually determine both the state and local share of each charter public school’s operating costs by deriving the respective shares associated with each student reported as a member of the charter public school as of June 30 of the reference year as defined in § 16-7-16(11) (or the enrollment as of October 1 of the current school year in the first year of operation of a charter school). All other data used in this determination shall be based upon the reference year as defined in § 16-7-16(11).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The state shall make payments of its share of operating costs to each charter public school on a quarterly basis in July, October, January, and April. The July and October payments will be based upon the reported student membership of the charter public school as of June 30 of the reference year as defined in § 16-7-16(11) (or the enrollment as of October 1 of the current school year in the first year of operation of a charter school). Charter public schools will report current student enrollment, including district of residence for school purposes of each student enrolled, and each district will report current total district operating expenses and total district enrollments (including district students enrolled in charter public schools) annually by October 1. If the October 1 data on a charter public school’s student enrollment show a ten percent (10%) or greater increase or decrease in students from the June membership count, the third and fourth quarter payments to the charter public school will be adjusted to reflect actual student enrollment in the charter public school.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Local district payments to charter public schools for each district’s students enrolled in the charter public school shall also be made quarterly as designated in subsection (d); the first local district payment shall be made by August 15 instead of July. Any local school district more than thirty (30) days in arrears on a quarterly payment for its student(s) enrolled in a charter public school shall have the amount of the arrearage deducted from state aid to that district and the withheld arrearage shall be paid by the state directly to the charter public school.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Local school districts with student(s) enrolled in a charter public school shall continue to report these students in the total census of district public school students and will receive state aid for all these students pursuant to the provisions of chapter 7.1 of this title.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> All entitlements except those provided for in § 16-24-6.2 shall be ratably reduced if less than one hundred percent (100%) of the expenditures is appropriated.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> For fiscal year 2007, the indirect aid paid to districts pursuant to this section shall equal the amount received in the fiscal year 2006 enacted budget by the 2005 general assembly.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> A copy of the proposed charter for a district charter school at an existing public school shall be provided to the collective bargaining agent for the teachers in the school district where the district charter school is to be located at the time that it is filed with the school committee of the district where the district charter school is to be located and the commissioner. The teachers through their collective bargaining agent shall be afforded the opportunity to present their analysis of and recommendations regarding the proposed charter to the school committee of the district where the district charter school is to be located and the board of regents prior to any determination by those entities. If the teachers’ union objects to the proposed charter or to any provision of it, it shall set forth the reasons for those objections in detail. These objections and recommendations shall be considered and responded to by the school committee of the district where the district charter school is to be located and the commissioner before making any recommendation to the board of regents, and by the board of regents prior to its determination.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The commissioner or the school committee of the district where the district charter school is to be located will each decide on whether or not to recommend the granting of the charter to the board of regents within ninety (90) days after the conclusion of the public comment period.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Twenty-eight percent (28%) of youths, ages sixteen (16) to twenty-four (24) in Rhode Island, especially disadvantaged students, students of diverse racial, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and students with disabilities, do not complete high school;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Unemployment among youths, ages sixteen (16) to nineteen (19) in Rhode Island averaged eighteen and six-tenths percent (18.6%) in 1994, an intolerably high percentage, and earnings of high school graduates have been declining in relationship to earnings of individuals with post-secondary degrees;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> The workplace in the United States and especially in Rhode Island is changing in response to heightened international competition and new technologies, and these forces, which are ultimately beneficial to the nation, are shrinking the demand for and undermining the earning power of unskilled labor;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> Rhode Island lacks a comprehensive and coherent system to help its youth acquire the knowledge, skills, abilities, and information about and access to the labor market necessary to make an effective transition from school to career-oriented work or to further education and training;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> Students in Rhode Island can achieve higher academic and occupational standards, and many learn better and retain more when the students learn in context rather than in the abstract;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> While many students in Rhode Island have part-time jobs, there is infrequent linkage between:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(i)</b> These jobs, and</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(8)</b> The work-based learning approach, which is modeled after the time-honored apprenticeship concept, integrates theoretical instruction with structured on-the-job training, and this approach, combined with school-based learning, can be very effective in engaging student interest, enhancing skill acquisition, developing positive work attitudes, and preparing youths for high skill, high wage careers;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(9)</b> Federal resources currently fund a series of categorical, work-related education and training programs, many of which serve disadvantaged youths, that are not administered as a coherent whole; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(10)</b> In 1990, approximately sixteen thousand seven hundred forty-one (16,741) individuals in Rhode Island, ages sixteen (16) through twenty-four (24), had not completed high school and were not currently enrolled in school, a population representing approximately twenty-eight percent (28%) of all individuals in this age group which indicates that these young persons are particularly unprepared for the demands of the twenty-first century.</p>

<p class="p6">It is hereby found and declared as follows:</p>
<p class="p6">The importance of education and the need to educate our children to ensure the future of our state’s work force and economic development is one of the major goals of the general assembly; and</p>
<p class="p6">Our state’s top educators have been calling for school reform that will help produce a higher performing public school that best meets the educational needs of students; and</p>
<p class="p6">The governor is calling upon our state’s business leaders to join the crusade for school change and reform by becoming involved in school issues and by being part of the solution to help improve our public schools.</p>
<p class="p6">The business education roundtable has been a catalyst for the involvement of our business leaders in school reform; and</p>
<p class="p6">The school improvement report of 2001 found that a significant number of Rhode Island middle schools performed poorly. In addition, the 2002 middle school performance analysis showed similar results; and</p>
<p class="p6">The “Rhode Island Middle School Reform Act of 2004” is designed to improve education in all the middle schools in Rhode Island.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The legislature recognizes that it is clearly in the public interest for the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and the Community College of Rhode Island to seek private funding in support of initiatives which promote academic excellence and educational access. The legislature further finds that the creation of endowed academic chairs enhances the ability of Rhode Island’s three (3) public institutions of higher education to offer quality instruction and that additional scholarship funding will provide opportunities for students to pursue their educational and occupational goals. It is, therefore, declared to be the policy of the state to encourage private fundraising for these purposes by the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and the Community College of Rhode Island and to assist such fundraising through a matching program to be known as the public higher education academic excellence and student access endowment incentive program.</p>

<p class="p6">The general assembly hereby finds, determines and declares that when a student is a victim of dating violence, his or her academic life suffers and his or her safety at school is jeopardized. The general assembly therefore finds that a policy to create an environment free of dating violence shall be a part of each school district. It is the intent of the general assembly to enact legislation that would require each school district to establish a policy for responding to incidents of dating violence and to provide dating violence education to students, parents, staff, faculty and administrators, in order to prevent dating violence and to address incidents involving dating violence. All students have a right to work and study in a safe, supportive environment that is free from harassment, intimidation and violence.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The general assembly hereby finds that attending high quality early childhood education programs help children develop important social and cognitive skills and knowledge that prepares children to succeed in school. Research has shown long-lasting benefits for children who participate in very high quality, educationally focused early childhood programs. The benefits to children can also generate substantial government cost savings, including reduced need for special education services, reduced need for cash assistance and other public benefits, and reduced rates of incarceration.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The general assembly finds that there are substantial numbers of children in Rhode Island entering kindergarten who are not adequately prepared to succeed in school. Early school failure may ultimately contribute to such children dropping out of school at an early age, failing to achieve their full potential, becoming dependent upon public assistance, or becoming involved in criminal activities.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Furthermore, the general assembly finds that there is an existing infrastructure of early childhood programs in Rhode Island serving preschool age children in full-day and half-day programs that is supported through state and federal investments in child care, Head Start and special education. It is the goal of the general assembly to support a system of publicly-funded, high quality prekindergarten education programs that are operated through a diverse delivery network, including child care, Head Start and public school districts.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The general assembly also finds that in 2005, seventy-four percent (74%) of children ages six (6) to seventeen (17) in Rhode Island had all parents in the workforce, higher than the U.S. average of sixty-eight percent (68%). On school days, the hours between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. are the peak hours for juvenile crime and experimentation with drug, alcohol, cigarettes and sex. Differences in summer learning accounted for sixty-five percent (65%) of the gap in reading scores between upper-income students who went to four (4) year colleges and low-income high-school dropouts.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The high schools of the state of Rhode Island play an integral role in preparing students for college and work in the 21st century. The high school outcomes improvement act recognizes that high school success is more important than ever for the health of our economy, for civic life, and to ensure equal opportunity. It is of critical importance to the success of our public high schools to prepare all students for college and work in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Without accurate data on graduation rates it is extremely difficult to evaluate the efficacy of the state’s system of public education. Better information can lead to better policies and program implementation.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Parents and community members, who are critical to ensuring strong educational accountability, are hampered in their efforts to improve our schools if they do not have accurate data.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> It is of critical importance that accurate data be collected, maintained, analyzed and publicly reported by our state’s education system with respect to high school student graduation rates.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> In the state of Rhode Island, existing data from independent researchers indicates that when graduation rates are broken down by racial and ethnic group, by students with disabilities compared to their non-disabled peers, by English language learners and by socio-economically disadvantaged students compared to non-disadvantaged peers, that many of these sub-groups are experiencing particularly low rates of high school graduation.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> Ultimately, the state of Rhode Island is committed to develop and implement a student-unit-record data system, with unique student identifiers that can track students through the state’s education system from kindergarten through post-secondary education.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> The state must commit to developing and maintaining a data and public reporting system that accurately accounts for all students when calculating high school graduation rates and informs the public of progress toward the goal of universal high school graduation.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> “Graduation Rate Formula” defines the formula for calculating the graduation rate as the number of students who earned an “on time” diploma divided by the number of students who formed the four (4) year adjusted cohort for that graduation class. It may be expressed as follows: Graduation rate= (On time graduates in year x) divided by (the number of students who entered grade 9 together in year x-4) + (transfers) — (transfers out and deceased).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> “Four-Year Adjusted Cohort” is defined as the students who entered grade 9 together; and, any students that transferred into the district in grade 10 through 12. Students that the district can confirm have either transferred out of the district, or are deceased, are removed from the cohort. All other students, including those retained in grade, those who enroll in a GED program, or take leave of school for any other reason, are not counted as transfers and remain in the “four-year adjusted cohort.” Students who are retained in grade, or take leave of school and return are counted only once as part of their initial “four-year adjusted cohort.”</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> “Transfers In” are students who entered any high school after the beginning of the entering cohort’s first year in high school in the district up to and including grade 12.</p>

Confirmation of transfer to another school/program shall be in the form of formal, written documentation that the student enrolled in the receiving school. “Transfers Out” does not include students enrolled in a GED or other alternative educational program that does not issue or provide credits toward the issuance of a regular high school diploma.</p>

<p class="p6">The general assembly hereby finds and declares: (1) Concussions are one of the most commonly reported injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not properly evaluated and managed.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with obstacles. Concussions occur with or without loss of consciousness, but the vast majority occurs without loss of consciousness.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a head injury leaves the young athlete especially vulnerable to greater injury and even death.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(1) In 2000, the Rhode Island general assembly passed, and the governor signed into law, ‘Genocide and Human Rights Education’ (P.L. 2000, ch. 511, § 1), requiring the Rhode Island department of education to ‘develop curricular material on genocide and human rights issues and guidelines for the teaching of that material.’</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(3) In 2016, the Rhode Island general assembly passed, and the governor signed into law, P.L. 2016, ch. 92, § 2 and P.L. 2016, ch. 104, § 2, to require that the Holocaust and genocide be taught in public middle and high schools.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(4) Throughout the years, the general assembly has consistently passed resolutions condemning the Holocaust and genocides. Since the passage of the legislation into law, to require Holocaust and genocide education in its schools, the general assembly has recognized its importance by honoring its passage with continued resolutions of its observance.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(5) The governor, legislators, and community leaders have always made it a priority to attend and participate in Holocaust and genocide memorials and other related events to emphasize the continued need to recognize the horrible tragedies and atrocities committed to ancestors of Rhode Island state community members.”</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Research supports a positive correlation between family engagement with a student’s school or school district and the performance of the student, school, and district. Students whose parents are involved in their education have better school attendance, earn higher grades and higher test scores, are subject to fewer disciplinary problems, and have a greater long-term success following graduation from high school.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The benefits of greater family engagement also extend to families and teachers. Parents develop more confidence in the school and in themselves as parents. Teachers experience improved morale and receive more support from families.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> It is often difficult to obtain a comprehensive amount of feedback from all stakeholders across the educational spectrum when making educational policy. Well-intentioned education-related initiatives which are introduced or produced without sufficient feedback or input from families/guardians of students involved often produces negative feedback from these families/guardians, which results in potentially effective initiatives being interrupted or abandoned altogether.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The creation of a state-wide family engagement advisory council would help to streamline this process and promote the implementation of strong, positive educational initiatives.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Beginning August 2016, each school district must offer full-day kindergarten to every eligible student to qualify for state education aid provided for in title 16. In fiscal year 2016, the Rhode Island department of elementary and secondary education shall provide funding to support transition expenses for all districts that do not offer universal full-day kindergarten programs in the 2015-2016 school year. This funding shall not exceed the amount of state aid that would otherwise have been provided to the district for operating a universal full-day kindergarten program and shall be based upon 2015 enrollment data and funding formula transition rates. For purposes of the calculation under this section, a district’s half-day kindergarten enrollment as of March 2015 shall be multiplied by two.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The state of Rhode Island is committed to providing high-quality educational opportunities for all public school students.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> School facilities provide more than a place for instruction. The physical learning environment contributes to the successful performance of educational programs designed to meet students’ educational needs.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Every student needs a safe, healthy, and sanitary learning environment that promotes student learning and development.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> School construction policies should encourage districts to reduce excess capacity through means such as partnering with other districts, closing buildings, and altering grade configurations in certain buildings to maximize the use of square feet.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> In order to maximize limited state resources, the project prioritization process should focus on projects with the most urgent and immediate need.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> State-funded school construction project financing should transition from a system that largely reimburses local debt service to one that provides a set amount of financing annually to provide greater stability from a budgetary perspective while guiding limited resources to best use.</p>

The department may also prescribe, without limitation, forms for financial assistance applications. All rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this chapter shall be promulgated in accordance with the provisions of chapter 35 of title 42, and shall apply to any projects submitted or reviewed on or after May 1, 2015.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> As part of the budget process, the governor shall specify the amount included in his/her budget recommendation that the school building authority may commit to new projects in the ensuing fiscal year, as well as any funding pursuant to § 16-105-7.

All financial assistance shall be made pursuant to a loan or financing agreement between the corporation and the city, town or LEA, acting by and through the officer or officers, board, committee, or other body authorized by law, or otherwise its chief executive officer, according to terms and conditions as determined by the corporation, and each loan shall be evidenced and secured by the issue to the corporation of city or town obligations in principal amount, bearing interest at the rate or rates specified in the applicable loan or financing agreement, and shall otherwise bear such terms and conditions as authorized by this chapter and/or the loan or financing agreement.</p>

<p class="p6">The General Assembly hereby finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Rhode Island holds a unique place in history with the establishment of its Royal Charter on July 8, 1663, that marked the first time that a sovereign leader signed a charter guaranteeing that individuals within a society were free to practice the religion of their choice without any interference from the government.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> As Rhode Island became the first American colony to declare its independence from Great Britain on May 4, 1776, it simultaneously was one of the most active slave ports in British North America within the Transatlantic Slave Trade transporting thousands of enslaved Africans to the colony, with the first documented slave ship arriving at Newport in 1696.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The contributions of African Heritage Peoples from across the African Diaspora representing all walks of life and their endeavors to learn and thrive throughout history and make unforgettable marks in our state and nation as artists, scientists, educators, businesspeople, influential thinkers, members of the faith community, athletes, and political and governmental leaders, reflects the greatness of the state of Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> The United States Department of Education says “education is primarily a state and local responsibility in the United States. It is states and communities, as well as public and private organizations of all kinds that establish schools and colleges and develop curricula.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> The state of Rhode Island also has previously demonstrated its concerns and interests regarding raising awareness on the subject of African Heritage and History through the work of the 1696 Historical Commission as established by the general assembly and signed into law on July 1, 2014, and was tasked with developing a comprehensive African Heritage History curriculum for Rhode Island public schools from kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the commission led by our secretary of state and comprised of scholars, civic and educational leaders developed and submitted a comprehensive report that included units of instruction and educational resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> With the unifying call that Black Lives Matter, for racial reconciliation, and for social justice during the summer of 2020, and citizen equity being reflected across the state, nation, and world, the establishment of an African Heritage History curriculum in Rhode Island is long overdue. Given the importance of the issue to the political affairs of the United States, as well as the responsibility of the state to educate its citizens, it is a fundamental responsibility of the state of Rhode Island to ensure that the critical subject of African Heritage History is included as part of the curriculum in all public schools. In the words of civil rights leader, Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr., “The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character — that is the goal of a true education.” Doctor King further stated, “History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.”</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> It is the judgment of the Rhode Island general assembly to encourage that every board of education in the state shall include instruction on the subject of African Heritage History studies in an appropriate place in the curriculum, for all elementary and secondary students.</p>

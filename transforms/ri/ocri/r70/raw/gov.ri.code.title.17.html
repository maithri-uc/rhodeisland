<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A regularly scheduled statewide election constitutes a general election for purposes of R.I. Const. Art. 14, § 1, even though state officers are not on the ballot. In 2008, an even-numbered year when the state’s general offices are not in contention, voters will cast their ballots for the President of the United States, a statewide and national election of no small significance. Bowen v. Mollis, 945 A.2d 314, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 47 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The 5% threshold in R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-1-2(9)(iii) to establish “political party” status, while onerous, was constitutional. The requirement had received the stamp of constitutional approval in numerous ballot access challenges dating back four decades, and against such authority, the 5% requirement did not intrude significantly on the rights of plaintiffs, and because the burden of collecting 23,588 signatures was modest, the important state interest in avoiding confusion, deception, and even frustration of the democratic process was sufficient to justify the limitation on associational and voting rights. Block v. Mollis, 618 F. Supp. 2d 142, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45796 (D.R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under any level of scrutiny, the State presented no legitimate regulatory interest whatsoever to justify the January 1 start date for obtaining signatures for political party status; while the 5% requirement for signatures alone passed constitutional muster, it could not erase the lack of justification for the late start date. The appropriate remedy was to strike the offending portion, the second sentence of R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-1-2(9), and it followed that plaintiff political party, political action committee, and party founder, were entitled to injunctive relief as to enforcement of the January 1 start date. Block v. Mollis, 618 F. Supp. 2d 142, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45796 (D.R.I. 2009).</p>

<p class="p6">Prior to the time set by law for the meeting and voting by the presidential electors, the chief election official of each member state shall determine the number of votes for each presidential slate in each state of the United States and in the District of Columbia in which votes have been cast in a statewide popular election and shall add such votes together to produce a “national popular vote total” for each presidential slate.</p>
<p class="p6">The chief election official of each member state shall designate the presidential slate with the largest national popular vote total as the “national popular vote winner.”</p>
<p class="p6">The presidential elector certifying official of each member state shall certify the appointment in that official’s own state of the elector slate nominated in that state in association with the national popular vote winner.</p>
<p class="p6">At least six (6) days before the day fixed by law for the meeting and voting by the presidential electors, each member state shall make a final determination of the number of popular votes cast in the state for each presidential slate and shall communicate an official statement of such determination within twenty-four (24) hours to the chief election official of each other member state.</p>
<p class="p6">The chief election official of each member state shall treat as conclusive an official statement containing the number of popular votes in a state for each presidential slate made by the day established by federal law for making a state’s final determination conclusive as to the counting of electoral votes by Congress.</p>
<p class="p6">In event of a tie for the national popular vote winner, the presidential elector certifying official of each member state shall certify the appointment of the elector slate nominated in association with the presidential slate receiving the largest number of popular votes within that official’s own state.</p>
<p class="p6">If, for any reason, the number of presidential electors nominated in a member state in association with the national popular vote winner is less than or greater than that state’s number of electoral votes, the presidential candidate on the presidential slate that has been designated as the national popular vote winner shall have the power to nominate the presidential electors for that state and that state’s presidential elector certifying official shall certify the appointment of such nominees.</p>
<p class="p6">The chief election official of each member state shall immediately release to the public all vote counts or statements of votes as they are determined or obtained.</p>
<p class="p6">This article shall govern the appointment of presidential electors in each member state in any year in which this agreement is, on July 20, in effect in states cumulatively possessing a majority of the electoral votes.</p>

<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>OTHER PROVISIONS.</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">This agreement shall take effect when states cumulatively possessing a majority of the electoral votes have enacted this agreement in substantially the same form and the enactments by such states have taken effect in each state.</p>
<p class="p6">Any member state may withdraw from this agreement, except that a withdrawal occurring six (6) months or less before the end of a president’s term shall not become effective until a president or vice president shall have been qualified to serve the next term.</p>
<p class="p6">The chief executive of each member state shall promptly notify the chief executive of all other states of when this agreement has been enacted and has taken effect in that official’s state, when the state has withdrawn from this agreement, and when this agreement takes effect generally.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Lists of Party Voters.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The amendment of 1958 by which the chairmen are now required to submit lists “of party voters” did not in any manner change the obligation of the appointing authority in that respect. The amendment was obviously intended to restrict the broad power to designate potential nominees formerly held by the party chairmen by requiring them to make their selection for the lists of potential nominees to be submitted to the appointing authority from among the “party voters” of their respective parties.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The party chairman is vested with final authority to determine the political status of persons nominated for membership on the board of canvassers and registration and the mayor is required to treat all persons on the Democratic list as Democrats and all persons on the Republican list as Republicans and in determining the bi-partisan membership of the board they will be presumed to belong to the political party on whose list they appeared regardless of the fact that they may admittedly belong to the other party.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature did not intend that appointing authorities would be permitted to go behind the designations of the local party chairmen and to determine for themselves whether the persons contained in such lists were in fact party voters of the chairman’s party. Neither is there anything in the act that would permit appointing authorities to make such determination of political affiliation at a time subsequent to the election of nominees to the board. Nugent ex rel. Cote v. Mullen, 92 R.I. 69, 166 A.2d 409, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 141 (1960).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While mandamus cannot be brought by a private citizen to enforce a public right, the language of the statute clearly evidences a legislative intent to grant certain special privileges not a public right to the respective political parties by vesting the respective party chairmen with the power to determine eligibility of the person or persons to be appointed on the canvassing authorities by the submission of a list, this power being vested in the party chairman and not in the party committees. Folcarelli v. Spencer, 94 R.I. 304, 180 A.2d 322, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 72 (1962).</p>

The return as undeliverable of a mailing sent to the voter by someone other than the state board or local board shall not, standing alone, constitute reasonable cause. The local board, upon receipt of the affidavit and upon finding that the affidavit establishes reasonable cause, shall cause to be mailed, by certified mail, a notification of the challenge to the challenged voter at his or her registered address. The return of the notice or acknowledgement of its receipt may be admitted as evidence at the hearing. The challenged voter shall appear before the local board at a time and place to be determined by the local board. The objector shall also be notified of the hearing. If the board finds that the affidavit does set forth reasonable cause to suspect that the challenged voter is not eligible, the voter, upon taking the following oath or affirmation, shall answer pertinent questions as provided in this section, and any other questions necessary to establish his or her eligibility.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The oath or affirmation shall be as follows:</p>

<p class="p4"><b>17-9.2-2.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Findings and purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> <b>Findings.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The legislature finds that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Voting is both a fundamental right and a civic duty. Restoring the right to vote strengthens our democracy by increasing voter participation and helps people who have completed their incarceration to reintegrate into society. Voting is an essential part of reassuming the duties of full citizenship.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Rhode Island is the only state in New England that denies the vote to people convicted of felonies, not only while they are in prison, but also while they are living in the community under the supervision of parole or probation officials.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> As a result of this extended disfranchisement, Rhode Island deprives a greater proportion of its residents of voting rights than any other state in the region. More than fifteen thousand five hundred (15,500) Rhode Islanders have lost the right to vote because of a felony conviction. Of these, eighty-six percent (86%) are not in prison, they have either been released or their convictions did not result in actual incarceration. Rhode Island has the second highest rate of people on probation in the nation.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> Criminal disfranchisement in Rhode Island has a disproportionate impact on minority communities. The rate of disfranchisement of African American voters is more than six (6) times the statewide rate. Hispanics lose the vote at more than 2.5 times the statewide average. One in five (5) black men and one in eleven (11) Hispanic men are barred from voting in Rhode Island. By denying so many the right to vote, criminal disfranchisement laws dilute the political power of entire minority communities. Because these communities are concentrated in cities, the urban vote is also suppressed, with the rate of disfranchisement in urban areas 3.5 times the rate in the rest of the state.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> Extending disfranchisement beyond a person’s term of incarceration complicates the process of restoring the right to vote. Under current law, a person may regain that right when released from incarceration if no parole follows, when discharged from parole, or when probation is completed. This system requires the involvement of many government agencies in the restoration process. This bill would simplify restoration by making people eligible to vote once they have served their time in prison, thereby concentrating in the department of corrections the responsibility for initiating restoration of voting rights. A streamlined restoration process conserves government resources and saves taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> <b>Purpose.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The purposes of this act are to strengthen democratic institutions by increasing participation in the voting process, to help people who have completed prison sentences to become productive members of society, and to streamline procedures for restoring their right to vote.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> A person who has lost the right of suffrage under Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution of Rhode Island because of such person’s incarceration upon a felony conviction shall be restored the right to vote when that person is discharged from incarceration.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony, and before imposing a felony sentence after trial, the court shall notify the defendant that conviction will result in loss of the right to vote only if and for as long as the person is incarcerated and that voting rights are restored upon discharge.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The department of corrections shall act as a voter registration agency in accordance with § 17-9.1-8. In this capacity, and as part of the release process leading to a person’s discharge from a correctional facility, the department of corrections shall notify that person in writing that voting rights will be restored, provide that person with a voter registration form and a declination form, and offer that person assistance in filling out the appropriate form. Unless the registrant refuses to permit it to do so, the department of corrections shall transmit the completed voter registration form to the state board or local board where the registrant resides.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The department of corrections shall, on or before the 15th day of each month, transmit to the secretary of state two (2) lists. The first shall contain the following information about persons convicted of a felony who, during the preceding period, have become ineligible to vote because of their incarceration; the second shall contain the following information about persons convicted of a felony who, during the preceding period, have become eligible to vote because of their discharge from incarceration:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> name;</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The secretary of state shall ensure that the statewide central voter registration is purged of the names of persons who are ineligible to vote because of their incarceration upon a felony conviction. The secretary of state shall likewise ensure that the names of persons who are eligible and registered to vote following their discharge from incarceration are added to the statewide central voter register in the same manner as all other names are added to that register.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The secretary of state shall ensure that persons who have become eligible to vote because of their discharge from incarceration face no continued barriers to registration or voting resulting from their felony convictions.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> The secretary of state shall develop and implement a program to educate attorneys, judges, election officials, corrections officials, and members of the public about the requirements of this section, ensuring that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Judges are informed of their obligation to notify criminal defendants of the potential loss and restoration of their voting rights in accordance with subsection (b) hereof.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The language on voter registration forms makes clear that people who have been disqualified from voting because of felony convictions regain the right to vote when they are discharged from incarceration.</p>

The local board of each city or town shall determine voting districts by geographical boundaries and by no other means. No voting district shall at any time comprise parts of two (2) or more wards. It shall be the duty of the board to divide the city or town, representative district, or ward, so that substantially not more than three thousand (3000) total eligible registered voters shall be served by the same polling place; provided, however, that any divisions conducted by the local board pursuant to this section shall not result in creating a polling place serving less than five hundred (500) total eligible registered voters, except when a polling place is located in a low-income or elderly residential development, or when it is caused by legislative district boundaries; and provided, further, that no existing polling place which is presently located in a low-income or elderly residential development shall be eliminated. Upon the establishment and approval of any polling place by the state board, changes to the polling place shall not be allowed until the next redistricting by the general assembly, unless the polling place becomes unavailable to the city or town, or no longer meets polling place minimum requirements as established by the state board, then the city or town may take the appropriate action to replace the polling place. A polling place may be located either within or without the voting district for which it is established; provided, that a polling place may be located outside the district only upon unanimous determination of the local board and subject to the approval of the state board that a suitable place is not available within the voting district.</p>

Collins v. State Bd. of Elections, 480 A.2d 408, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 594 (R.I. 1984).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Though the state has a legitimate interest in the prevention of raiding, a 26-month restriction encompassing two primaries before a switch may be made in party affiliation was overly broad and was an infringement on the right to vote and the freedom of association as prescribed in the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.Yale v. Curvin, 345 F. Supp. 447, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12717 (D.R.I. 1972) (Decision prior to 1978 amendment).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To the extent this section prohibits any otherwise eligible voter from voting in a party’s primary when the party’s bylaws would permit them to do so, it unconstitutionally infringes on the party’s members’ freedom of association.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the state failed to articulate any legitimate interest for the restriction of this section on the ability of a party to invite registered voters from other parties to participate in its primary, the court affirmed the district court’s ruling that prohibiting such voters was unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibited them from voting in the primary of another party whose bylaws would permit their participation.

The bipartisan pair shall also make a proper notation on the certified voter list that the applicant has voted in the election. If the bipartisan pair cannot locate the voter’s name on the certified voting list for the voting district the bipartisan pair shall direct the voter to the clerk who shall review the certified list for the city or town and determine if the voter is registered to vote and in which voting district they are eligible to vote. The bipartisan pair of supervisors shall provide the voter with the appropriate computer ballot and security sleeve.

<p class="p6">Ballots voted for any person whose name does not appear on the ballot as a nominated candidate for office are referred to in this section as “irregular ballots.” In voting for presidential electors, a voter may vote an irregular ticket made up of the names of persons in nomination by different parties; or partly of names of persons in nomination and partly of names of persons not in nomination; or wholly of names of persons not in nomination by any party. Scanned images of the computer ballot containing the irregular ballot shall be stored digitally on physical electronic media in the optical-scan precinct-count unit. With that exception, no irregular ballot shall be voted for any person for any office whose name appears on the ballot as a nominated candidate for that office; any irregular ballot so voted shall not be counted. An irregular ballot must be cast in its appropriate place on the ballot, or it shall be void and not counted and no irregular ballots shall be counted at primaries; provided, that at any presidential primary, irregular ballots shall be counted for those persons whose names have been written in for the office of president. At the close of the polls, irregular ballots shall be packaged according to § 17-19-33 and shall be immediately delivered to the local board of canvassers. The local board shall receive the tape from the optical precinct-count unit containing printed images of each written name on the irregular ballots, or the physical electronic media containing images of the irregular ballots and record all write-in votes cast for all federal, state, and local races listed on the tape. The local board shall notify the state board of the results through a procedure promulgated by the state board.</p>

All candidates for state and federal office, as well as all state party chairpersons, shall be given notice by telephone or otherwise of the day on which ballots affecting that candidate’s district will be certified; provided, that failure to effect the notice shall in no way invalidate the ballots.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> This processing shall be done within a railed space in the room in which it takes place, and the board shall admit within the railed space, in accordance with those rules that the board shall adopt, to witness the processing and certification of the ballots, the interested voter or the voter’s representative, the candidates, or at least one representative of each candidate for whom votes are at the time being processed, and an equal number of representatives of each political party. These representatives shall be authorized in writing by the voter, the candidate, or the chairperson of the state committee of the political party, respectively, as the case may be.

These guidelines shall recognize that if a ballot can be reasonably identified to be that of the voter it purports to be, and if it can reasonably be determined that the voter was eligible to vote by mail ballot and if the requirements of § 17-20-2.1 were complied with, it should not be subject to frivolous or technical challenge. The burden of proof in challenging a mail ballot as not obtained and/or cast in conformance with this chapter is on the person challenging the ballot. Once the irregularity is shown, the burden of proof shall shift to the person defending the ballot to demonstrate that it is the ballot of the voter it purports to be, that the voter was eligible to vote by mail ballot, and that all of the applicable requirements of § 17-20-2.1 were complied with. The guidelines shall be adopted at a public meeting of the board and shall be made available prior to the start of the certification process for mail ballots.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In examining the constitutionality of the Rhode Island Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-1 et seq., the magnitude of the burden imposed on First Amendment rights is a factor to be considered in determining the level of statutory scrutiny. R.I. Affiliate v. Begin, 431 F.

<p class="p7"><b>Construction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Rhode Island Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-1 et seq., contains both a general severability clause, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-17(a), and a clause stating that the application of any provision to ballot question referenda is severable from the application of that provision to candidate elections, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-17(b). These clauses strongly suggest a legislative intent that, if any of the provisions of the Rhode Island Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act are invalidated, the remaining provisions should be enforced. R.I. Affiliate v. Begin, 431 F. Supp. 2d 227, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27977 (D.R.I. 2006).</p>

However, since so much time had passed, and the available remedy was so nominal, the case no longer presented a sufficiently genuine case or controversy to warrant further review. R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, by mandating public revelation of all Political Action Committee contributors, burdens the rights of individuals to band together for the purpose of making either independent election expenditures or direct political contributions, and, by imposing this burden on PACs and PAC contributors while regulating candidates and their financial backers (viz., individuals who contribute directly to candidates rather than to PACs) more loosely, the statute compounds the unfairness of the burden. Finally, the disparity between the two disclosure thresholds (one for PACs and the other for individuals), and, hence, the net burden imposed solely on associational rights, bears no substantial relation to the attainment of any important state interest.

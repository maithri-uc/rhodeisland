Despite the necessity for strict construction of statutes providing for attorney’s fees, the phrase “for any reason” creates a broad standard that includes a beneficiary’s outright refusal to release a fiduciary of personal liability in exchange for receiving her share of the trust assets.

If the event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred and no substitute custodian able, willing, and eligible to serve was nominated under § 18-7-4, the person who made the nomination may nominate a substitute custodian under § 18-7-4; otherwise, the transferor or the transferor’s legal representative shall designate a substitute custodian at the time of the transfer, in either case from among the persons eligible to serve as custodian for that kind of property under § 18-7-10(a).

If a trustee of an existing trust proposes to make a qualified disposition pursuant to the provisions of this subsection (c) of this section but the trust would not conform to the requirements of subparagraph 18-9.2-2(10)(ii)(B) as a result of the original transferor’s nonconforming powers of appointment, then, upon the trustee’s delivery to the qualified trustee of an irrevocable written election to have this subsection apply to the trust, the nonconforming powers of appointment shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to conform with subparagraph 18-9.2-2(10)(ii)(B).

Upon such trustee’s ceasing to be trustee, such trustee shall have no power or authority other than to convey the trust property to the successor trustee named in the trust instrument or appointment by the Superior Court in accordance with this subsection.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Subject to the intent of a donor expressed in the gift instrument [and to subsection (d)], an institution may appropriate for expenditure or accumulate so much of an endowment fund as the institution determines is prudent for the uses, benefits, purposes, and duration for which the endowment fund is established. Unless stated otherwise in the gift instrument, the assets in an endowment fund are donor-restricted assets until appropriated for expenditure by the institution. In making a determination to appropriate or accumulate, the institution shall act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, and shall consider, if relevant, the following factors:</p>

<p class="p6">A power of attorney which satisfies the requirements of § 18-16-2(b) is not prevented from being a statutory short form power of attorney, as that phrase is used in the sections of this chapter, by the fact that it also contains additional language which:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Eliminates from the power of attorney one or more of the powers enumerated in one or more of the constructional sections of this chapter with respect to a subdivision of the statutory short form power of attorney not eliminated from the form by the principal;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Supplements one or more of the powers enumerated in one or more of the constructional sections in this chapter with respect to a subdivision of the statutory short form power of attorney not eliminated from the form by the principal, by specifically listing additional powers of the agent; or</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Makes some additional provision that is not inconsistent with the other provisions of the statutory short form power of attorney.</p>

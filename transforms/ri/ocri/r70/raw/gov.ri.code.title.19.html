<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Any mutual savings bank chartered under the laws of this state may convert to and become a financial institution with capital stock upon adoption of a plan of conversion by two-thirds (2/3) vote of the board of trustees and approval of the plan by the director, or the director’s designee, and a majority vote of the depositors of the savings bank present in person or by proxy at a meeting called by the board of trustees. For the purpose of this section, unless otherwise required under applicable provisions of federal banking law, the depositor shall be deemed to be the individual whose tax identification number or social security number is used by the bank for interest reporting purposes to the Internal Revenue Service. The plan of conversion shall provide that the savings bank shall issue and sell the stock issued in connection with the conversion at a price that represents its pro forma market value, as determined by an independent appraisal, and shall offer its stock initially in a subscription offering to the depositors of the savings bank on an eligibility record date established by the board of trustees, giving those depositors priority rights to purchase the shares over the general public pro rata based on deposits. The converted savings bank shall also create a liquidation account for the benefit of its depositors on the eligibility record date, in an amount representing the undivided profits and guaranty fund of the savings bank at that time, balances of which shall be calculated and subsequently recalculated as determined in accordance with regulations promulgated by the director, or the director’s designee. Unless otherwise impaired, any liquidation account so created also shall be considered as part of the paid-in and unimpaired capital stock and surplus of any stock financial institution. The plan of conversion may provide for restrictions on the amount of stock that any person or entity may purchase in the conversion, or own or control thereafter, which may also be incorporated into the stock agreement to form the converted entity.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> In connection with the conversion, the financial institution may form a holding company or utilize an existing holding company to hold all the shares of the financial institution, and offer to its depositors and general public (subject to subscription rights in favor of depositors) all of the stock of the holding company in lieu of the capital stock of the financial institution. This conversion may also be accomplished pursuant to a merger as permitted by this title. The converting savings bank may, at the time of conversion, merge any financial institution subsidiary into the capital stock financial institution resulting from the conversion, or cause the subsidiary to become a separate subsidiary of a holding company.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> No savings bank may convert to a stock form of financial institution unless its deposits will continue to be federally insured. The corporate existence of a mutual savings bank converting to the stock financial institution shall not terminate, but the financial institution shall be deemed to be a continuation of entity of the savings bank so converted.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> In connection with its approval of the plan of conversion, the director, or the director’s designee, shall approve the proposed stock agreement to form the converted entity.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Any mutual savings bank chartered under the laws of this state may reorganize into the mutual holding company form of organization pursuant to this section. A mutual savings bank may reorganize into a mutual holding company form of organization by organizing a mutual holding company and chartering one or more interim stock financial institutions or corporate subsidiaries and merging with those banks or subsidiaries, or in any other manner approved by the director. The method of organizing the mutual holding company shall be set forth in a plan of mutual holding company reorganization. The corporate existence of a mutual savings bank converting to a stock financial institution as part of the reorganizing into the mutual holding company structure shall not terminate, but the stock financial institution, referred to in this section as the continuing stock financial institution, shall be deemed to be a continuation of the reorganizing mutual savings bank. The mutual holding company must at all times own, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediate stock holding companies, a majority of the voting shares of capital stock of the continuing stock financial institution. A mutual holding company organized under this section also may include an intermediate stock holding company so long as the mutual holding company owns a majority of the voting shares of capital stock of the intermediate stock holding company.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The plan of mutual holding company reorganization must be approved by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the board of trustees and by the director, or the director’s designee. In connection with its approval of the plan of mutual holding company reorganization, the director, or the director’s designee, shall approve the proposed agreement to form and the proposed bylaws of the mutual holding company. The approval of the plan of mutual holding company reorganization by a majority vote of the depositors of the mutual savings bank present in person or by proxy at a meeting called by the board of trustees is also required. For the purpose of this section, unless otherwise required under applicable provisions of federal banking law, the depositor shall be deemed to be the individual whose tax identification number or social security number is used by the bank for interest reporting purposes to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> To the extent not inconsistent with this section, the continuing stock financial institution subsidiary of the mutual holding company shall have all the powers and privileges conferred on, and be subject to all the duties and liabilities imposed on, financial institutions.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> If shares of common stock are offered for sale by the continuing stock financial institution subsidiary of the mutual holding company, or by an intermediate stock holding company subsidiary of the mutual holding company, to the general public for a price payable in cash, depositors shall be given subscription rights, and the offering shall be conducted in the manner provided in § 19-2-14, and in any regulations issued by the director, or the director’s designee, under that section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> A mutual holding company and any intermediate stock holding company subsidiary may engage in any activity permitted to bank holding companies and financial holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 U.S.C. § 1841 et seq., or to savings and loan and mutual holding companies under the Home Owners’ Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1467a, or in any other activity authorized by the director, or the director’s designee. Without limitation, a mutual holding company, and any intermediate stock holding company subsidiary, may, subject to other applicable provisions of title 19 governing mergers and consolidations and, with the approval of the director, or the director’s designee: (1) Merge with or consolidate with another bank, financial services, or savings and loan holding company, including a mutual holding company; or (2) Acquire or consolidate with another financial institution, whether in mutual or stock form. Any merger or consolidation may occur concurrently with a mutual holding company reorganization under this section, or subsequent to the initial reorganization, and cash and/or stock may be used as consideration for the merger or consolidation as long as the mutual holding company directly or indirectly owns a majority of the voting shares of capital stock of the intermediate stock holding company or stock financial institution after the merger or consolidation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> A mutual holding company may convert to stock form upon a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the board of trustees and the approval of the plan of conversion by the director, or the director’s designee. The conversion shall be conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of § 19-2-14, including the requirement to obtain depositor approval, and any regulations issued under § 19-2-14 by the director, or the director’s designee. In the case of the conversion of an existing mutual holding company to stock form, where shares of common stock of an intermediate stock holding company or stock financial institution subsidiary of the mutual holding company have previously been issued to persons other than the mutual holding company, referred to in this section as the minority stockholders, the plan of conversion shall provide that such minority stockholders shall receive an ownership interest in the resulting stock holding company equal to their percentage ownership in the intermediate stock holding company or stock financial institution subsidiary of the mutual holding company immediately prior to the conversion, which percentage ownership interest shall be adjusted taking into account the assets held by the mutual holding company, as reflected in the statement of financial condition of the mutual holding company immediately prior to the conversion, with the balance of the shares sold in accordance with § 19-2-14 and any regulations issued under that section. The adjustment, which shall be described in the plan of mutual holding company conversion submitted for approval by the director, or the director’s designee, shall be subject to the approval of the director, or the director’s designee.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Any credit union chartered under the laws of this state may convert to and become a financial institution chartered under the laws of this state or another financial services entity chartered under the laws of the United States. The conversion shall not require the prior liquidation of the subject credit union. In the event that any credit union chartered under the laws of this state elects to convert to and become a financial institution chartered under the laws of this state, the credit union shall first demonstrate compliance with the various requirements of Chapter 2 of this title, as appropriate. In the alternative, in the event that any credit union chartered under the laws of this state elects to convert to and become another form of financial services entity chartered under the laws of the United States, the credit union shall first demonstrate compliance with the various requirements of the federal laws and regulations governing the chartering of that designated financial services entity.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Any credit union chartered under the laws of this state may convert to and become a financial institution chartered under the laws of this state or another form of financial services entity chartered under the laws of the United States upon adoption of a plan of conversion by two-thirds (2/3) vote of the board of directors and approval of the plan by the director, or the director’s designee, and a majority vote of those members of the credit union qualified to vote pursuant to § 19-5-7 who are present in person or by proxy at a meeting called by the board of directors. For the purpose of this section, unless otherwise required under applicable provisions of federal or state banking law, a member shall be deemed to be the individual whose tax identification number or social security number is used by the credit union for interest reporting purposes to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> In the event that the plan of conversion calls for the issuance of capital stock, it shall also provide that the converted entity shall issue and sell the stock issued in connection with the conversion at a price that represents its pro forma market value, as determined by an independent appraisal, and shall offer its stock initially in a subscription offering to the members of the credit union on an eligibility record date established by the board of directors, giving those members priority rights to purchase the shares over the general public pro rata based on deposits. The converted credit union shall also create a liquidation account for the benefit of its members on the eligibility record date, in an amount representing the total equity of the credit union at the time, the balances of which shall be calculated and subsequently recalculated as determined in accordance with regulations promulgated by the director, or the director’s designee. Unless otherwise impaired, any liquidation account so created also shall be considered as part of the paid-in and unimpaired capital stock and surplus of the newly chartered stock financial institution or financial services entity. The plan of conversion may provide for restrictions on the amount of stock that any person or entity may purchase in the conversion, or own or control thereafter, which may also be incorporated into the stock agreement to form the converted entity.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> In connection with the conversion, the financial institution or other financial services entity may form a holding company or utilize an existing holding company to hold all the shares of the financial institution or other financial services entity, and offer to its depositors and general public (subject to subscription rights in favor of depositors) all of the stock of the holding company in lieu of the capital stock of the financial institution or other financial services entity. This conversion may also be accomplished pursuant to a merger.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> No credit union may convert to a financial institution or other financial services entity unless its deposits will continue to be federally insured. The corporate existence of a credit union converting to the financial institution or other financial services entity shall not terminate, but the financial institution or other financial services entity shall be deemed to be a continuation of the corporate entity credit union so converted.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> In connection with its approval of any plan of conversion to a financial institution chartered under the laws of this state, the director, or the director’s designee, shall approve the proposed agreement to form and the proposed bylaws of the converted entity. The director, or the director’s designee, upon finding that the requirements of this section and applicable regulations have been met (including, when applicable, that the conversion to any entity issuing stock has been completed with the sale of all shares offered in the conversion to a stock form of financial institution), shall issue a certificate of approval of the conversion to the converted entity. Upon the payment of fifty dollars ($50.00), the certificate of approval shall be filed with the secretary of state, together with the certificate of the general treasurer that the converted entity has paid into the treasury for the use of the state a sum equal to one tenth of one percent (.10%) of its capital stock which in no event shall be less than one hundred dollars ($100). Upon the filing of the certificate with the secretary of state and payment of fifty dollars ($50.00), the secretary of state shall immediately record the certificate of approval and any agreement to form, at which time the agreement to form will become effective.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> The director, or the director’s designee, shall issue rules and regulations implementing this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> To the extent not inconsistent with this section, each credit union so converted into a financial institution chartered under the laws of this state shall have all the powers and privileges conferred on, and be subject to all the duties and liabilities imposed on, those financial institutions and each credit union so converted into a financial services entity chartered under the laws of the United States shall have all the powers and privileges conferred on, and be subject to all the duties and liabilities imposed on, those federally chartered financial services entity.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A sensible interpretation of former § 19-19-1 as given by the United States Supreme Court to a like federal statute would equate the terms “makes” and “causes to be made.” State v. Mollicone, 654 A.2d 311, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 39 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since there was ample evidence to support a jury finding of an intent to deceive as required by former § 19-19-1, the fact that the scheme was ultimately unsuccessful did not vitiate the intent, nor did it palliate the offense.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Neither § 11-18-1 nor § 11-18-6 relates to the protection of the same interest as did former § 19-19-1, because the two misdemeanor statutes are designed to control external transmissions of false information, whereas former § 19-19-1 was designed to protect the integrity of the internal records of a bank for the protection of its depositors; therefore, neither of the misdemeanors bears the necessary inherent relationship to the felony offense to make it a lesser included offense.

<p class="p6">Any financial institution with capital stock chartered under the laws of this state and that is solvent may, upon notice to the director, or the director’s designee, pursuant to § 19-10.1-2 and subject to the approval of the director, or the director’s designee, convert to and become a general business corporation organized under the Rhode Island Business Corporation Act, chapter 1.2 of title 7, or another financial services entity chartered under the laws of the United States. As a condition of such conversion, such financial institution shall amend its agreement to form a financial institution, and where applicable for financial institutions organized before December 31, 1995, the articles of incorporation or the agreement of association of the financial institution, such amendment to be by a vote of its stockholders owning two-thirds (2/3) of its capital stock. For the purpose of closing out any depository or other exclusively financial institution related business activities authorized pursuant to § 19-3-1, the directors or trustees of the financial institution shall submit to the director, or the director’s designee, for approval either: (a) A plan, satisfactory in form and content to the director, or the director’s designee, for termination of any remaining depository or other transactions entered into under or pursuant to the powers, rights or activities reserved to financial institutions under § 19-3-1 and to which such entity remains to be a party; or (b) A certification, satisfactory in form and content to the director, or the director’s designee, to the effect that all such depository and other banking related transactions have been terminated for at least one (1) year. The director, or the director’s designee, shall, upon timely completion of its review and approval of the plan or certification, issue an approval and consent for the conversion. The conversion shall not require the prior liquidation of the subject entity. The corporate existence of such entity shall not terminate and such entity shall be deemed to be a continuation of the previously existing financial institution, absent any powers of deposit taking or other powers exclusively reserved to financial institutions under § 19-3-1. Upon issuance of the approval by the director, or the director’s designee, for such conversion, the secretary of state shall be so notified and the agreement to form, or for financial institutions organized before December 31, 1995, the articles of incorporation or the agreement of association, of the financial institution shall be amended by filing an amendment with the secretary of state so as to change the name of the entity to one containing words other than those identified with a financial institution and to otherwise conform its articles of incorporation or agreement of association with the requirements of a business corporation organized under the Rhode Island Business Corporation Act, chapter 1.2 of title 7.</p>

The interest so provided for by this chapter anticipates timely repayment, in consecutive equal monthly installments, for a period of one year.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> “Federal reimbursement rates” means the current listed fee schedule from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, listing the current Healthcare Common Procedure Coding system (HCPCS) and the corresponding reimbursement rates.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> “Orthosis” means a custom fabricated brace or support that is designed based on medical necessity. Orthosis does not include prefabricated or direct-formed orthotic devices, as defined in this section, or any of the following assistive technology devices: commercially available knee orthoses used following injury or surgery; spastic muscle-tone inhibiting orthoses; upper extremity adaptive equipment; finger splints; hand splints; wrist gauntlets; face masks used following burns; wheelchair seating that is an integral part of the wheelchair and not worn by the patient independent of the wheelchair; fabric or elastic supports; corsets; low-temperature formed plastic splints; trusses; elastic hose; canes; crutches; cervical collars; dental appliances; and other similar devices as determined by the director of the department of health, such as those commonly carried in stock by a pharmacy, department store, corset shop, or surgical supply facility.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> “Orthotics” means the science and practice of evaluating, measuring, designing, fabricating, assembling, fitting, adjusting or servicing, as well as providing the initial training necessary to accomplish the fitting of, an orthosis for the support, correction, or alleviation of neuromuscular or musculoskeletal dysfunction, disease, injury, or deformity. The practice of orthotics encompasses evaluation, treatment, and consultation; with basic observational gait and postural analysis, orthotists assess and design orthoses to maximize function and provide not only the support but the alignment necessary to either prevent or correct a deformity or to improve the safety and efficiency of mobility or locomotion or both. Orthotic practice includes providing continuing patient care in order to assess its effect on the patient’s tissues and to assure proper fit and function of the orthotic device by periodic evaluation.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> “Prosthesis” means an artificial limb that is alignable or, in lower-extremity applications, capable of weight bearing. Prosthesis means an artificial medical device that is not surgically implanted and that is used to replace a missing limb, appendage, or other external human body part, including an artificial limb, hand, or foot. The term does not include artificial eyes, ears, noses, dental appliances, osotmy products, or devices such as eyelashes or wigs.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> “Prosthetics” means the science and practice of evaluation, measuring, designing, fabricating, assembling, fitting, aligning, adjusting, or servicing, as well as providing the initial training necessary to accomplish the fitting of, a prosthesis through the replacement of external parts of a human body lost due to amputation or congenital deformities or absences. The practice of prosthetics also includes the generation of an image, form, or mold that replicates the patient’s body or body segment and that requires rectification of dimensions, contours, and volumes for use in the design and fabrication of a socket to accept a residual anatomic limb to, in turn, create an artificial appendage that is designed either to support body weight or to improve or restore function or cosmesis, or both. Involved in the practice of prosthetics is observational gait analysis and clinical assessment of the requirements necessary to refine and mechanically fix the relative position of various parts of the prosthesis to maximize function, stability, and safety of the patient. The practice of prosthetics includes providing and continuing patient care in order to assess the prosthetic device’s effect on the patient’s tissues and to assure proper fit and function of the prosthetic device by periodic evaluation.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> “Private insurance company” means any insurance company, or management company hired by an insurance company, that is any of the following:</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> A health insurance contract, plan, or policy may require prior authorization for orthotic and prosthetic devices in the same manner that prior authorization is required for any other covered benefit.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Covered benefits for orthotic or prosthetic devices shall be limited to the most appropriate model that adequately meets the medical needs of the patient as determined by the insured’s treating physician.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The activities of mortgage loan originators and the origination or offering of financing for residential real property have a direct, valuable, and immediate impact upon Rhode Island’s consumers, Rhode Island’s economy, the neighborhoods and communities of Rhode Island, and the housing and real estate industry. The general assembly finds that accessibility to mortgage credit is vital to the state’s citizens. The general assembly also finds that it is essential for the protection of the citizens of Rhode Island and the stability of Rhode Island’s economy that reasonable standards for licensing and regulation of the business practices of mortgage loan originators be imposed. The general assembly further finds that the obligations of mortgage loan originators to consumers in connection with originating or making residential mortgage loans are such as to warrant the regulation of the mortgage lending process. The purpose of this chapter is to protect consumers seeking mortgage loans and to ensure that the mortgage lending industry is operating without unfair, deceptive, and fraudulent practices on the part of mortgage loan originators. Therefore the general assembly establishes within this chapter:</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The legislature finds that franchisees may suffer substantial losses when the franchisor does not provide complete information regarding the franchisor and the franchise relationship. The legislature also finds that many franchisees lack bargaining power and purchase a franchise when they are unfamiliar with operating a business, the franchised business and with industry practices in franchising. The act seeks to ensure that each offeree receives the information necessary to make an informed decision about the offered franchise. Further, it is the intent of this chapter to prohibit the sale of franchises when there is a likelihood that the franchisor’s promises will not be fulfilled.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> A student loan servicer shall provide annually, and at the request of a student loan borrower, the terms of their loan, progress toward repayment, and eligibility for any loan relief programs including, but not limited to, income-driven repayment plans, public service loan forgiveness, forbearance, and deferment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> A student loan servicer shall establish policies and procedures, and implement them consistently, in order to facilitate evaluation of private student loan alternative repayment arrangement requests, including providing accurate information regarding any private student loan alternative repayment arrangements that may be available to the borrower through the promissory note, or that may have been marketed to the borrower through marketing materials.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> A private student loan alternative repayment arrangement shall consider the affordability of repayment plans for a distressed borrower, as well as the investor, guarantor, and insurer guidelines, and previous outcome and performance information.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> If a student loan servicer offers private student loan repayment arrangements, a student loan servicer shall consistently present and offer those arrangements to borrowers with similar financial circumstances.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> If a borrower inquires of a servicer of private student loans about consolidating or refinancing a federal student loan into a private student loan, the servicer of private student loans must disclose in advance of the refinancing or consolidation, any benefits or protections exclusive to federal student loans that may be lost as a result of the consolidation or refinancing.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f) (1)</b> A student loan servicer shall respond to a written inquiry from a student loan borrower, or the representative of a student loan borrower, within ten (10) business days after receipt of the request, and provide information relating to the request and, if applicable, the action the student loan servicer will take to correct the account or an explanation for the student loan servicer’s position that the borrower’s account is correct.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The ten-day (10) period described in subsection (f)(1) may be extended for not more than fifteen (15) days, if before the end of the ten-day (10) period the student loan servicer notifies the borrower or the borrower’s representative of the extension and the reasons for the delay in responding.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> After receipt of a written request related to a credit reporting dispute on a borrower’s payment on a student education loan, a student loan servicer shall not furnish adverse information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a payment that is the subject of the written inquiry.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> Except as provided by federal law or required by a student loan agreement, a student loan servicer shall inquire of a borrower how to apply an overpayment to a student education loan. A borrower’s direction on how to apply an overpayment to a student education loan shall stay in effect for any future overpayments during the term of a student education loan until the borrower provides different directions. For purposes of this section, “overpayment” means a payment on a student education loan in excess of the monthly amount due from a borrower on a student education loan, also commonly referred to as a prepayment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> Where a borrower has multiple loans at the same level of delinquency, a student loan servicer shall apply partial payments in a manner that minimizes late fees and negative credit reporting by applying such payments to satisfy as many individual loan payments as possible on a borrower’s account. For purposes of this section, “partial payment” means a payment on a student loan account that contains multiple individual loans in an amount less than the amount necessary to satisfy the outstanding payment due on all loans in the student loan account, also commonly referred to as an underpayment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> In the event of the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the servicing of a student education loan that results in a change in the identity of the person to whom a student loan borrower is required to send payments or direct any communication concerning the student education loan, the following provisions apply:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> As a condition of a sale, an assignment, or any other transfer of the servicing of a student education loan, a student loan lender shall require the new student loan servicer to honor all benefits originally represented as available to a student loan borrower during the repayment of the student education loan and preserve the availability of the benefits, including any benefits for which the student loan borrower has not yet qualified.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> A student loan servicer shall transfer to the new student loan servicer all records regarding the student loan borrower, the account of the student loan borrower, and the student education loan of the student loan borrower.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The records required under subsection (h)(2) shall include the repayment status of the student loan borrower and any benefits associated with the student education loan of the student loan borrower.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> The student loan servicer shall complete the transfer of records required under subsection (h)(2) within forty-five (45) days after the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the servicing of a student education loan.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> The parties shall notify all student loan borrowers impacted by the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the servicing of a student education loan at least seven (7) days before the next payment on the loan is due. Notice must include: The identity of the new loan holder and/or servicer; the effective date of the transfer; the date on which the old servicer will no longer accept payments; the date on which the new servicer will begin to accept payments; and contact and billing information for loan payments.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(j)</b> A student loan servicer that services a student education loan shall adopt policies and procedures to verify that the student loan servicer has received all records regarding the student loan borrower; the account of the student loan borrower; and the student education loan of the student loan borrower, including the repayment status of the student loan borrower and any benefits associated with the student education loan of the student loan borrower.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(k)</b> When a prior student loan servicer receives a payment intended for the new student loan servicer, the prior student loan servicer must promptly transfer the payment to the new servicer, along with the date the prior servicer received the payment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(l)</b> When a new servicer receives a payment from a prior servicer under subsection (j), the payment must be applied as of the date received by the prior servicer. A student loan servicer must implement processes and controls to ensure a student loan borrower does not incur additional interest, fees, or delinquency due to complications related to the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the servicing of a student education loan.</p>

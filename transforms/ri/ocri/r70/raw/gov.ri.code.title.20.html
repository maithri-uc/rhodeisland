<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The general assembly further finds that the management of fish and wildlife through the establishment of hunting and fishing seasons; the setting of size, catch, possession, and bag limits; the regulation of the manner of hunting and fishing; and the establishment of conservation policies should be pursued utilizing modern scientific techniques, having regard for the fluctuations of species populations, the effect of management practices on fish and wildlife, and the conservation and perpetuation of all species of fish and wildlife.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Federal Question Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Lobstermen’s challenge brought in state court challenging lobster-trap allocation regulations as a violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 20-2.1-9 required them to show (i) that the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management director mandated retroactive control dates, notwithstanding (ii) that retroactive control dates were not compulsory under federal law. Thus, it was not logically possible for them to prevail without affirmatively answering the embedded question of whether federal law, in the form of a fishery management plan promulgated under the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Compact, expressly required the use of retroactive control dates and therefore, the federal court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.S. § 1331. R.I. Fishermen's Alliance, Inc. v. R.I. Dep't of Envtl. Mgmt., 585 F.3d 42, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 23344 (1st Cir. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Powers.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management was entitled to summary judgment on the fishermen’s argument that R.I. Marine Fisheries Regulation 6.7-8(a) violated R.I. Gen. Laws § 20-2.1-9 because Rhode Island law did not grant the Director of DEM the power to create and/or transfer rights of access to the public marine resource; it was undisputed that no final regulation had been promulgated by DEM providing for the transferability of lobster trap allocations, and thus, the fishermen’s argument on that point was clearly premature. Rhode Island Fishermen's Alliance, Inc. v. Dep't of Envtl. Mgmt., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77887 (D.R.I. Oct. 3, 2008), aff'd, 585 F.3d 42, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 23344 (1st Cir. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Retroactive Control Dates.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management was entitled to summary judgment on the fishermen’s argument that the department acted contrary to R.I. Gen. Laws § 20-2.1-9(4)(ii) by adopting a regulatory scheme that used retroactive control dates to determine the allocation of lobster traps; since Rhode Island did not submit an alternative plan and the fishermen had not presented any evidence identifying a particular alternative plan, the fishermen failed to show that the hypothetical plan would have met the same fishing mortality target of Amendment 3 to the Interstate Fishery Management Plan for American Lobster as required as a result of Rhode Island’s membership in the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Compact.

<p class="p6">Whereas it is further recognized that the continued existence of this natural environment within Rhode Island is dependent upon the maintenance of a high order of diversity of life forms within that environment and is equally dependent upon the maintenance of sufficient and suitable natural habitat in which a diverse fauna and flora can reproduce, find food, shelter, and clean soil, water, and air and carry out those functions essential to sustain their existences; and</p>
<p class="p6">Whereas it is recognized that in addition to appropriate habitat, diversity and numbers of species and individuals in native faunal and floral populations is the key to maintaining a healthy, stable, and productive natural environment within which the citizens of Rhode Island can function; and</p>
<p class="p6">Whereas it is acknowledged that Rhode Island has a distinctive natural community of living things worthy of protection for its own sake and for the use and benefits of its people; and</p>
<p class="p6">Whereas it is further recognized that the existence of many individual species of animals and plants within Rhode Island has been, and may continue to be, threatened by the intentional and unintentional activities of humans in the course of their daily affairs:</p>
<p class="p6">It is hereby declared to be the intent of the state of Rhode Island, to provide a means by which “nongame wildlife” research and management may be financed through a voluntary checkoff of a portion of an income tax refund owed to a taxpayer by the state. It is also intended that funds generated by the checkoff be supplemental to any funds that would otherwise be available for the above purposes, and that the funds be used only for “nongame wildlife” research and management.</p>

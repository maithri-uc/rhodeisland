<p class="p6">No person shall conduct within this state any shellfish business until that person shall have obtained a license from the department. The director shall, upon receipt of application for a license to conduct a shellfish business, cause the applicant’s shellfish business facilities to be investigated and, if they are found to comply with the provisions of this chapter and the regulations adopted in accordance with this chapter, shall issue a license upon receipt of a fee for a shipper/reshipper or for a shucker packer/repacker as set forth in § 23-1-54. Any license issued shall apply only to those phases of the shellfish business that appear on the license and are defined by the director in regulations he or she shall adopt in regard to licensing. In order to set the license renewal dates so that all activities for each establishment can be combined on one license instead of on several licenses, the department of health shall set the license renewal date. The license period shall be for twelve (12) months, unless sooner suspended or revoked for cause, commencing on the license renewal date, and the license fee shall be at the full annual rate regardless of the date of application or the date of issuance of license. If the license renewal date is changed, the department may make an adjustment to the fees of licensed establishments, not to exceed the annual license fee, in order to implement the change in license renewal date. Licenses issued pursuant to this section may be suspended or revoked for violation of the provisions of this chapter or the regulations adopted in accordance with this chapter. The director may, after a hearing, refuse to issue any shellfish business license to any person who has been convicted of any violation of this chapter.</p>

Public Laws 1959, ch. 56, enacted the Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics Act as chapter 31, superseding, for the most part, chapter 1 but making no mention of such chapter 1. Public Laws 1963, ch. 164, then amended chapter 1 so as to change the subject matter of such chapter to relate to frozen food products.

If no substantial objections are received and no hearing is requested within thirty (30) days after publication of a notice of the adoption of a federal regulation, it shall be effective as of the date it was adopted by the federal government. If timely substantial objections are made to a federal regulation within thirty (30) days after it is automatically adopted, the director, after notice, shall conduct a public hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 35 of title 42.

<p class="p7"><b>Each Party to the Transaction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The phrase “each party to the transaction” conveys an unambiguous and reasonable meaning when read in relation to the persons described in the first two sentences of this section. State v. Udin, 419 A.2d 251, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1728 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The person giving an official written order and the person who accepts that order constitute “each party to the transaction” upon whom this section imposes a record-keeping requirement. State v. Udin, 419 A.2d 251, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1728 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The ultimate determination of whether a defendant is a “party to the transaction” depends upon resolution of the issue of whether he was the person giving the official written orders within the meaning of this section. State v. Udin, 419 A.2d 251, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1728 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The essential factual finding in connection with deciding who is a party to the transaction for purposes of this section depended, under the circumstances of this case, upon determining who was listed as the registrant on the order forms in issue. State v. Udin, 419 A.2d 251, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1728 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The registrant named on the order form is a party to the transaction required by this section to preserve copies of accepted orders. State v. Udin, 419 A.2d 251, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1728 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The person described in this section as the one giving an official written order is the person who is named as the registrant on each order form. State v. Udin, 419 A.2d 251, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1728 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Liability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A defendant’s liability under this section hinges on whether he was the registrant named on the order forms or, if he was not the registrant, whether he occupied a position in relation to the registrant by which position the registrant’s failure to preserve order forms would be imputed to him. State v. Udin, 419 A.2d 251, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1728 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Person Giving Orders.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The requirement in the second sentence of this section is imposed on the person giving the official written order. State v. Udin, 419 A.2d 251, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1728 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The language “person giving the order” must be construed narrowly because failure to comply with the record-keeping requirement of this section may under § 21-28-4.02 result in the imposition of penal sanctions. State v. Udin, 419 A.2d 251, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1728 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The first sentence of this section indicates that the person giving an official written order is, under this section, distinct from a duly authorized agent who signs the order. Thus, an agent who signs an order is not the person giving the order. State v. Udin, 419 A.2d 251, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1728 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When read in context the language, “person giving the order” clearly refers to a person giving an official written order, but it is of doubtful meaning and therefore is ambiguous. State v. Udin, 419 A.2d 251, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1728 (R.I. 1980).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Any person” as used in this section includes physicians, who are exempted from the penalties imposed under the Controlled Substances Act only when they are registered and acting within the scope of their registration or when they fall into another of those categories of persons otherwise exempted by § 21-28-3.30. State v. Mann, 119 R.I. 720, 382 A.2d 1319, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 609 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Entrapment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defense of entrapment requires a showing that the criminal conduct was the product of the creative activity of law-enforcement officials, and where it was shown by substantial, overwhelming evidence that the defendant was a willing and voluntary participant in the drug activities for which he was indicted, the State had not “manufactured” the crime and the defense of entrapment would not stand. State v. DeWolfe, 121 R.I. 676, 402 A.2d 740, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2047 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By raising the defense of entrapment, the defendant put in issue his predisposition to sell and possess drugs, and the state was entitled to show, by evidence of defendant’s voluntary participation in other drug sales, the state of mind of the defendant, and that the undercover drug operation had trapped an “unwary criminal,” not an “unwary innocent.” State v. DeWolfe, 121 R.I. 676, 402 A.2d 740, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2047 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the defendant introduces sufficient evidence of inducement to raise the question of entrapment but the state adduces no evidence of predisposition in rebuttal, the trial justice must find as a matter of law that entrapment has occurred. However, if the state introduces evidence of defendant’s predisposition, the jury must resolve the question of entrapment. State v. Jones, 416 A.2d 676, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1660 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Predisposition should be proven by reliable and probative evidence. For evidence to be reliable and probative, it must have a direct bearing on whether defendant was of a disposition that readily responds to inducement by government agents or informers at the time he was subjected to the inducement. State v. Jones, 416 A.2d 676, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1660 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although an undercover police officer supplied the money to purchase marijuana, where it was the defendant who first suggested purchasing drugs, who made the travel arrangements and the initial contact with the dealer, and who contracted for the purchase of marijuana, delivered the money to the dealer, and, after delivery, brought the undercover officer to see the marijuana, the police conduct was not so “outrageous” as to prove entrapment. State v. Pratt, 641 A.2d 732, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 161 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Testimony of a taxicab operator that defendant had left a jacket in his cab with drugs wrapped in it together with defendant’s admission to police of ownership of the jacket, although later denied, were sufficient to sustain defendant’s conviction of violation of possession or control law. State v. McCartin, 106 R.I. 674, 262 A.2d 826, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 973 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that nine of ten packets sold by defendant as containing heroin had not been analyzed, although the one analyzed was found to contain heroin, did not make it error to admit all ten of the packets in evidence. State v. Glass, 107 R.I. 86, 265 A.2d 324, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 742 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was not incumbent upon the state to prove the sale of ten glassine bags of heroin, because the bill of particulars gave the quantity sold as “ten glassine bags” where defendant was merely charged with the sale of “a narcotic drug, to wit: Heroin”. State v. Glass, 107 R.I. 96, 265 A.2d 324 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the offense charged was a felony, the ruling of district court granting motion to suppress evidence, followed by dismissal of complaint charging possession of cannabis (marijuana), was not binding in superior court proceedings after defendant was indicted for the same offense in view of statute vesting original jurisdiction over the offense in the superior court. State v. Conti, 110 R.I. 237, 291 A.2d 623, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 904 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where barbiturate pills were discovered on bucket seat occupied by defendant when he was ordered by police to get out of motor vehicle which was neither owned nor operated by him and there was no testimony that he knew of or exercised any possession over such drug, evidence was insufficient to sustain conviction. State v. Fortes, 110 R.I. 406, 293 A.2d 506, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 928 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was not error to exclude the testimony of an expert witness proffered for the purpose of rebutting the statutory classification of cannabis as a narcotic drug in an action filed for violation of possession law. State v. Bair, 111 R.I. 565, 305 A.2d 106, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1246 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where conviction for illegal possession of narcotics was based solely on evidence that the defendant was present in car found to contain marijuana, and there was no showing that defendant was in conscious possession of and exercised intentional control over the drug with knowledge of its nature, the conviction was reversed for insufficient evidence. State v. Olsen, 113 R.I. 164, 319 A.2d 27, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1154 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where marijuana was dropped from the pockets of one or both of two suspects prior to their questioning, and the evidence did not establish which one, or whether both, had possessed it, the court’s refusal to direct a verdict of acquittal was error, since the evidence of possession by the defendant was only speculative. State v. De Gregory, 113 R.I. 434, 322 A.2d 52, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1196 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the record contained no evidence, direct or otherwise, that the defendants, charged with offenses under this statute, consciously possessed or controlled the contraband articles found at the scene, their mere presence at the scene and subsequent flight upon the arrival of the police was not sufficient evidence to sustain their convictions. In re Caldarone, 115 R.I. 316, 345 A.2d 871, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1154 (1975).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where evidence failed to establish that police officer had seen marijuana in defendant’s automobile before he opened the car door, the marijuana was not admissible under the plain view doctrine, and conviction for violation of §§ 21-28-31 and 21-28-32 (now repealed) was overturned. State v. Marshall, 120 R.I. 306, 387 A.2d 1046, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 672 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a delivery of a controlled substance case, the testimony at trial indicated that a surveillance detective observed an exchange of cocaine for money between a buyer and defendant; later, the surveillance detective seized what tested to be cocaine from the buyer’s truck. Shortly thereafter, defendant was apprehended sitting in the same green car, parked in the same location as the purveyor of the suspected narcotics and made incriminating statements; with those facts in the record as a basis that defendant delivered a controlled substance, the trial justice was not clearly wrong did not overlook material evidence in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. State v. Castro, 891 A.2d 848, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 17 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, defendant’s counsel was not ineffective for not discovering that a toxicology report was erroneous; but, even if counsel were, defendant was not prejudiced, since a factual basis existed for defendant’s nolo contendere plea even in the absence of the report. Moniz v. State, 933 A.2d 691, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 100 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the record was replete with evidence that defendant knew there was cocaine in the bags that defendant tossed under a cooperating witness’s car and/or were seized from defendant’s automobile, and because the intent to deliver could be inferred from the quantity of cocaine seized, defendant was properly convicted of possessing cocaine with an intent to deliver; thus, defendant’s R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal was properly denied. State v. Rodriguez, 10 A.3d 431, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 116 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that an individual approached defendant in a rushed manner, handed him currency, and received something from defendant in return, and that the transaction took place in an area known for drug trafficking and the individual was apprehended minutes later with a small bag of cocaine in his pocket was sufficient to support a reasonable jury finding defendant guilty of delivery of a controlled substance, cocaine, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-28-4.01(a)(4)(i). State v. Vargas, 21 A.3d 347, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 89 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence Held Insufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s possession of 34.5 grams of cocaine was, without any other evidence, insufficient to meet the quantum of proof required to establish defendant’s intent to deliver. State v. Eiseman, 461 A.2d 369, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 961 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s convictions of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, possession of one ounce to one kilo of a controlled substance, and conspiracy to violate Rhode Island’s Uniform Controlled Substances Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 21, ch. 28, were vacated. As the evidence was insufficient to prove he knew of and intended to exercise control over cocaine found in his passengers’ purses, the evidence did not support the inference that he agreed with them to traffic in drugs. State v. Berroa, 6 A.3d 1095, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 102 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence Held Sufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s conviction for manufacturing and cultivating marijuana, R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-28-4.01(a)(1) and (4)(i), because testimony by a witness, who entered into a cooperation agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, placed defendant at various meetings where the operation and its profits were discussed, defendant participated in the planning and preparation for the grow operation at the rented property, received money from the witness for rent and equipment, managed the rent and utility payments while the operation was ongoing, and evidence seized from the rented property demonstrated defendant’s connection to the property; thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal, R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 29State v. Long, 61 A.3d 441, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 37 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence of Defendant’s Drug Dependency.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact of a defendant’s drug dependency or nondrug dependency is clearly not conduct proscribed by the statute and hence not an element of the res gestae. State v. Padula, 551 A.2d 687, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 146 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution under subsection (A), the state need not present any evidence that the defendant was not a drug dependant person. The fact of a defendant’s drug dependency or nondrug dependence is not an element of the offense proscribed by statute. State v. Mastracchio, 672 A.2d 438, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 42 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence of Firearms.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for possession of marijuana, the slight prejudicial effect of evidence of a loaded, semi-automatic weapon was outweighed by the probative value of the item. State v. Pratt, 641 A.2d 732, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 161 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Identity of Informant.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Affidavit based upon observations of defendant’s drug activities received from a nameless informer whose information in the past had resulted in several arrests was sufficient probable cause to justify issuance of search warrant. State v. Cannon, 110 R.I. 246, 292 A.2d 219, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 906 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was no abuse of discretion by the court in denying the defendant’s motion to disclose a confidential informant where the informant was a conduit of information rather than a principal or active participant in the crime charged. State v. Hernandez, 641 A.2d 62, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 141 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Indictment.</b></p>

State v. Gilman, 110 R.I. 207, 291 A.2d 425, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 902 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Information Upheld.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state properly charged a defendant by information with a violation of subsection (A)(2)(a) (now (a)(4)(i)), even though he could properly have been charged under subsection (A)(1) (now (a)(2)) as a nondrug-dependent person accused of selling schedule II controlled substance.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>First-degree felony murder convictions of defendants were reversed since the trial court erred by denying defendants’ motion for a judgment of acquittal; their proven attempt to acquire a large amount of a controlled substance ($43,000 worth), without some further act directed at delivery or distribution of the contraband, did not satisfy the substantial step required to constitute attempted distribution or delivery to support a conviction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1. R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-284.01(a)(1) criminalized possession with intent to manufacture or deliver, whereas R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1 omitted any reference to possession with intent to deliver and instead incorporated the language referring to a sale or other distribution, which was not the offense defendants’ felony-murder charge was predicated upon.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whereas subsection (A)(1) (now (a)(2)) of this section provides penalties for persons who manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to deliver schedule I or II controlled substances other than marijuana, subsection (A)(2) (now (a)(4)) provides penalties for all persons, excluding persons already provided for in subsection (A)(1) (now (a)(2)), who manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to deliver any schedule I or II controlled substance. There is no exception in subsection (A)(2) (now (a)(4)) for persons who manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to deliver marijuana. State v. Young, 519 A.2d 587, 1987 R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence showing that the total weight of marijuana in a barrel shipped from Jamaica to the defendant was 19.44 pounds, formed a sufficient basis from which the jury could find that the defendant intended to deliver the marijuana to others. State v. Colbert, 549 A.2d 1021, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 125 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>That 2,490 packets of heroin were found on a shelf in an open closet located in what was described as a “spare bedroom,” that other heroin-related paraphernalia was found in a kitchen cabinet amongst miscellaneous cooking utensils, that two twelve-gauge shotguns, ammunition, and $7,800 were found in a dead-bolted closet containing men’s, women’s, and children’s clothing, and that a safe-deposit box contained two gold rings and $1,250, were consistent with the inference of the sale of a controlled substance. State v. Hernandez, 641 A.2d 62, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 141 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Separate packaging of illegal narcotics was indicative of an intent to deliver, even though the marijuana found was separated and packaged in unequal amounts. State v. Williams, 656 A.2d 975, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that tends to show a defendant’s involvement in the probable sale of one type of illegal narcotic would give rise to an inference of an intent to sell all the drugs found in the defendant’s possession and would support a charge of possession with intent to deliver even a small amount of a drug. State v. Williams, 656 A.2d 975, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Despite the fact that a small amount of cocaine was found on defendant, the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal on charges of possession with intent to deliver cocaine and heroin, as the State presented evidence that the cocaine was individually packaged and that the buyer and defendant had an existing buyer-seller relationship that included the delivery of cocaine. State v. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 145, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 87 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal as he intended to deliver the cocaine found in his possession because a law enforcement officer testified that, on approximately 15 occasions in less than a two-month period, he had observed defendant visiting an apartment that had been under investigation for selling narcotics; the exhibits presented at trial included a digital scale, and nine clear plastic bags containing cocaine that had been seized from defendant’s residence; an expert witness testified that the total weight of the cocaine seized was 33.43 grams; and approximately $3,300 worth of cocaine was seized from defendant and his residence.

<p class="p7"><b>Knowledge.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since possession of an object involves the power to control and intent to control, knowledge of the nature of the object must necessarily precede the intent or the exercise of such control.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Possession of a proscribed substance can give rise to the inference that the possessor knows what he possesses, especially if it is in his hands, on his person, in his vehicle or on his premises. State v. Sundel, 121 R.I. 638, 402 A.2d 585, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2043 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for unlawful possession of controlled substances with intent to deliver them in violation of this section, where defendant did not deny that the drugs and narcotic paraphernalia were found in his house and there was uncontradicted testimony of one of the federal agents that defendant admitted that the controlled substances on the coffee table were for defendant’s own use, sufficient evidence was present from which reasonable inferences could be drawn that defendant had knowledge of the presence of the large quantity of controlled substances in his house, that the drugs belonged to him and that defendant intended to use the narcotic paraphernalia in the preparation and delivery of the drugs. State v. Sundel, 121 R.I. 638, 402 A.2d 585, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2043 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because possession of a controlled substance is a lesser-included offense of delivery, the mental state required to prove possession must be present in order to establish the offense of delivery. Thus, the state must prove that defendant had not only the power and intent to control but also a general knowledge of the nature of the substance possessed. State v.

<p class="p7"><b>Possession.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the defendant directed the co-occupant of a house to give bags of marijuana stored in the closet to the police, he had control of those bags with knowledge of their contents so as to constitute possession.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Proof of constructive possession of a controlled substance requires a showing that the defendant knew of the presence of the substance and that he intended to exercise control over it; these two elements can be inferred from a totality of the circumstances.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s presence in the car and his statements to the officer, the large quantity of heroin discovered, the relationship between the defendant and the driver of the car, their travel itinerary, and the physical evidence as it related to the car collectively gave rise to a strong inference that defendant traveled to New York with his girlfriend in order to assist her in transporting a large shipment of heroin back to Rhode Island. From the totality of the circumstances the jury could infer that defendant had constructively possessed the heroin even though the heroin was in the trunk and occupants had no key to the trunk.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for possession of marijuana, evidence of the defendant’s alleged cocaine involvement may have been prejudicial to the defendant; however, the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect where the defendant’s proposed means of obtaining the money to pay for the marijuana was through the sale of cocaine.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that defendant lived in an apartment where $250,000 worth of cocaine and drug sale paraphernalia was discovered in the bedroom where she slept and throughout the kitchen, was sufficient to support charges of possession of cocaine and possession with intent to deliver.

<p class="p7"><b>Probable Cause for Arrest.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The facts that the officer found defendant in possession of a brass pipe of a type used for the smoking of marijuana, his experience and training as a police officer as to offenses involving the use of drugs, and the report of an informant that boys were smoking marijuana in the place he found defendant were sufficient grounds to conclude that defendant had committed or was about to commit the crime with which he was charged and to furnish probable cause for arrest.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant, in a previous conviction, admitted to conspiring to violate the Rhode Island Uniform Controlled Substances Act by agreeing to possess, with intent to deliver, an amount of cocaine, the state conviction was a “serious drug offense” within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.S. § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) because the relationship between the inchoate offense of conspiracy and its object, its entire purpose, was plainly close enough that the conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute was, under the ACCA, an offense involving possessing with intent to distribute.

<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a delivery of a controlled substance case, the testimony at trial indicated that a surveillance detective observed an exchange of cocaine for money between a buyer and defendant; later, the surveillance detective seized what tested to be cocaine from the buyer’s truck. Shortly thereafter, defendant was apprehended sitting in the same green car, parked in the same location as the purveyor of the suspected narcotics and made incriminating statements; with those facts in the record as a basis that defendant delivered a controlled substance, the trial justice was not clearly wrong did not overlook material evidence in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. State v. Castro, 891 A.2d 848, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 17 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, defendant’s counsel was not ineffective for not discovering that a toxicology report was erroneous; but, even if counsel were, defendant was not prejudiced, since a factual basis existed for defendant’s nolo contendere plea even in the absence of the report. Moniz v. State, 933 A.2d 691, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 100 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the record was replete with evidence that defendant knew there was cocaine in the bags that defendant tossed under a cooperating witness’s car and/or were seized from defendant’s automobile, and because the intent to deliver could be inferred from the quantity of cocaine seized, defendant was properly convicted of possessing cocaine with an intent to deliver; thus, defendant’s R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal was properly denied. State v. Rodriguez, 10 A.3d 431, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 116 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that an individual approached defendant in a rushed manner, handed him currency, and received something from defendant in return, and that the transaction took place in an area known for drug trafficking and the individual was apprehended minutes later with a small bag of cocaine in his pocket was sufficient to support a reasonable jury finding defendant guilty of delivery of a controlled substance, cocaine, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-28-4.01(a)(4)(i). State v. Vargas, 21 A.3d 347, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 89 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence Held Insufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s convictions of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, possession of one ounce to one kilo of a controlled substance, and conspiracy to violate Rhode Island’s Uniform Controlled Substances Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 21, ch. 28, were vacated. As the evidence was insufficient to prove he knew of and intended to exercise control over cocaine found in his passengers’ purses, the evidence did not support the inference that he agreed with them to traffic in drugs. State v. Berroa, 6 A.3d 1095, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 102 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence Held Sufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s conviction for manufacturing and cultivating marijuana, R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-28-4.01(a)(1) and (4)(i), because testimony by a witness, who entered into a cooperation agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, placed defendant at various meetings where the operation and its profits were discussed, defendant participated in the planning and preparation for the grow operation at the rented property, received money from the witness for rent and equipment, managed the rent and utility payments while the operation was ongoing, and evidence seized from the rented property demonstrated defendant’s connection to the property; thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal, R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 29State v. Long, 61 A.3d 441, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 37 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>First-degree felony murder convictions of defendants were reversed since the trial court erred by denying defendants’ motion for a judgment of acquittal; their proven attempt to acquire a large amount of a controlled substance ($43,000 worth), without some further act directed at delivery or distribution of the contraband, did not satisfy the substantial step required to constitute attempted distribution or delivery to support a conviction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1. R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-284.01(a)(1) criminalized possession with intent to manufacture or deliver, whereas R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1 omitted any reference to possession with intent to deliver and instead incorporated the language referring to a sale or other distribution, which was not the offense defendants’ felony-murder charge was predicated upon. State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 161 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-28-4.01(a)(1), the crime of possession with intent to manufacture or deliver is a separate and distinct offense from the manufacture or delivery of a controlled substance. State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 161 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Intent to Deliver.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Despite the fact that a small amount of cocaine was found on defendant, the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal on charges of possession with intent to deliver cocaine and heroin, as the State presented evidence that the cocaine was individually packaged and that the buyer and defendant had an existing buyer-seller relationship that included the delivery of cocaine. State v. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 145, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 87 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal as he intended to deliver the cocaine found in his possession because a law enforcement officer testified that, on approximately 15 occasions in less than a two-month period, he had observed defendant visiting an apartment that had been under investigation for selling narcotics; the exhibits presented at trial included a digital scale, and nine clear plastic bags containing cocaine that had been seized from defendant’s residence; an expert witness testified that the total weight of the cocaine seized was 33.43 grams; and approximately $3,300 worth of cocaine was seized from defendant and his residence. State v. Maria, 132 A.3d 694, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 30 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Possession.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that defendant lived in an apartment where $250,000 worth of cocaine and drug sale paraphernalia was discovered in the bedroom where she slept and throughout the kitchen, was sufficient to support charges of possession of cocaine and possession with intent to deliver. State v. Portes, 840 A.2d 1131, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 13 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Relationship to Federal Laws.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant, in a previous conviction, admitted to conspiring to violate the Rhode Island Uniform Controlled Substances Act by agreeing to possess, with intent to deliver, an amount of cocaine, the state conviction was a “serious drug offense” within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.S. § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) because the relationship between the inchoate offense of conspiracy and its object, its entire purpose, was plainly close enough that the conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute was, under the ACCA, an offense involving possessing with intent to distribute. United States v. McKenney, 450 F.3d 39, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 14073 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1011, 127 S. Ct. 537, 166 L. Ed. 2d 398, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 8290 (2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a case in which a lawful permanent resident appealed his order of removal, his convictions for violating R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-28-4.01(a)(4)(i) clearly related to a controlled substance just as 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) required. Swaby v. Yates, 847 F.3d 62, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 1621 (1st Cir. 2017).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Common Nuisance.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The term “common nuisance” as used in this section requires a showing of more than an isolated instance of the prohibited activity. State v. Reis, 430 A.2d 749, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1163 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Legislature intended the words “common nuisance” as used in subsection (2)(a) (now (b)(1)) to have their common-law meaning and such meaning contemplates acts which are recurrent or of an habitual nature. State v. Reis, 430 A.2d 749, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1163 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence Held Sufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the record contained no evidence, direct or otherwise, that the defendants, charged with offenses under this statute, consciously possessed or controlled the contraband articles found at the scene, their mere presence at the scene and subsequent flight upon the arrival of the police was not sufficient evidence to sustain their convictions. In re Caldarone, 115 R.I. 316, 345 A.2d 871, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1154 (1975).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence of defendant’s return to apartment in which he had previously been seen passing around a cigarette resembling a marijuana cigarette was insufficient to sustain a conviction. State v. Boily, 116 R.I. 37, 351 A.2d 818, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1240 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where police officer went to apartment to purchase narcotics, and while there, saw defendant smoking what he believed to be a marijuana cigarette and such cigarette was being passed among several persons and defendant could have heard police officer state that he was there to purchase narcotics and defendant stated that he had been at apartment before, there was sufficient evidence from which it could be inferred that defendant knowingly violated subsection (1)(c) (now (b)(3)) of this section. State v. De Simas, 122 R.I. 420, 408 A.2d 603, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1556 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where state was able to establish only that a single sale had occurred at the defendant’s residence, moreover, that transaction involved marijuana, whereas in this information the nuisance involved the sale and possession of LSD and amphetamines, such evidence was legally insufficient to sustain the charge of maintaining a narcotics nuisance. State v. Bulhoes, 430 A.2d 1274, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1178 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Newly Discovered Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Newly discovered evidence might in fact have affected the verdict, but because it was merely impeaching evidence of a witness who testified against defendant, it would not entitle defendant to a new trial. State v. Vendetti, 655 A.2d 686, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 59 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Proof Required.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Defenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defense of voluntary intoxication, which is only applicable to negate the intent element in specific intent crimes, is not available in a prosecution for either possession or delivery of a controlled substance. Sharbuno v. Moran, 429 A.2d 1294, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1151 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Felony Murder.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The delivery of a controlled substance to a child without the direction of a physician in regard to dosage is an act that is inherently dangerous warranting a conviction under the felony murder doctrine if the delivery results in the death of the child. State v. Taylor, 626 A.2d 201, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 164 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Knowledge or Intent Required.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Neither possession nor delivery of a controlled substance is a specific-intent crime. Sharbuno v. Moran, 429 A.2d 1294, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1151 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mental state required to prove possession must also be present to make out the offense of delivery under subsection (A) of this section. Sharbuno v. Moran, 429 A.2d 1294, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1151 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the lesser included offense of possession of a controlled substance requires guilty knowledge of “conscious possession”, a conviction on an indictment charging delivery of the controlled substance also requires proof of such a general intent. Sharbuno v. Moran, 429 A.2d 1294, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1151 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This subsection establishes a strict liability standard of guilt for administering or giving a controlled substance and no specific intent need be shown. Thus a mother who had given methadone to her daughter was criminally liable under this statute. State v. Taylor, 623 A.2d 453, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 107 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Lesser Included Offenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The offense of simple possession of a controlled substance in violation of G.L. 1956 (1968 Reenactment) § 21-28-4.01(C) is a lesser included offense of delivery of a controlled substance under subsection (A) of this section. Sharbuno v. Moran, 429 A.2d 1294, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1151 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Multiple Counts.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a charge of selling drugs to a minor offered great potential for prejudice when it was tried simultaneously with other counts, in light of overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt, defendant suffered no “real prejudice.” State v. Sharbuno, 120 R.I. 714, 390 A.2d 915, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 721 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When there is clear evidence that a defendant has possession and control of a substantial cache of drugs from which he delivers quantities in a series of sales or transfers, he clearly could be tried and sentenced for both possession and delivery. State v. Ahmadjian, 438 A.2d 1070, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1423 (R.I. 1981).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Elements of Conspiracy.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the evidence demonstrated that defendant was charged with conspiring with the individual to deliver cocaine to the detective, the conspiratorial agreement was a distinct and chargeable offense from the delivery count; thus, the trial court properly denied the motion for acquittal.

<p class="p7"><b>Relationship to Federal Laws.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant, in a previous conviction, admitted to conspiring to violate the Rhode Island Uniform Controlled Substances Act by agreeing to possess, with intent to deliver, an amount of cocaine, the state conviction was a “serious drug offense” within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) because the relationship between the inchoate offense of conspiracy and its object, its entire purpose, was plainly close enough that the conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute was, under the ACCA, an offense involving possessing with intent to distribute. United States v. McKenney, 450 F.3d 39, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 14073 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1011, 127 S. Ct. 537, 166 L. Ed. 2d 398, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 8290 (2006).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> There is a substantial probability that the state will prevail on the issue of forfeiture and that failure to enter the order will result in the property being destroyed, conveyed, encumbered or further encumbered, removed from the jurisdiction of the court, or made unavailable for forfeitures; and</p>

The temporary restraining order shall expire within ten (10) days of the date on which it is entered unless extended for good cause shown or unless the party against whom it is entered consents to an extension for a longer period.</p>

Following the entry of an order declaring the property forfeited, the court may, upon application of the attorney general, enter any appropriate restraining orders or injunctions, require the execution of satisfactory performance bonds, appoint receivers, conservators, appraisers, accountants, or trustees, or take any other action to protect the interest of the state in the property ordered forfeited. Any income accruing to or derived from an enterprise or an interest in an enterprise that has been ordered forfeited under this section may be used to offset ordinary and necessary expenses of the enterprise as required by law or that are necessary to protect the interest of the state or innocent third parties.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An attempt to collect property through civil forfeiture proceedings must be remedial; the state cannot collect a sum or compel forfeiture of an object whose value exceeds the remedial limit. In considering the amount that might be within the remedial limit, the trial court may consider the cost of apprehending and prosecuting each individual defendant as well as the cost in these cases of probationary supervision during the terms of probation imposed. The state may not consider the cost of combating the drug traffic as a whole but only those costs that relate to the particular case at issue. State v. One Lot of $8,560 in United States Currrency, 670 A.2d 772, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 25 (R.I. 1996), overruled, State v. One 1990 Chevrolet Corvette, 695 A.2d 502, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 201 (R.I. 1997).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant’s arrest has not led to conviction on any charge, and the city has failed to show that there are any indictments pending against him that directly involve the seized funds, the city has not established a substantial and instrumental relationship between the money seized and illegal behavior by a preponderance of the evidence.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that defendant was observed knocking on the door of a motel room in which illegal drugs had recently been confiscated is simply not sufficient evidence to support the city’s conclusion that “defendant was linked to a large scale marijuana smuggling operation and the large amounts of money he was carrying had been used or were to be used in the purchase or sale of a controlled substance”.

<p class="p6">A justice of the family court or a judge of the district court may certify a narcotic addict to the care and custody of the department in the following manner:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Except as provided in this section, whenever any narcotic addict desires to obtain treatment for his or her addiction, whenever a related individual has reason to believe that any person is a narcotic addict, or whenever the director of health has reason to believe that any person is a narcotic addict, the addict, related individual, or director of health may apply for an order certifying that person to the care and custody of the department by presenting a verified petition setting forth knowledge, information, or belief that the person is a narcotic addict, together with a statement of the facts upon which that knowledge, information, or belief is based. When the petition is presented, the court may examine the petitioner, or any witness, under oath and shall determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person in whose behalf the application is made is a narcotic addict. If the court determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person is a narcotic addict, and if the person is not also the petitioner, it shall issue an order in accordance with subdivision (2) of this section; provided, that if the court determines that the person would not comply with the order the court shall issue, in lieu of an order, a warrant in accordance with subdivision (3) of this section. When the alleged addict is the petitioner and the court determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person is a narcotic addict, the court shall immediately proceed in accordance with subdivision (4) of this section. The state shall be a party in all proceedings pursuant to this section and shall act on the relation of the petitioner. The attorney general shall represent the state.</p>

The court shall direct that the order and petition be served upon the alleged narcotic addict personally or by registered mail and the court may direct that the order and petition be served personally or by mail upon the husband or wife, father or mother, or next of kin of the alleged narcotic addict.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> A warrant issued pursuant to this section shall be directed to any police officer in the state commanding the officer: (i) to take the alleged narcotic addict into custody, and (ii) to immediately bring the alleged narcotic addict before the court for a determination whether there are reasonable grounds to order him or her to undergo a medical examination at a facility designated by the department. If the court is not then in session, the alleged narcotic addict may be held at a facility designated by the department or at any other detention facility until the court is in session. In this case, the head of the facility or a duly appointed representative shall advise the alleged addict of the nature of the proceeding, the reason for his or her detention, and that he or she will appear before a judge at the next court session in connection with the allegation that he or she is a narcotic addict. This person shall also inform the alleged addict that he or she has the right to the aid of counsel at every stage of the proceedings, and that if the person desires the aid of counsel and is financially unable to obtain counsel, counsel shall be assigned by the court, and that he or she is entitled to communicate free of charge, by telephone or letter, in order to obtain counsel and in order to inform a relative or friend of the proceeding. The warrant may be executed on any day including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays and the alleged narcotic addict shall not be subjected to any more restraint than is necessary for the purposes specified in the warrant. The police officer shall exhibit the warrant to the alleged narcotic addict, and inform the alleged addict of the purpose for which he or she is being taken into custody. The officer shall not break open any outer or inner door or window of a building, or any part of the building, or anything in a building, to execute the warrant unless, if after notice of the officer’s authority and purpose, he or she is refused admittance.

The court shall then advise the alleged narcotic addict that if the medical examination is ordered the alleged addict shall appear before the court after the examination as provided in paragraph (5)(i) of this section, and, if the petition and the report of the medical examination set forth reasonable grounds to believe that the person is a narcotic addict, he or she may after this be certified to the care and custody of the department for an indefinite period not exceeding three (3) years and that he or she shall have a right to a hearing prior to the certification. If the alleged narcotic addict appears without counsel, the court shall advise the person that he or she has the right to the aid of counsel at every stage of the proceedings, and that if he or she desires the aid of counsel and is financially unable to obtain counsel, then counsel shall be assigned. The court shall allow the alleged narcotic addict a reasonable time to send for counsel and shall adjourn the proceedings for that purpose.

<p class="p6">The general assembly finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Modern medical research has discovered beneficial uses for marijuana in treating or alleviating pain, nausea, and other symptoms associated with certain debilitating medical conditions, as found by the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine in March 1999.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, ninety-nine (99) out of every one hundred (100) marijuana arrests in the United States are made under state law, rather than under federal law. Consequently, changing state law will have the practical effect of protecting from arrest the vast majority of seriously ill people who have a medical need to use marijuana.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Although federal law currently prohibits any use of marijuana, the laws of Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington permit the medical use and cultivation of marijuana. Rhode Island joins in this effort for the health and welfare of its citizens.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> States are not required to enforce federal law or prosecute people for engaging in activities prohibited by federal law. Therefore, compliance with this chapter does not put the state of Rhode Island in violation of federal law.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> State law should make a distinction between the medical and nonmedical use of marijuana. Hence, the purpose of this chapter is to protect patients with debilitating medical conditions, and their physicians and primary caregivers, from arrest and prosecution, criminal and other penalties, and property forfeiture if such patients engage in the medical use of marijuana.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> The general assembly enacts this chapter pursuant to its police power to enact legislation for the protection of the health of its citizens, as reserved to the state in the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> It is in the state’s interests of public safety, public welfare, and the integrity of the medical marijuana program to ensure that the possession and cultivation of marijuana for the sole purpose of medical use for alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions is adequately regulated.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(8)</b> The goal of the medical marijuana program is to create a system that is transparent, safe, and responsive to the needs of patients. Consequently, the medical marijuana program requires regulation and a comprehensive regulatory structure that allows for oversight over all suppliers of medical marijuana while ensuring both safety and patient access.</p>

<p class="p6">It is found that the state of Rhode Island is in need of a regulatory format for the sale of home food service plans to ensure that consumers receive straightforward and informative disclosure as to the identity, quantity, weight and price of their purchase, while also assuring that those within the industry have a clear understanding of what they are required to disclose to a consumer. Disclosure by a simple one page written agreement which shows the price of the food and nonfood items, the price of the service charge and the total price of the plan, along with the document disclosing both a unit price and the item price should provide the consumer with significant and useful information. That information will permit consumers to judge whether or not the price of the food offered for sale is what they want to pay, whether the cost of the services associated with the plan is what they want to pay and whether the total price of the plan is what they want to pay, and thus allow for an informed consumer value decision to be made.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Caffeine is a known alkaloid found in cocoa, coffee, tea, kola nuts, and is naturally present in more than sixty (60) plants. While generally used as a stimulant, it does not actually provide energy, but on the contrary, provides the illusion of energy. While caffeine can be found naturally, powdered caffeine is manufactured in a laboratory setting, and if used in small doses, can be used safely to caffeinate medicines, food, and soft drinks. When used in high doses however, caffeine can raise the user’s blood pressure, cause heartburn, dehydration, and can lead to seizures, erratic heartbeats, and in some cases, death.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Currently, powdered caffeine is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the health and safety of the consumers, particularly minors, by regulating the sale, possession, and use of powdered caffeine within the state of Rhode Island.</p>

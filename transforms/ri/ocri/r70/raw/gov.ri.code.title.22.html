<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>P.L. 2002, ch. 4, § 8, provides: “The senatorial committees of the senatorial districts and the district committees of the representative districts in office on the effective date of this act shall not thereafter exercise any powers of nomination or endorsement of candidates for senator or representative, except for an election for senator or representative prior to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, 2002, but the chairperson of the state committee of each political party, forthwith upon passage of this act shall appoint the members of a senatorial district committee for each senatorial district and the members of a representative district committee for each representative district. Each of said senatorial district committees shall consist of five (5) members except that in senatorial districts which include all or parts of two (2) or more cities or towns, the committee shall consist of seven (7) members. Each of said representative district committees shall consist of three (3) members, except that in representative districts which include all or parts of two (2) or more cities and towns, the committee shall consist of five (5) members. Such district committee members, so appointed, shall hold office until the primary elections in 2002 and thereafter until their successors shall have been duly elected, qualified and organized. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to vacate the office or terminate the term of office of any state committee member of any party prior to the party primary election in September, 2002.”</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>P.L. 2002, ch. 4, § 9, provides: “Wherever in the general laws or in any public law a duty is imposed upon the president of a town council or upon the local board of any city or town or upon a town clerk, town sergeant or constable in connection with the election of a senator or representative, such duty in the case of a senatorial or representative district comprising parts or the whole of more than one (1) town shall be deemed to be imposed upon the president of the town council or local board or town clerk, town sergeant or constable of each or all of the towns in which such senatorial or representative district shall lie. Wherever in the general laws or in any public law a duty is imposed upon the city committee, town committee, or ward committee of a political party in connection with the election of a senator or representative, such duty shall be deemed to be imposed upon the senatorial or representative district committee of the party as the context shall require.”</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>P.L. 2002, ch. 4, § 11, provides: “This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes thereof and to apportion the state into senatorial or representative districts in compliance with the requirements of the United States Constitution. It is intended that the senatorial or representative districts described herein completely encompass all the area within the state and contain all the population residing in the state. It is further intended that the apportionment and districting provided for in this act results in the creation of districts containing substantially equal population. It is also intended that no senatorial or representative district shall include any of the area included within the description of any other senatorial or representative district. If the districts described in this act do not carry out the purposes thereof because of patent unintentional omissions, duplications, overlapping area, erroneous nomenclature, faulty description of boundary lines, street closings, changes in names of streets or of public places, alteration of the courses of rivers or streams, the filling in of lands under water or changes in shorelines due to accretion, the secretary of state is hereby authorized and empowered to correct such omissions, overlaps, erroneous nomenclature, or other defects in the description of districts so as to accomplish the purposes and objectives of this act. In making such corrections, the secretary of state shall be guided by the following standards:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(1) gaps in the description of any district shall be completed in a manner which results in a total description of the district in manner consonant with the description of adjacent districts;</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(3) areas not included within the descriptions of any district shall be allocated to the adjacent district having the lowest population.”</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>P.L. 2002, ch. 4, § 13, provides: “This act shall take effect upon its passage [February 20, 2002]; provided, however, that the provisions hereof shall first be effective in connection with elections to be held on or subsequent to the first day of September, 2002, and for the purpose of greater clarity, the first election under the provisions of this act for congress, senator and representative from each of the senatorial, congressional or representative districts hereby created, shall be held on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November, 2002, and the first primary election under the provisions of this act for nomination of candidates for congress, senator and for representative from each of said representative district shall be held on the second Tuesday after the first Monday in September, 2002, provided, however, that if any provision of this act or the application of such provision to any person or under any circumstances shall be held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid or inoperative by a decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, or if any action performed or to be performed under any provision of this act is restrained or enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this act shall not be deemed to be impaired or affected thereby but shall be deemed to remain in full force and effect. Any primary or special election held prior to the first day of September, 2002, shall be conducted under the laws as they existed prior to the passage of this act.”</p>

The auditor general’s review may include an assessment of system vulnerability, network penetration, potential security breaches, and susceptibility to cyber attack and cyber fraud.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Advantageous.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The term “advantageous”, as used in this section, should be equated with the standard that the acquired land be reasonably required for a public purpose. O'Neill v. East Providence, 480 A.2d 1375, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 593 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a city or town undergoes condemnation proceedings because acquisition of the property in question is advantageous to a highway-development scheme, such a taking is a constitutional exercise of the power of eminent domain. O'Neill v. East Providence, 480 A.2d 1375, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 593 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>City Charter.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where city charter provisions for condemnation differed from those in this chapter, this chapter governed and city council acted properly in following this chapter’s procedures and not the city charter provisions. O'Neill v. East Providence, 480 A.2d 1375, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 593 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Existing Highways.</b></p>

Watson v. Town Council of S. Kingstown, 5 R.I. 562, 1859 R.I. LEXIS 54 (1859).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Necessity.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Determination that public convenience requires highway is equivalent to finding of necessity and no finding of absolute necessity is required. Hunter v. Newport, 5 R.I. 325, 1858 R.I. LEXIS 39 (1858).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Necessary” means “reasonably necessary” with the cost as well as the benefit being considered. Hazard v. Town Council of Middletown, 12 R.I. 227, 1878 R.I. LEXIS 69 (1878).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Preliminary finding of necessity need not specify the width of the highway required. Boston &amp; P. R. Corp. v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Absolute necessity is not required in eminent-domain proceedings. Rather, the appropriate standard to be applied is whether the land taken is reasonably required for a public purpose. O'Neill v. East Providence, 480 A.2d 1375, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 593 (R.I. 1984).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Construction With Other Statutes.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because § 24-5-1.1 provides no standards for the repair or restoration of street excavations, it is clear that the legislature intended that the obligatory restoration by private excavators be regulated under the care and direction of the town council through ordinances and rules that municipalities were authorized to promulgate under § 24-5-1. In re Ordinance Adopted by the City of Providence, 745 A.2d 769, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 32 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Cities.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This statute applies to cities. Eaton v. Follett, 48 R.I. 189, 136 A. 437, 1927 R.I. LEXIS 40 (1927).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Portion of Highway Covered.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Duty of maintenance with respect to a bridge on town boundary extended only to that portion of the bridge within the town. Haley v. Calef, 28 R.I. 332, 67 A. 323, 1907 R.I. LEXIS 47 (1907).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>City could contract for and, as against contractor, was liable for cost of paving portion of street for which street railway company was responsible under § 39-8-8. Warren Bros. Co. v. Taylor, 29 R.I. 96, 69 A. 303, 1908 R.I. LEXIS 23 (1908).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Duty under this section extends to sidewalks along state highways.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But see Pullen v. State, 1998 (legislature clearly intended, by enacting §§ 24-8-6 and 24-8-9, to provide state authority to enter into contracts regarding construction and maintenance of sidewalks and to fix the responsibilities of the state and municipalities in regard to the same). Child v. Greene, 51 R.I. 477, 155 A. 664, 1931 R.I. LEXIS 87 (1931).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section requires towns to maintain their highways in full, including the sidewalks. Barroso v. Pepin, 106 R.I. 502, 261 A.2d 277 (1970). See also § 24-5-13, which abrogates the doctrine of municipal immunity.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, a later-enacted special provision that applies only to employees of the legislative branch, takes precedence over § 36-4-59, a conflicting, earlier-enacted statute of general application covering all state employees. Gibbons v. State, 694 A.2d 664, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 130 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsections (a) and (c) (now see (f) and (i)) of § 31-1-23 in defining highway and roadway contemplate that a highway is wider than a roadway and includes the “entire width” between the boundary lines of the public way, including the sidewalk, berm, or shoulder; it therefore follows that if the vegetation obstructing the view of the motorist in the accident was located on the town’s property and within the boundary lines of the highway, then the town was under a duty to keep this portion of the highway “safe and convenient for travelers” pursuant to this section. O'Gara v. Ferrante, 690 A.2d 1354, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 80 (R.I. 1997).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Town was liable for purchase made by state employee acting on behalf of town’s agent in procuring material for a project falling within the town’s duty under this section. Coutu Lumber Co. v. Coffin, 59 R.I. 125, 194 A. 715, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 146 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Town could not delegate to zoning board power to permit installation of gasoline pumps on the sidewalk. Di Palma v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 72 R.I. 286, 50 A.2d 779, 1947 R.I. LEXIS 3 (1947).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Duty of Supervision.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>City had duty to supervise independent contractor to avoid unreasonable delays in removal of obstructions made necessary by sewer project. Williams Bros. v. Tripp, 11 R.I. 447, 1877 R.I. LEXIS 22 (1877).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Town had duty to supervise work of independent contractor to insure that excavations were properly filled. Eaton v. Follett, 48 R.I. 189, 136 A. 437, 1927 R.I. LEXIS 40 (1927).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Duty to Maintain Driftway.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the language found in the enactment equates driftways with highways, a city has and has always had a duty to maintain its driftway; thus, city’s assertion that because this section expressly mentions “causeways, highways, and bridges” as falling within a town’s maintenance obligations, the omission of the word “driftway” eliminates all maintenance obligations of the town with regard to this type of right-of-way was without merit. O'Reilly v. Glocester, 621 A.2d 697, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 64 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Duty to Maintain Sidewalks.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sections 24-8-6 and 24-8-9 give the state authority to enter into contracts to construct and maintain sidewalks along state roadways; consequently, the state’s execution of a construction and maintenance agreement with a city in which the state<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>unequivocally agreed to maintain a sidewalk divested the city of any duty of maintenance and the city owed no duty to keep the sidewalk safe for pedestrian travel. Pullen v. State, 707 A.2d 686, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 25 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff’s suit against a town alleging she was injured due to a defective sidewalk was properly dismissed on summary judgment; as the description provided in her notice of claim excluded the actual area where the injury occurred, the notice did not fix the location in a reasonably sufficient manner under<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-15-9. Carbone v. Ward, 56 A.3d 442, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 151 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence of Negligence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence of circular depression in middle of street, measuring 16 inches in diameter, sloping toward center, and three inches deep at center, was not sufficient to take question of negligence to jury. Patalano v. Cray, 49 R.I. 15, 139 A. 471, 1927 R.I. LEXIS 6 (1927).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A difference in elevation of one and one-fourth inches between adjoining blocks in a sidewalk raised a question of fact as to the duty of the town. Quinn v. Stedman, 50 R.I. 153, 146 A. 618, 1929 R.I. LEXIS 35 (1929).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence, uncontradicted by town, that a series of large holes had existed in the street for as long as three years prior to the accident in which the nine-year-old bike rider was injured sufficiently presented the question of negligence on the part of the town as a question of fact properly within the function of the jury to decide. Ferretti v. Berry, 96 R.I. 67, 189 A.2d 344, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 50 (1963).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Existence of Highway.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No appeal lies from an order under this section to open a highway but landowner who contests the existence of a highway has remedy in trespass quare clausum fregit. Knowles v. District of Narragansett, 23 R.I. 339, 50 A. 386, 1901 R.I. LEXIS 142 (1901).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence of petition for repair of road and of council action thereon was admissible on the issue of the existence of a public highway. Cole v. Barber, 33 R.I. 414, 82 A. 129, 1912 R.I. LEXIS 97 (1912).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Laches.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Laches did not operate as a defense to plaintiffs-landowners’ lawsuit to compel town to open and repair a right-of-way where, although plaintiffs may have been negligent in failing to assert their rights sooner, the town was equally negligent in failing to fulfill its statutory obligation to maintain the right-of-way, and any prejudice the town suffered by repairing this driftway was prejudice occasioned by its own failure to act. O'Reilly v. Glocester, 621 A.2d 697, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 64 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Notice of Defect.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice to a member of a town council of a defect in a highway was not notice to the town. Jordan v. Peckham, 19 R.I. 28, 31 A. 305, 1895 R.I. LEXIS 22 (1895).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Knowledge by the surveyor as to road defects is notice to the town. Seamons v. Fitts, 20 R.I. 443, 40 A. 3, 1898 R.I. LEXIS 86 (1898); Seamons v. Fitts, 21 R.I. 236, 42 A. 863, 1899 R.I. LEXIS 15 (1899).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Surveyor who knew of excavation was bound to see to it that excavation was properly filled. Seamons v. Fitts, 20 R.I. 443, 40 A. 3, 1898 R.I. LEXIS 86 (1898); Seamons v. Fitts, 21 R.I. 236, 42 A. 863, 1899 R.I. LEXIS 15 (1899).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because a municipality’s obligation to maintain its highways and bridges constitutes a governmental function, claims alleging failure or negligent performance of this function are subject to the 60-day notice requirement. Mercado v. City of Providence, 770 A.2d 445, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 114 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because R.I. Gen. Laws § 24-5-1 did not absolve the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (DOT) of the duty to keep roadways safe from the dangers presented by parallel-bar sewer grates, the trial court erred in granting the DOT’s motion for judgment as a matter of law where the DOT had notice 15 years earlier that parallel-bar sewer grates were dangerous to bicycles. Tedesco v. Connors, 871 A.2d 920, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 73 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Scope of Statute.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The city did not owe the plaintiff a duty with respect to the condition of a street which had been abandoned and was now a private way, even though the city had posted a “Not a Through Street” sign instead of a “Not a Public Way” sign at its entrance. Di Cenzo v. Ruscetta, 510 A.2d 417, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 482 (R.I. 1986).</p>

Accordingly, the director is authorized to regulate direct vehicle access to state roads in situations whereby access may reasonably tend to affect the safe condition and integrity of state roads. This includes the authority to regulate the type, location, and width of roadways and driveways at their intersection with state highways and the authority to regulate construction within state highway right-of-ways.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Requests for access must be made in writing to the director, the local planning board and the chief elected or appointed official in a city or town at the same time and in a manner prescribed by the director.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> <b>Legislative findings.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The general assembly finds as follows:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> That all users of any tolled projects should be required to timely pay for the use of such projects;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> That toll violators and toll evaders unfairly shift the financial burden of maintaining the tolled projects to other project users; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Rhode Island has a strong interest in ensuring that its transportation infrastructure is adequately funded in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> In each instance when a person fails or refuses to pay or prepay the required toll on a tolled project, and is issued a violation for the same, the toll violator shall pay the toll amount within fourteen (14) days of issuance of the violation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Any toll violator who fails to pay the toll amount due within the fourteen-day (14) period in subsection (b) shall immediately incur a forty-dollar ($40.00) administrative fee in addition to the unpaid toll amount.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Any toll violator who fails to pay the administrative fee and unpaid toll as required by subsection (c) within forty-five (45) days of the issuance of the original violation, shall incur a thirty five-dollar ($35.00) administrative fee in addition to the forty dollar ($40.00) administrative fee and the unpaid toll amount. The toll amount and administrative fees shall be paid to the authority.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Toll evaders shall be responsible for any tolls and administrative fees applicable to toll violators. Further, at the request of the authority, any toll evader shall also promptly receive a traffic violation summons that shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Rhode Island traffic tribunal, which may suspend the toll evader’s driver’s license for up to six (6) months for the violations and assess a fine of up to five hundred dollars ($500), or both. All tolls, administrative fees, and fines shall be payable to the authority.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> If any unpaid toll amounts, administrative fees, and fines are not paid within ninety (90) days of the issuance of the original violation, and the toll violator has incurred at least ten (10) instances in which such toll violator has failed to pay any required toll amounts, administrative fees, and fines, then the authority may report the person as a toll violator, or, if appropriate, as a toll evader, to the Rhode Island division of motor vehicles, who then shall not permit that person to renew his or her driver’s license and vehicle registration until any unpaid toll amounts, administrative fees, and fines are paid to the authority. Upon the authority’s receipt of such payment or a written repayment agreement between the person and the authority, the authority shall promptly issue a verbal, written, or electric confirmation showing the amounts paid and a certification that the person does not owe any amounts to the authority or has otherwise made satisfactory repayment arrangements with the authority. In any such case, the Rhode Island division of motor vehicles shall forthwith release any hold placed for this purpose on the person’s license renewal and vehicle registration renewal. If a person who made satisfactory repayment arrangements with the authority subsequently fails to honor and comply with such arrangements with the authority according to their terms, the authority may re-report the person to the Rhode Island division of motor vehicles which shall then prohibit that person from renewing their driver’s license and vehicle registration until the originally unpaid toll amounts, administrative fees, and fines are paid to the authority.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> “Toll violator” means, for the purposes of this section, any person who uses any project and fails to pay or prepay the required toll.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> “Toll evader” means, for the purposes of this section, any person who uses a project, fails or refuses to pay or prepay the required toll, and deliberately circumvents or proceeds around or through a gate or other barrier on a project; and/or any toll violator who fails or refuses to pay or prepay the required toll on a tolled project at least twenty (20) or more times, received at least three (3) written notices from the authority (or its agent) regarding the non-payment of tolls, and is not a party to, or in current compliance with, a written repayment plan with the authority.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> The authority may promulgate appropriate rules and regulations to ensure the proper administration of the provisions of this section. Any person aggrieved by the authority’s assessment of any administrative fees may request review of such assessment through the process established by the authority, which shall not be subject to the provisions of chapter 35 of title 42.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(j)</b> For the purposes of this section only, “person” means the registered owner, EZPass account holder, driver, rentee, or lessee of a motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(k)</b> This section shall apply retroactively to all persons who are toll evaders as of the effective date of this act [October 1, 2016].</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(l)</b> Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to reduce or otherwise eliminate any tolls, fines, or penalties a person owes to the authority based upon violations occurring prior to the effective date of this act [October 1, 2016].</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(m)</b> It is unlawful for any person or business, other than an authorized representative of the authority, or any other duly authorized and existing toll or transportation agency, to sell, lease, rent, or offer for sale, lease or rent, any tokens, tickets, passes, transponders, or other evidences of payment issued for passage on any project. Any person or business who or that is found in violation of this subsection shall be punished, for each offense, by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(n)</b> If any provision of this section or its application to any person is deemed invalid, any such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions of this section that may lawfully be given effect without the invalid provision.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The general assembly finds that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The State of Rhode Island, through the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (“RIDOT”), funds the repair, replacement, and maintenance of bridges in Rhode Island, except the Newport Bridge and the Mount Hope Bridge.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Rhode Island depends on three primary sources for funding all transportation infrastructure construction, maintenance, and operations. These sources are Federal funds, State bond funds, and motor fuel tax revenue. Of these sources, two (Federal funds and motor fuel tax revenue) are mutable.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The 2008 Governor’s Blue Ribbon Panel on Transportation Funding and the 2011 Senate Special Commission on Sustainable Transportation funding determined that there is insufficient revenue available from all existing sources to fund the maintenance and improvement of Rhode Island transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> In 2011, the Rhode Island general assembly adopted a component of the recommended systemic change to transportation funding by creating the Rhode Island Highway Maintenance Trust Fund, to be funded by an increase in license and registration fees and contributions from the Rhode Island Capital Plan (RICAP) fund, beginning in FY2014.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> Although the State is shifting from long-term borrowing to annual revenues to fund transportation infrastructure, there is still a funding gap between the revenue needed to maintain all roads and bridges in good condition and the annual amounts generated by current revenue sources.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> The State has sufficient financial resources to complete the construction of the new Sakonnet River Bridge and to demolish the existing Sakonnet River Bridge, but does not have sufficient financial resources to assure the future maintenance and operation of the Sakonnet River Bridge.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> There is limited access to and from Rhode Island’s East Bay, consisting of Bristol and Newport Counties, and this access is restricted both by geography and infrastructure. The most critical infrastructure includes the four bridges that comprise the access to Aquidneck Island and Conanicut Island. These four bridges make up less than half a percent of the total bridges in the state, but comprise approximately twenty percent of the deck area of all Rhode Island bridges.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(8)</b> Two of the four bridges, the Sakonnet River Bridge and the Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge, are owned and maintained by RIDOT. The Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority (“RITBA”) currently owns and maintains the other two bridges: the Newport Bridge and the Mount Hope Bridge.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(9)</b> In the current economic and political climate, cooperation between State departments and/or quasi-public agencies provides the best opportunity to maximize financial and knowledge-based resources.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(10)</b> RITBA currently assesses a toll for passage over the Newport Bridge, and this toll serves as the sole source of revenue for RITBA to maintain both the Newport Bridge and the Mount Hope Bridge and related appurtenances.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(11)</b> The Federal Highway Administration allows for the placement of tolls on certain transportation infrastructure in order to assure the improvement and proper operation and maintenance of the structure and associated roadways.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(12)</b> The current toll structure places undue burden on the residents, businesses, and visitors who must use the Newport Bridge to access work, schools, shopping, and other essential services. It is crucial to establish a comprehensive strategy to fund and maintain the bridges connecting the East Bay.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(13)</b> The transfer of the Sakonnet River Bridge and its appurtenances and the Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge and its appurtenances to the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority would be in the best interests of the State of Rhode Island and its residents, particularly those living and working in the East Bay.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(14)</b> The placement of a toll on the Sakonnet River Bridge, under the direction of RITBA, would serve to create a more viable means of funding future maintenance and repairs of the East Bay bridges and would allow for the establishment of a more equitable toll structure, along with a fund for capital transportation projects and preventive maintenance in the East Bay.</p>

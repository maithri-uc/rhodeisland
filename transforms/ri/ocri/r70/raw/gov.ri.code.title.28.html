The reality of the interview process must be considered when analyzing a subjective legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason in failure-to-hire cases, and the town’s decisions to hire other applicants because they had more favorable interviews were not accompanied by the suspicion of mendacity that warranted an inference of discrimination.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was no error to find an employee alleging age discrimination in employment did not show an employer’s asserted nondiscriminatory reasons for firing the employee were not a pretext for discrimination because (1) a supervisor’s inconsistent affidavit did not show mendacity, and (2) evidence of the employee’s satisfactory performance did not show discrimination, nor did the employer’s failure to use the employer’s discretionary progressive-discipline policy or the employer’s failure to allege poor performance in unemployment compensation forms.

<p class="p6">The practice or policy of discrimination against individuals because of their race or color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, age, or country of ancestral origin is a matter of state concern. Such discrimination foments domestic strife and unrest, threatens the rights and privileges of the inhabitants of the state, and undermines the foundations of a free democratic state. The denial of equal employment opportunities because of such discrimination and the consequent failure to utilize the productive capacities of individuals to their fullest extent deprive large segments of the population of the state of earnings necessary to maintain decent standards of living, necessitates their resort to public relief, and intensifies group conflicts, thereby resulting in grave injury to the public safety, health, and welfare.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an employment discrimination case, disbelief of the defendant’s proffered explanation for the adverse employment action, combined with a suspicion of mendacity in connection with destroyed evidence and the elements of a prima facie case, may be sufficient evidence to survive a motion for judgment as a matter of law; however, when the evidence demonstrates that the defendant’s spoliation of evidence was the result of mere negligence, the adverse inference arising from a spoliation instruction, without more, may not be sufficient to establish the elements of the claim.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In answer to the certified question from the U.S. district court, R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When an officer sought to hold a police chief (chief) individually liable under R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-7(6), the statute did not provide for individual liability because (1) the statute was ambiguous on the question, and (2) the alleged unlawful employment practice involved the chief’s decision negatively affecting the officer’s chances for promotion, so the chief’s act was the sole alleged unfair employment practice at issue, requiring a finder of fact to determine the chief aided and abetted himself, which unacceptably contorted the statutory language. Mancini v. City of Providence, 155 A.3d 159, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 32 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When considering whether an officer could hold a police chief individually liable under R.I. Gen.

The employee had failed to cast any meaningful doubt on the employer’s reason for terminating her as part of a staff reduction, even if the employer might have failed to follow its staff reduction policy. Neri v. Ross-Simons, Inc., 897 A.2d 42, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 80 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court erred in granting defendant judgment as matter of law in an age discrimination case, as plaintiff established a prima facie case of discrimination, and the jury could have rejected defendant’s alleged non-discriminatory reasons for not hiring him based on its spoliation of evidence and testimony that it misrepresented that plaintiff was not qualified to teach English. McGarry v. Pielech, 47 A.3d 271, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 117 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an age discrimination case, the trial court did not err in granting a defendant a new trial, as it adequately set forth its belief that plaintiff’s claim was not supported by the weight of the evidence, and its determination that the jury gave an inordinate amount of weight and credence to defendant’s missing job interview notes was not clearly erroneous. McGarry v. Pielech, 47 A.3d 271, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 117 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Employee’s age and gender discrimination claims failed because (1) the employee resigned, instead of being discharged, and the employee did not sufficiently allege constructive discharge, as he did not allege he felt compelled to resign, and (2) the gender discrimination claim did not allege the employer sought a replacement with similar qualifications. Ferreira v. Child &amp; Family Servs. of R.I., 222 A.3d 69, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 143 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Bona Fide Occupational Qualifications.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where employee’s heart condition prevented her from working more than 40 hours a week, she was incapable of performing an essential function of her position, and she was not entitled to relief under the Fair Employment Practices Act because of her dismissal from a job for which she was no longer qualified. Tardie v. Rehabilitation Hosp., 6 F. Supp. 2d 125, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8468 (D.R.I. 1998), aff'd, 168 F.3d 538, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 2877 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Summary judgment was denied to defendant state employer and officers on plaintiff employee’s claim for failure to accommodate a visual impairment under the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-1 et seq., the Rhode Island Civil Rights of Individuals with Handicaps Act (RICRIHA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-87-1 et seq., and the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act (RICRA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-112-1 et seq., because in response to employees’ request for accommodation, the employers merely concluded that it involved an essential function of the job, which was not sufficient. Kriegel v. Rhode Island, 266 F. Supp. 2d 288, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9233 (D.R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Co-Employee Liability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subdivision (6) reaches past employers to forbid discriminatory acts by individual employees. Since the plaintiff has alleged that her supervisors were integral participants in the multiple forms of discrimination she suffered, proof of discrimination under any of her theories imposes individual liability on the supervisors as abettors, or worse.

<p class="p7"><b>Disability Discrimination.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Employee’s disability discrimination claim based on depression failed because working was the only activity that the employee claimed was limited, and her own testimony indicated that she could return to work for someone other than the supervisor.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>District court found that an employee who was disabled and receiving long-term disability benefits was not a “qualified individual with a disability” under 42 U.S.C. § 12111(a)(8) and did not state a valid claim alleging that his employer committed illegal discrimination under the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., when it reduced his benefits. However, the court found that the employee stated valid claims alleging that the employer committed illegal retaliation in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12203, R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-7, and R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although an employee who suffered from depression alleged that she was disabled as defined by R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-6(4) and that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation, she could not state a claim for disparate treatment under the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act because she failed to set forth any facts to show that she was treated less favorably than someone outside her protected class.

Warwick Teachers' Union Local 915 v. School Comm., 121 R.I. 806, 402 A.2d 1190, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2057 (1979).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was more than sufficient evidence to support the trial justice’s denial of a motion for judgment for the defendant as a matter of law since the evidence established that, despite being pregnant at the time of termination, an employee was amply qualified to perform her work, and she was fired approximately two weeks after first informing her employer of her pregnancy and replaced by someone outside the protected class. Accardi v. Full Channel Tv, 771 A.2d 908, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 109 (R.I. 2001).</p>

Laws § 28-5-1 et seq., is also applicable to actions brought under the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act (RICRA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-112-1 et seq., because to hold otherwise would allow a plaintiff that missed the FEPA deadline to bring the same allegations under RICRA, which would be contrary to public policy. Rathbun v. Autozone, Inc., 253 F. Supp. 2d 226, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4713 (D.R.I. 2003), aff'd, 361 F.3d 62, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 5126 (1st Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claims for gender-based promotions upon which plaintiff employee relied as evidence of unequal treatment were discrete acts that fell outside the one year limitations period and were time-barred; however, the claims for unequal pay were continuing in nature and were not time-barred.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because an employee’s layoff constituted a discrete act to which the continuing violation exception did not apply and there was no indicia of discriminatory animus based on the employee’s age, the motion justice correctly granted summary judgment to the employer on the employee’s claims under R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Language of the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act, R.I. Gen.

Olamuyiwa v. Zebra Atlantek, Inc., 45 A.3d 527, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 80 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Statute of Limitations.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a certified question from a federal district court pursuant to R.I. Sup. Ct. art. I, R. 6, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island holds that the one-year statute of limitations of R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-17(a) of the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-1, applied to employment discrimination cases brought under the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act (RICRA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-112-1 et seq., because (1) as the FEPA and the RICRA are in pari materia with respect to employment discrimination claims, harmonization of the two statutes is best achieved by engrafting onto the RICRA the one-year statute of limitations contained in the FEPA, R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-17(a); (2) application of the three-year residual statute of limitations of R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14(b) would in effect render meaningless the one-year statute of limitations of R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-17(a) contained in the FEPA by allowing plaintiffs an end run around the limitations provision of the latter statute; and (3) FEPA reflects the Rhode Island General Assembly’s weighing of policy considerations and its legislative judgment that one year is the appropriate amount of time within which claims of employment discrimination should be brought, and the Supreme Court of Rhode Island is unable to perceive any adequate reason for not holding that the same legislative determination should be applied to RICRA, bearing in mind that it is a later-enacted statute and (significantly) is silent as to the limitations issue.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Election of remedies doctrine was inapplicable to former employer’s declaratory judgment action in superior court concerning the effect of a release agreed to by the employee; it did not matter that a former employer opted not to have the discrimination case removed to superior court under this section since the employer did not commence the litigation before the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights and thus did not affirmatively elect any remedy. Consequently, the employer was entitled to have the question of the validity and enforceability of the contractual settlement agreement passed upon by the courts.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is absolutely no ambiguity in the statutory language of the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA), R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff was not entitled to a jury trial under either Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act or under this chapter, since her request for back pay supplements constituted a request for purely equitable relief.

For purposes of this subsection, an employer’s self-evaluation may be of the employer’s own design or on standard template or form to be issued by the department of labor and training, as long as the scope and detail of the self-evaluation reflects the exercise of due diligence by the employer to identify, prevent, and mitigate violations of this chapter in light of the size of the employer.</p>

If an employer fails to retain the records necessary to show the manner in which it evaluated and applied these factors, it may give rise to an inference that the employer did not exercise due diligence in conducting its self-evaluation.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> In determining whether an employer has eliminated an unlawful wage differential revealed by its self-evaluation, the court shall determine whether the employer has adjusted salaries or wages in order that employees performing comparable work are paid equally and whether any salary or wage adjustments have been completed prior to commencement of the action. An employer shall have ninety (90) days from the date of completion of its self-evaluation to adjust wages beginning from the day in the pay period the self-evaluation was completed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The affirmative defense to liability set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall be available to employers beginning on January 1, 2023, and ending June 30, 2026. Thereafter, an employer who has conducted a self-evaluation and eliminated any unlawful differentials as provided in subsection (a) of this section shall not be liable for liquidated damages or compensatory damages under § 28-6-20 or civil penalties under § 28-6-21; provided, however, that nothing contained in this subsection (b) shall prevent an employee aggrieved by an unlawful wage differential from filing a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction to obtain unpaid wages and equitable relief; provided, further, that in lieu of an employer being relieved of liability for liquidated damages and compensatory damages under § 28-6-20 or civil penalties under § 28-6-21, an employer who or that has conducted a self-evaluation and eliminated any unlawful differentials as provided in subsection (a) of this section, and compensated the employee for any unpaid wages, shall have an affirmative defense to all liability.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Evidence that a self-evaluation has been conducted or that remedial steps have been undertaken in accordance with this section is not sufficient evidence, standing alone, to find a violation of §§ 28-6-18(a) through (e) that occurred prior to the date of the completion of the self-evaluation.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Limitations Period.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Violations of the employer drug testing statute (EDTS) result in “injuries to the person” as contemplated by the three-year statute of limitations and, accordingly, are subject to the three-year period in § 9-1-14 rather than the 10-year period in § 9-1-13; moreover, actions under § 9-1-2 for civil liability for the victims of criminal offenses, which would include the misdemeanor offense created by the EDTS, are also subject to the three-year statute of limitations. Because an employee filed her action more than three years after the alleged violation of the EDTS, the claims were time-barred. Goddard v. APG Security-RI, LLC, 134 A.3d 173, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 34 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Reasonable Grounds.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence supported the trial justice’s conclusion that the employee’s supervisors had reasonable grounds—based on their contemporaneous observations concerning the employee’s appearance, behavior, and speech—to believe that the employee was under the influence of a controlled substance despite the employee’s contentions that he was under the influence of extreme pain from a work-related injury at the time; and thus that the employer was authorized to require the employee to take a drug test and properly terminated the employee for his refusal to do so.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The economic necessity for employees to possess full freedom of association, actual liberty of contract, and bargaining power equal to that of their employers, who are frequently organized in corporate or other forms of association, has long been sanctioned by public opinion, and recognized and affirmed by legislatures and the highest courts. As the modern industrial system has progressed, there has developed between and among employees and employers an ever greater economic interdependence and community of interest which have become matters of vital public concern. Employers and employees have recognized that the peaceable practice and wholesome development of that relationship and interest are materially aided by the general adoption and advancement of the procedure and practice of bargaining collectively as between equals. It is in the public interest that equality of bargaining power be established and maintained. It is likewise recognized that the denial by some employers of the right of employees freely to organize and the resultant refusal to accept the procedure of collective bargaining substantially and adversely affect the interest of employees, other employers, and the public in general. This denial creates variations and instability in competitive wage rates and working conditions within and between industries and between employees and employers engaged in those industries, and by depressing the purchasing power of wage earners and the profits of business, tends to:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Produce and aggravate recurrent business depressions;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Increase the disparity between production and consumption;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Create unemployment with its attendant dangers to the health, peace and morale of the people; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> Increase public and private expenditures for relief of the needy and the unemployed.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> When some employers deny the right of employees to full freedom of association and organization, and refuse to recognize the practice and procedure of collective bargaining, their actions lead to strikes, lockouts, and other forms of industrial strife and unrest which are inimical to the public safety and welfare, and frequently endanger the public health.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Experience has proved that protection by law of the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively removes certain recognized sources of industrial strife and unrest, encourages practices fundamental to the friendly adjustment of industrial disputes arising out of differences as to wages, hours, or other working conditions, and tends to restore equality of bargaining power between and among employers and employees, thereby advancing the interests of employers as well as employees.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> In the interpretation and application of this chapter and otherwise, it is declared to be the public policy of the state to encourage the practice and procedure of collective bargaining, and to protect employees in the exercise of full freedom of association, self organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing for the purposes of collective bargaining, or other mutual aid and protection, free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of their employers.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> All the provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of this purpose.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> This chapter shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the state for the protection of the public welfare, prosperity, health, and peace of the people of the state.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Union representing correctional officers did not have standing to bring individual breach of contract claims against the state because the statute referred to individual contracts between an employer and an employee, rather than to a contractual obligation under a collective bargaining agreement; furthermore, the union failed to allege in its complaint that it had attained the correctional officers’ consent to bring suit.

If a notice has been personally served on the party of an intention to conduct the arbitration pursuant to the provisions of a contract or submission specified in the notice, the issues specified in this subdivision may be raised only by a motion for a stay of the arbitration, notice of which motion must be served within ten (10) days after the service of the notice of intention to arbitrate.

The arbitration hearing shall be adjourned upon service of the notice pending the determination of the motion.

In the event that the opposing party is unsuccessful he or she may, nevertheless, participate in the arbitration if the arbitration is still being carried on.

This necessary prohibition does not, however, require the denial to these municipal employees of other well recognized rights of labor such as the right to organize, to be represented by a labor organization of their choice, and the right to bargain collectively concerning wages, rates of pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> It is declared to be the public policy of this state to accord to the permanent uniformed members, rescue service personnel of any city or town, emergency medical services personnel of any city or town, and all employees of any paid fire department in any city or town all of the rights of labor other than the right to strike or engage in any work stoppage or slowdown. To provide for the exercise of these rights, a method of arbitration of disputes is established.</p>

This necessary prohibition does not require the denial to these municipal employees of other well recognized rights of labor such as the right to organize, to be represented by an organization of their choice, and the right to bargain collectively concerning wages, rates of pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> It is declared to be the public policy of this state to accord to full-time police officers of any paid police department in any city or town all of the rights of labor other than the right to strike or engage in any work stoppage or slowdown.

<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The establishment of this method of arbitration shall not in any way, be deemed to be a recognition by the state of compulsory arbitration as a superior method of settling labor disputes between employees who possess the right to strike and their employers, but rather is solely a recognition of the necessity to provide some alternative mode of settling disputes where employees must, as a matter of public policy, be denied the usual right to strike.</p>

<p class="p6">While the parties are engaged in negotiations and/or utilizing the dispute resolution process as required in § 28-9.3-9, all terms and conditions in the collective bargaining agreement shall remain in effect.

Following the conclusion of the dispute resolution process as required in § 28-9.3-9, should the parties still be unable to reach agreement, all contractual provisions related to wages and benefits contained in the collective bargaining agreement, except for any contractual provisions that limit layoffs, shall continue as agreed to in the expired collective bargaining agreement until such time as a successor agreement has been reached between the parties. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the representative of the certified public school teachers and the school committee from mutually agreeing to submit all unresolved issues to binding arbitration pursuant to the procedures set forth in §§ 28-9.3-10 — 28-9.3-12.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although under normal circumstances, questions concerning the validity and enforceability of collective bargaining agreements for an expired school year are moot, there are two exceptions to this rule: (1) when the parties stipulate that “identical legal questions” apply to the present agreement as well as to the earlier contract, or (2) when the court finds that the question is of significant public interest or that similar occurrences may evade review in the future.

<p class="p7"><b>Legislative Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature, in mandating arbitration in conflicts arising in the negotiation process and in declaring arbitration to be final and not appealable unless procured by fraud or in violation of law, intended arbitration to relate only to resolving substantive terms that will be part of a new contract and not to settling controversies relating to the terms of an executed contract. Belanger v. Matteson, 115 R.I. 332, 346 A.2d 124, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1155 (1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 968, 96 S. Ct. 1466, 47 L. Ed. 2d 736, 1976 U.S. LEXIS 309 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Review.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the statute provides that arbitrator’s decisions can be appealed to the superior court the statute does not provide for judicial review of the action taken in the superior court and therefore the only way such matter can be brought to the Supreme Court is by writ of certiorari.

The “labor-nexus” test, however, is not necessarily controlling in future cases, as a broader definition of those employees considered to be “confidential” may be desirable in other circumstances.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The superior court properly concluded that the state labor board’s decision to include the position of secretary to the business manager of the school committee within the collective bargaining unit for all secretaries to the school committee was clearly erroneous in light of the evidence in the record concerning the secretary’s substantial and steady access to privileged labor relations materials and the absence of competent evidence in the record considered as a whole to support the labor board’s decision.

Although the employee was appointed by the local board of canvassers under R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-8-5(a), there was nothing to suggest that she was not employed by the town and part of the union’s bargaining unit where the town code’s definition of classified personnel specifically included persons appointed or employed in the service of the town; the CBA, by reference to R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-9.4-2(b), provided that municipal employees were members of the bargaining unit under the agreement; and allowing the union to arbitrate the employee’s grievance did not infringe on the board’s authority to appoint clerical employees.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The protection of the public health, safety, and welfare demands that the full-time state police officers of the state of Rhode Island not be accorded the right to strike or engage in any work stoppage or slowdown. This necessary prohibition does not require the denial to such state employees of other well recognized rights of labor, such as the right to organize, to be represented by an organization of their choice, and the right to bargain collectively concerning wages, rates of pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> It is declared to be the public policy of this state to accord to the full-time police officers of the state all of the rights of labor other than the right to strike or engage in any work stoppage or slowdown. To provide for the exercise of these rights, a method of arbitration of disputes is established.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The establishment of this method of arbitration shall not in any way, be deemed to be recognition by the state of compulsory arbitration as a superior method of settling labor disputes between employees who possess the right to strike and their employers, but rather is a recognition solely of the necessity to provide some alternative mode of settling disputes where employees must as a matter of public policy be denied the usual right to strike.</p>

It shall be of no concern to the director of labor and training how the employer arrives at its wage scale so long as it is not unreasonable in its demands on the employee.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Where, in the case of the employment of a full-time student who has not attained his or her nineteenth (19th) birthday engaged in the activities of a nonprofit association or corporation, whose aims and objectives are religious, educational, librarial, or community service in nature, the employer-employee relationship does exist, the employer shall pay to each such employee wages at a rate of not less than ninety percent (90%) of the minimum wage as specified in § 28-12-3. In case of any conflict between provisions of this section and those of § 28-12-3.1, the provisions of § 28-12-3.1 shall govern.</p>

The hearing shall be scheduled within thirty (30) days of service of a formal complaint as provided herein. The person, business, corporation, or entity shall have an opportunity to be heard in respect to the matters complained of at the time and place specified in the notice. The hearing shall be conducted by the director or his or her designee.

Therefore, the court found that claims for statutory damages under 46 U.S.C.S. § 11107 on the grounds that the owners failed to provide them with written wage agreements prior to their fishing voyages, as required by 46 U.S.C.S. § 10601, dating from before August 31, 1998, were barred by laches in the cases of four crewmen and that the remaining crewmen were entitled to the total difference between what they earned and what a full share would have been for the trips.

<p class="p7"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where fishermen worked on voyages from 1993 to 2000 under lay share contracts contravening 46 U.S.C.S. § 10601, a trial court, in applying the doctrine of laches to fashion a remedy under 46 U.S.C.S. § 11107, correctly chose R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-14-20 as the most analogous statute of limitations and barred claims older than three years, as § 28-14-20 covered wages and comported with the hospitable view taken toward seaman; moreover, the lay shares that the fishermen were paid were “wages” within the meaning of R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-14-1(4), and the ten-year limitations period for contracts pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-13(a) was too broad. Doyle v.

<p class="p6">The employment of workers in industry in the state of Rhode Island under conditions resulting in unreasonably low wages and conditions injurious to their health and general welfare is a matter of grave and vital public concern. Any conditions of employment especially fostering such working conditions are therefore destructive of purposes already accepted as sound public policy by the general assembly and should be brought into conformity with that policy. Uncontrolled continuance of homework is such a condition; here wages are notoriously lower and working conditions endanger the health of the worker; the protection of factory industries, which must operate in competition with homework and of the workers employed in homeworking and of the public interest of the community at large in their health and well being, require strict control and gradual elimination of industrial homework.</p>

Access to the central file shall be in accordance with chapter 24.4 of title 23. The list of designated substances shall be available for public inspection during business hours at the office of the director of the department of labor and training. The department shall have all rights of entry and inspection as set out in § 28-20-12, and shall annually conduct and without notice to the employer, at least two hundred (200) inspections of employing units covered by this chapter to determine compliance.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Upon the finding of a violation arising from an inspection, the employer shall inform the employees and immediately undertake measures for the safety of the employees.

In case no notice is given, the minor shall be held to have waived his or her right of action at common law to recover damages for personal injuries.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By virtue of this section, an injured employee may not maintain a common law action against an employer for his or her injuries. Therefore, since the defendants were the directors, officers, agents and employees of the employer and, as such, have been given immunity from liability by the Legislature via this section, the exclusive remedy available to the plaintiff is workers’ compensation. The plaintiff’s theory of dual liability is without merit. Nunes v. Aiello, 664 A.2d 1121, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 214 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The exclusivity clause of the Workers’ Compensation Act bars a plaintiff from filing a second cause of action on the basis on a different legal theory for the same injuries on which his or her workers’ compensation claim was based. Manzi v. State, 687 A.2d 461, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 18 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since an injury to reputation is not an injury within the meaning of the workers’ compensation statute, the exclusivity provision did not bar an employee from maintaining a defamation action against her employer and co-workers. Nassa v. Hook-SupeRx, Inc., 790 A.2d 368, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 32 (R.I. 2002).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An Employee assigned by an employment agency to work for a company receives the same immunity from suit as would the company itself pursuant to this section, which gives immunity not only to the employer but also to its directors, officers, agents, or employees. Poirier v. Manpower Inc., 689 A.2d 1036, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 51 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When an employee assigned by an employment agency to work for an employer was injured on the job, an affidavit from the employer stating that it paid the agency for the employee’s services was sufficient to show the employer contracted with the agency for those services, making the employer a “special employer,” under R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-29-2(6)(ii), so the employer was immune from the employee’s suit, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-29-20, because the immunity the statute provided was intended to apply to special employers. Urena v. Theta Prods., 899 A.2d 449, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 89 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Language of R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-29-20, making an employer immune from suit when an employee was entitled to benefits under the Workers’ Compensation Act, R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the provisions of the Workers’ Compensation Act do not preclude an employee and employer from making an express contract providing for additional damages for an injury otherwise covered by the act, that contract must comply with the provisions of § 28-29-17.

<p class="p7"><b>Employer.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Accident victim’s negligence action against a tree services company was barred because the victim was employed by the company; an affiliated entity’s role with respect to the victim’s employment was an administrative function of providing paychecks and benefits, such as workers’ compensation benefits, while the company alone had dominion and control over the victim who suffered a personal injury while engaged as a foreman for a tree removal crew. Selby v. Baird, 240 A.3d 243, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 69 (R.I. 2020).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Exclusivity.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature did not intend the exclusivity provision of the worker’s compensation act to bar the independent statutory claims created by the fair employment practices act or the civil rights act, since to do so would frustrate a broad, fundamental public policy which fulfills the paramount purpose of preventing discrimination. Folan v. State/Department of Children, Youth, &amp; Families, 723 A.2d 287, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 24 (R.I. 1999).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Workers’ compensation exclusivity principles did not entitle an employer to judgment as a matter of law in an action raising many claims, such as breach of contract and violation of wiretap statutes, that were not subject to the Rhode Island Workers’ Compensation Act, so that the superior court properly exercised jurisdiction over the action; exclusivity as to some of the tort claims could have been raised as an affirmative defense, but it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial justice to deny the employer’s motion to amend where it was made well into the litigation and would have greatly prejudiced the former employee. Cady v. IMC Mortg. Co., 862 A.2d 202, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 204 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Hospital employee, who sustained injuries after falling in a hospital corridor and settled a workers’ compensation claim, pursuant to R.I.

<p class="p7"><b>Purpose of Act.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This act abolished the employee’s right to maintain a common law action for his injuries against his employer, who in turn was deprived of certain common law defenses previously available to him, in order to provide a simple and expeditious procedure by which an employee or his dependents would receive from his employer compensation for injuries sustained in industrial accidents. Mustapha v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 268 F. Supp. 890, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8282 (D.R.I.), aff'd, 387 F.2d 631, 1967 U.S. App. LEXIS 4049 (1st Cir. 1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section provided that the right to workers’ compensation, which insured a fixed rate of compensation to an injured employee without requiring any showing of employer negligence, was in lieu of all rights and remedies existing, either at common law or otherwise. Cacchillo v. H. Leach Machinery Co., 111 R.I. 593, 305 A.2d 541, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1251 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An employee covered under the Workers’ Compensation Act has no common-law right of action against the insurer because the act expressly addresses such claims and thus immunizes the carrier from liability under any common-law suit. Cianci v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 659 A.2d 662, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 155 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The worker’s compensation act focuses on the employee and his or her work-related injury while the fair employment practices act and the civil rights act focus on employer conduct that undermines equal opportunity in the workplace.

<p class="p7"><b>Special Employers.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A literal application of § 28-29-2(3)(iii)’s [now see § 28-29-2(6)] designation of the general employer as the employer in this section, thereby allowing an employee who has received workers’ compensation benefits to maintain a tort action against his special employer, destroys the compromise that is the foundation of the Workers’ Compensation Act. Such a construction would have the effect of encouraging litigation by employees that have received workers’ compensation benefits, the exact opposite of what the legislature intended. Therefore, a special employer is an entity granted immunity from suit by this section. Sorenson v. Colibri Corp., 650 A.2d 125, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 267 (R.I. 1994).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where plaintiff ’s husband received workers’ compensation benefits under the Workers’ Compensation Act and is therefore barred from pursuing a tort action for physical injuries against his employer, plaintiff is similarly barred from recovering for loss of consortium resulting from those injuries.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A plaintiff accepting workers’ compensation benefits may not pursue any other right to recovery based on the wrongful conduct of an entity immune from suit under this section. Thus, the plaintiff ’s action against an owner-lessor of a for-hire motor vehicle pursuant to § 31-34-4 is included within the ambit of this prohibition. DiQuinzio v.

<p class="p6">The acceptance of the provisions of chapters 29 — 38 of this title by a city or town, except for the city of Providence, shall be by vote of the electors of that town qualified to vote on a proposition to impose a tax or for the expenditure of money in town meeting assembled, or by vote of the town council of any town when authorized by their electors to accept the provisions of those chapters in behalf of that town. The acceptance of the provisions of those chapters by a city shall be by vote of the city council of that city. The acceptance of the provisions of chapters 29 — 38 of this title by a regional school district shall be by vote of the electors of that school district qualified to vote at financial meetings of that district, or by vote of the regional district school committee when authorized by those electors to accept the provisions of these chapters on behalf of that district. Electors of a town, or the town council authorized as provided in this section, or electors of a regional district or school committee, or the city council of a city, in accepting the provisions of those chapters in behalf of the town or city or regional school district, shall also designate the class of employees or the nature of the employment to which the provisions of those chapters shall apply. Upon the passage of any vote of acceptance the town or city clerk or regional committee secretary, as the case may be, shall file a certified copy of that vote with the director, and that filing shall be deemed on the part of that town, city, or regional school district a sufficient compliance with the provisions of § 28-29-8 requiring notice of the election of an employer to become subject to its provisions. If the vote does not designate the class of employees or the nature of the employment to which the provisions of chapters 29 — 38 of this title are to apply, then those provisions shall apply to all employees of the town, city, or regional school district in behalf of which the vote is passed, except those employees who are excluded under the definition of employees set forth in § 28-29-2. The filing of a copy of the vote as provided in this section shall render the town, city, or regional school district in behalf of which that vote is filed subject to the provisions of those chapters in accordance with that vote for the term of one year from the date of that filing, and subsequently for successive terms of one year, unless the vote of acceptance is rescinded by the electors or the town council of the town, the city council of that city, or the school committee, and a certified copy of that rescission shall be filed with the director at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the first of each succeeding year.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Workers’ compensation does not substitute as general health insurance or afford full remuneration for all injuries associated with work. Wright v. Rhode Island Superior Court, 535 A.2d 318, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 2 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Aggravation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Death from disease was not compensable where accident in employment neither caused nor substantially accelerated the disease nor reduced employee’s ability to work. Keith v. Narragansett Elec. Co., 53 R.I. 160, 164 A. 907, 1933 R.I. LEXIS 45 (1933).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Clubfoot caused by industrial accident followed by excessive marching as a soldier was compensable. Mondillo v. Ward Baking Co., 73 R.I. 473, 57 A.2d 447, 1948 R.I. LEXIS 18 (1948).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Decree denying compensation was justified by evidence that incapacity was due to disease not aggravated by accident. Conti v. Washburn Wire Co., 77 R.I. 31, 72 A.2d 842, 1950 R.I. LEXIS 33 (1950).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an incident connected with employment aggravates an existing condition with resulting incapacity for work, an employee is entitled to compensation for that incapacity. Clemm v. Frank Morrow Co., 90 R.I. 37, 153 A.2d 557, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 111 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Basically, two types of aggravation are compensable. The first type occurs when the employee is suffering from a pre-existing disease or infirmity, that the employment aggravates or accelerates to produce a disability, for which the employee is not required to show that the original infirmity or disease arose out of or in the course of employment. The second type of aggravation usually occurs when the employee suffers a work-related injury that is aggravated by medical or surgical treatment. Lomba v. Providence Gravure, 465 A.2d 186, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1079 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Causal Connection.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The right to be compensated for incapacity resulting from an injury accrues to the injured employee upon the establishment of a nexus between the injury and his employment. Tromba v. Harwood Mfg. Co., 94 R.I. 3, 177 A.2d 186, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 20 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In P.L. 1949, ch. 2282, the act was amended and the phrase “personal injury by accident arising out of the and in the course of his employment” was changed to read “personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment connected therewith and referable thereto” thus deleting the words “by accident” from the act, and since then the words “personal injury” have been given a broader interpretation than the words “personal injury by accident,” the words “personal injury” comprehending a wide range of physical harm. Gartner v. Jackson's, Inc., 95 R.I. 489, 188 A.2d 85, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 26 (1963).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In order to establish the necessary causal connection between an employee’s disability and his employment, the incapacity must be the probable result of the work-related incident, not merely a possible consequence. Natale v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 119 R.I. 713, 382 A.2d 1313, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 607 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an employee sustained an injury in 1956 for which he entered into a preliminary agreement with his employer for compensation, describing the injury as a “back injury,” sustained a second injury in 1958, for which he entered into a preliminary agreement which stated that the previous injury had been aggravated, and his physician testified that his incapacity in 1963 was due to the 1956 injury and not to the 1958 injury, he failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his 1963 incapacity was causally connected with the 1958 injury. Roy v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., 99 R.I. 638, 210 A.2d 125, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 495 (1965).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An employee’s injury is compensable if the particular facts and circumstances presented establish a “nexus” or a “causal relationship” between the injury and the employment. Bottomley v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp., 441 A.2d 553, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1165 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To establish a nexus or causal relationship between the injury and his employment, the employee must show that his injury occurred within the period of his employment, at a place where he might reasonably have been, and while either fulfilling the duties of his employment or doing something incidental thereto or to the conditions under which those duties were to be performed. Bottomley v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp., 441 A.2d 553, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1165 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In workers’ compensation cases, the term “causal relationship” is not to be equated with the term “proximate cause” as found in negligence actions. In workers’ compensation cases, it is enough if the conditions and nature of the employment contribute to the injury. Mulcahey v. New Eng. Newspapers, 488 A.2d 681, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 439 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Employer’s concession that employee suffered from an occupational disease contracted while working that rendered her partially incapacitated amounted to an admission that removed the issue of causation from the area of controversy. Dino v. Arkwright, Inc., 526 A.2d 520, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 510 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Random assault of an employee by a stranger while the employee was returning to his work vehicle, which was parked on the street, was compensable under R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-33-1, as it was an actual risk of employment under the street-peril doctrine; the denial of workers’ compensation benefits was accordingly error under R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-35-30. Ellis v. Verizon New Eng., Inc., 63 A.3d 510, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 57 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Health Conditions.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Injuries sustained in fall from great height on employer’s premises were compensable even though fall was caused by a fainting spell not related to employment. Corry v. Commissioned Officers' Mess (Open), 78 R.I. 264, 81 A.2d 689, 1951 R.I. LEXIS 69 (1951).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Injury in Treatment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Injury while visiting physician’s office in connection with a previous compensable injury was not compensable. De Lallo v. Queen Dyeing Co., 73 R.I. 325, 56 A.2d 174, 1947 R.I. LEXIS 91 (1947).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Course of Employment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>— After Hours.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Accident sustained after quitting work but while retrieving coat while still on the premises was compensable. Distante v. United E. R. Co., 53 R.I. 258, 165 A. 772, 1933 R.I. LEXIS 73 (1933).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, after having rung out, petitioner returned to employer’s building to seek assistance for inoperative car parked on a parking lot maintained solely for employees by employer, and fell down a flight of stairs sustaining serious injury; such fall was an incident of petitioner’s employment since she returned to seek assistance, a known practice encouraged by her employer’s representative, the foreman. Fontaine v. Tupper Co., 94 R.I. 111, 178 A.2d 452, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 41 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where claimant was injured on premises after hours, and he testified that there was no reason for his being there at that time, there was sufficient evidence to conclude that the injury did not occur in the course of employment. Knowlton v. Porter Trucking Co., 117 R.I. 28, 362 A.2d 131, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1596 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Deviation From Duties.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Deviation from the duties of employment does not in and of itself destroy the causal nexus. However, the deviation must be substantially motivated by influences that originated in the employment. Lomba v. Providence Gravure, 465 A.2d 186, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1079 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The workers’ compensation commission erred in awarding disability benefits to an employee for an injury that occurred when the employee raised his hand in order to touch a fellow employee. Lomba v. Providence Gravure, 465 A.2d 186, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1079 (R.I. 1983).</p>

Trudeau v. United States Rubber Co., 92 R.I. 328, 168 A.2d 460, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 34 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pain is not compensable under the compensation statute. Rather, the employee must prove that the disputed treatment would relieve, rehabilitate, or cure his disability. Bissonnette v. Federal Dairy Co., 472 A.2d 1223, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 474 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Appeal.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Appeal was properly before the supreme court for the purpose of determining whether there was any legal evidence to support the findings that the medical bills in question were reasonable since the main contention on appeal was that the decree appealed from was not supported by legal evidence and that it was therefore against law, it being well settled that findings of fact which are not supported by legal evidence amount to errors of law and will be reviewed by the supreme court upon appeal. McCoy v. Cataldo, 88 R.I. 330, 148 A.2d 267, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 11 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where trial commissioner (now judge) did not give consideration to the applicability of this section the ends of justice required remanding case to workers’ compensation commission (now court) for the making of such findings of fact as they may deem proper upon reconsideration.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An extra firm mattress purchased by claimant upon advice of physician for relief of a back injury was an apparatus within the meaning of this section. Izzi v. Royal Electric Corp., 100 R.I. 380, 216 A.2d 363, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 444 (1966).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section confers on the workers’ compensation commission (now court) authority to require employers to furnish injured employees with surgical appliances or apparatus designed to cure or relieve the effects of the injury. Craven v. United States Rubber Co., 103 R.I. 126, 235 A.2d 85, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 584 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an employee had purchased a wig to cover a bald spot resulting from a work related injury, she was not entitled to reimbursement from the employer because the wig was not medical in nature although it did contribute to her rehabilitation; however, the court said that had the wig been prescribed by a doctor, it might have qualified as being medical in nature. Lemoine v. Coby Glass Prods. Co., 115 R.I. 86, 341 A.2d 40, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1122 (1975), overruled, Fallon v. Skin Med. &amp; Surgery Ctrs., 713 A.2d 777, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 211 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Paralyzed claimant’s request that he be provided with an automatic lift or elevator was denied, despite his physician’s testimony that an elevator would relieve him from the effects of his injury, since to be chargeable to the employer under this section benefits must be medical in nature.

<p class="p7"><b>— Reasonableness.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While, under this section, an employer is required to supply a certain type of mattress to an employee with a back injury if it is recommended by the attending physician, he is entitled to a hearing before the commission (now court) on whether the cost of a purchased article is reasonable and whether such item is necessary for the cure, rehabilitation, or relief of his employee, before his liability attaches. Geigy Chemical Corp. v. Zuckerman, 106 R.I. 534, 261 A.2d 844, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 955 (1970).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The introduction in evidence of medical bills, supported only petitioner’s testimony that he visited the doctors in question because of his back condition, but was not sufficient proof that their services were rendered in order to cure, rehabilitate or relieve him from the effects of the injury described in the preliminary agreement for the payment of which respondent was liable. Gray v. Kagan, 90 R.I. 398, 158 A.2d 572, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 31 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction of Court.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Nothing in this section in any way inhibits the commission’s (now court’s) jurisdiction to act upon an employee’s petition for medical benefits solely by reason of the fact that her request, although filed when the employer was paying her weekly compensation benefits, was not heard or adjudicated until after the expiration of the obligatory compensation period. Fusaro v. Berkshire Hathaway, 106 R.I. 639, 262 A.2d 381, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 967 (1970).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The requirement of this section for prior approval of major surgery is not exclusive in the sense that it prevents the commission (now court) from giving prior consideration and approval of other forms of treatment.

<p class="p7"><b>Medical Treatment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Reasonableness.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The standard for determining what a reasonable medical treatment is for purposes of this section should be whether the medical treatment is accepted by doctors at the national level. Pola v. Health-Tex, 605 A.2d 1321, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 80 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since thermography is not an accepted medical treatment on the national level, it cannot be a reasonable medical treatment that helps to cure, to rehabilitate, or to relieve an injured worker as required by this section. Therefore, the thermogram is not a medical procedure for which an employer must compensate a doctor who performs such procedure on an injured worker. Pola v. Health-Tex, 605 A.2d 1321, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 80 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Other Attendance or Treatment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The term “other attendance or treatment” used in this section did not include a worker in claimant’s home to perform household duties and assist her personally, although such worker was required because of the claimant’s disability.

<p class="p7"><b>— Services Rendered by Spouse.</b></p>

The burden shall be upon the petitioner seeking payment of the medical bill to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the rate, as applied, is unreasonable in light of the peculiar nature of the services performed or other circumstances requiring a greater than normal expertise or expenditure of time or effort in providing the service.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a) (1)</b> An injured employee shall initially have freedom of choice to obtain health care, diagnosis, and treatment from any qualified healthcare provider. The initial healthcare provider of record may, without prior approval, refer the injured employee to any qualified specialist for independent consultation or assessment, or specified treatment. If the insurer or self-insured employer has a preferred-provider network approved and kept on record by the medical advisory board, any change by the employee from the initial healthcare provider of record shall only be to a healthcare provider listed in the approved preferred-provider network; provided, however, that any contract proffered or maintained that restricts or limits the healthcare provider’s ability to make referrals pursuant to the provisions of this section; restricts the injured employee’s first choice of healthcare provider; substitutes or overrules the treatment protocols maintained by the medical advisory board; or attempts to evade or limit the jurisdiction of the workers’ compensation court shall be void as against public policy. If the employee seeks to change to a healthcare provider not in the approved preferred-provider network, the employee must obtain the approval of the insurer or self-insured employer. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the treatment, care, or rehabilitation of an employee by more than one physician, dentist, or hospital. The employee’s first visit to any facility providing emergency care or to a physician or medical facility under contract with or agreement with the employer or insurer to provide priority care, shall not constitute the employee’s initial choice to obtain health care, diagnosis, or treatment.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Within three (3) days of an initial visit following an injury, the healthcare provider shall provide to the insurer or self-insured employer, and the employee and his or her attorney, a notification of compensable injury form to be approved by the administrator of the medical advisory board. Within three (3) days of the injured employee’s release or discharge, return to work, and/or recovery from an injury covered by chapters 29 — 38 of this title, the healthcare provider shall provide a notice of release to the insurer or self-insured employer, and the employee and his or her attorney, on a form approved by the division. A thirty dollar ($30.00) fee may be charged by the healthcare provider to the insurer or self-insured employer for the notification of compensable injury forms or notice of release forms or for affidavits filed pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, but only if filed in a timely manner. No claim for care or treatment by a physician, dentist, or hospital chosen by an employee shall be valid and enforceable as against his or her employer, the employer’s insurer, or the employee, unless the physician, dentist, or hospital gives written notice of the employee’s choice to the employer/insurance carrier within fifteen (15) days after the beginning of the services or treatment. The healthcare provider shall, in writing, submit to the employer or insurance carrier an itemized bill and report for the services or treatment and a final itemized bill for all unpaid services or treatment within three (3) months after the conclusion of the treatment.

<p class="p7"><b>Purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By providing a conclusive presumption that the spouse and children of the deceased are wholly dependent under this section, the legislature clearly indicated its intent to provide benefits to those individuals before allowing recovery to anyone else. Stone v. Goulet, 522 A.2d 216, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 432 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Contention of petitioner that she was entitled to a decision on the principle of liberal interpretation in view of the observation of the full commission that this was a case where the single commissioner might have found either way, since there was evidence to support both propositions, completely ignored the fundamental rule that she was required to establish her case by a fair preponderance of the evidence, and therefore contention was not sustained.

<p class="p7"><b>Children Living Apart.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Children living apart who were partially dependent on employee were conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent. Martin v. Narragansett Elec. Lighting Co., 49 R.I. 265, 142 A. 225, 1928 R.I. LEXIS 49 (1928).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Husband.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As to a husband living with his wife, the presumption in subsection (b) of this section is not an evidentiary presumption, but a statement of a substantive rule of law, it being the intention of the legislature, in such a situation, to compensate a surviving husband for the loss of consortium and other conjugal blessings characteristic of a marital union, the status of which establishes it as a basic biosocial unit in our society. Cataldo v. Admiral Inn, 102 R.I. 1, 227 A.2d 199, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 635 (1967).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that an employee with a back injury had obtained employment as a salesman and bill collector that paid more than the employment in which he was injured was insufficient to sustain a finding of the commission that he was physically fit to return to his former employment as a chemical operator where the only medical evidence was that, while he was physically able to perform the work, doing so would subject him to a real danger of his disk slipping again and a return of his disability.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> It is the intent of the legislature that the costs resulting from fraud and abuse in the workers’ compensation system be arrested. In order to discourage potential abusers, employees must be aware of the affirmative duty to report earnings and the penalties for any fraud or abuse must be severe and certain.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Any employee entitled to receive weekly workers’ compensation benefits shall have an affirmative duty to report those earnings, including wages or salary remuneration paid for personal services, commissions, and bonuses, including the cash value of all remuneration payable in any medium other than cash, earned from self-employment or from any employer other than the employer in whose employ he or she was injured, so that compensation benefits may be properly computed.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c) (1)</b> The department of labor and training, employer, or insurer shall notify any employee receiving weekly workers’ compensation benefits, on forms prescribed by the department, of that employee’s affirmative duty to report earnings and shall specifically notify the employee that a failure to report earnings may subject him or her to civil or criminal liability.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Any employee entitled to weekly workers’ compensation benefits for any period of time shall, upon written request of the employer or insurer, provide at reasonable intervals to the employer or insurer an earnings report, on forms prescribed by the department, advising the employer or insurer of the exact amount of earnings for each week of his or her entitlement to benefits or advising that no earnings were received for particular weeks, so that the employer or insurer may properly compute the amount of benefits due to the employee.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> If any employee refuses to submit an earnings report upon request by the employer or insurer his or her rights to compensation may be suspended and his or her compensation during that period of suspension may be forfeited.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Where any employee is found to be entitled to benefits in excess of fifty-two (52) weeks pursuant to a decision resulting in the entry of an order or decree, he or she shall submit an earnings report as described in subsection (d) of this section.

<p class="p7"><b>Anticipatory Decree.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Decree could not, on the basis of medical prediction, reach into the future to determine when incapacity would cease, particularly where employee had been unable to find light work of nature required for his rehabilitation. Walsh-Kaiser Co. v. D'Ambra, 73 R.I. 37, 53 A.2d 479, 1947 R.I. LEXIS 45 (1947); Walsh-Kaiser Co. v. Champness, 73 R.I. 44, 53 A.2d 483, 1947 R.I. LEXIS 46 (1947).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The burden is clearly on the employee to prove with some specificity his loss of earning capacity. Rodiboux v. Uniroyal, Inc., 121 R.I. 796, 403 A.2d 262, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1980 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claimant has burden of proof to show loss of earning capacity. Weber v. American Silk Spinning Co., 38 R.I. 309, 95 A. 603, 1915 R.I. LEXIS 69 (1915).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The burden is upon the employer to prove the amount, if any, that an employee is able to earn at another occupation that is neither unhealthy nor injurious. Andrade v. Mintell, 102 R.I. 148, 229 A.2d 50, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 660 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Calculation of Award.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Appellate Division was correct in crediting the employer for wages actually earned by the employee, including overtime pay. Wehr, Inc. v. Truex, 700 A.2d 1085, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 267 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Appellate Division did not err in declining to set an earnings capacity for an employee who received variable post-injury wages. Wehr, Inc. v. Truex, 700 A.2d 1085, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 267 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Capacity Before Injury.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Employee’s earning capacity should be measured against his capacity before the injury, rather than against what the average man of his age could or should do. Walsh-Kaiser Co. v. Kooharian, 72 R.I. 390, 51 A.2d 832, 1947 R.I. LEXIS 18 (1947).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Commissioner’s Powers.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Factfinding is the sole prerogative of the commission, and evidence concerning “wages” received by an employee on his return to work is relevant on the issue of the extent of the employee’s earning capacity and is entitled to such weight as the commission might choose to give it. Brown v. Hope Serv. Station, 122 R.I. 74, 403 A.2d 1387, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2039 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Workers’ Compensation Commission had no power to establish an earning capacity for partially incapacitated employee for purposes of decreasing compensation benefits. Podborski v. Haskell, 109 R.I. 1, 279 A.2d 914, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1017 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Partial incapacity as well as total incapacity were findings to be made by the commission and the fact that the employee’s petition sought only total incapacity benefits did not necessarily preclude the employee from complaining of the commission’s failure to award partial incapacity benefits. Surgento v. American Luggage Works, 114 R.I. 499, 335 A.2d 634, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1444 (1975).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Computation of Earning Capacity.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In enacting this section, the Legislature specifically excluded overtime pay from the calculation of pre-injury earnings but not from the computation of post-injury earnings. The failure specifically to exclude overtime pay from post-injury wages in light of its earlier exclusion from pre-injury earnings is significant and indicative of the Legislature’s intent to include it in the computation of post-injury earnings. Wehr, Inc. v. Truex, 700 A.2d 1085, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 267 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Nothing in this provision requires that a trial judge use only a functional impairment rating to establish an earnings capacity. Star Enters. v. DelBarone, 746 A.2d 692, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 36 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction With § 28-33-17.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where one received total compensation for both partial and total incapacity the limitation provision is found in § 28-33-17 rather than herein. Kostiv v. Fedorowicz, 99 R.I. 343, 207 A.2d 387, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 443 (1965).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction With § 28-33-18.2.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-33-18(d) explicitly limits workers’ compensation benefits for partial incapacity to 312 weeks. Subsections (a) and (b) of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>§ 28-33-18, discussing the formula for calculating weekly partial incapacity benefits and for reducing those benefits once the worker has reached “maximum medical improvement” respectively, are both “subject to the provisions of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>§ 28-33-18.2.” Therefore, those subsections are effective unless the worker has accepted “suitable alternative employment,” in which case those subsections have no force.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mumma v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., 965 A.2d 437, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 25 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Court Costs.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Employee partially successful in appealing from decree of workers’ compensation commission under this section is entitled to his costs, including fees for counsel and expert witnesses. General Road Trucking Corp. v. Pina, 110 R.I. 7, 289 A.2d 425, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 870 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Duty to Search for Work.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An employee need not unsuccessfully conduct a bona fide search to find work he is capable of performing, or accept such work from his former employer, as a prerequisite of partial compensation. Cabral v. Converse Rubber Co., 121 R.I. 606, 401 A.2d 1281, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1878 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once an employee has been found to be only partially incapacitated and to have reached maximum medical improvement, the employee should be given a reasonable length of time in which to seek alternative employment before a hearing is held on the reduction mandated by subsection (b). K-Mart v. Whitney, 710 A.2d 667, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 154 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Effect of Decree.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Decree awarding compensation up to a specified date was not res judicata as to the right to compensation after that date. Bernier v. Narragansett Elec. Co., 56 R.I. 438, 186 A. 479, 1936 R.I. LEXIS 118 (1936).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Employer.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Neither the commission nor an employer has the power to establish an earning capacity for a partially incapacitated worker. Cabral v. Converse Rubber Co., 121 R.I. 606, 401 A.2d 1281, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1878 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Regardless of the employer’s good faith or the equity of its formula in practical application, it lacks the authority to unilaterally determine the extent of partial incapacity. Cabral v. Converse Rubber Co., 121 R.I. 606, 401 A.2d 1281, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1878 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An employee’s return to work, even though it may signal a reduction in or an end of any impairment of earning capacity, does not entitle the employer to unilaterally modify or terminate its continuing obligation to pay weekly benefits under a preliminary agreement, order or decree. Cabral v. Converse Rubber Co., 121 R.I. 606, 401 A.2d 1281, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1878 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was competent evidence which established that injured employee could perform a specific kind of light work and further evidence to establish the wages paid for the various jobs offered, it was within the power of the commission to make finding concerning the extent of the partial incapacity and earning capacity. School House Candy Co. v. Ferrucci, 88 R.I. 109, 143 A.2d 304, 1958 R.I. LEXIS 93 (1958).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence as to the wages an injured employee earns upon his return to his prior employment is material on the issue of his earning capacity and, when adduced, is entitled to such weight as the commission properly may give it. Tretton v. Atwood Crawford Co., 98 R.I. 346, 202 A.2d 286, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 179 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If there is any competent evidence of record, or reasonable inference to be drawn therefrom which supports the findings of the full commission, such findings, absent fraud, cannot be disturbed by the Supreme Court. Hassenfeld Bros. v. Wolowicz, 104 R.I. 620, 247 A.2d 834, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 695 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where salesman was injured in June, 1967, by lifting heavy bag of catalogs into his car, which injury was corrected by an operation and claimant’s physician testified that his total incapacity had ended in October, 1967, and that he would be able to use his car again in about a month, and claimant testified on December 12, 1967, that he was able to work and was looking for a job, the evidence sustained the commission’s denial of compensation benefits for the period subsequent to December 12, 1967. Allison v. Do All Providence Co., 105 R.I. 629, 254 A.2d 79, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 797 (1969).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an injured employee’s physician advised him to seek light work and, on his application to his employer for such work, was advised that the employer did not have any and no evidence was offered to establish the degree of the impairment of the employee’s earning capacity, the record lacked the prerequisite evidentiary basis for a proper award for the partial incapacity and should be returned to the commission for evidence on such subject. Saccoccio v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp., 107 R.I. 53, 264 A.2d 905, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 737 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where injured employee introduced no evidence of increased incapacity for work in a hearing to secure increased workers’ compensation benefits, the commission did not err in affirming the trial commissioner’s refusal to award the increase. Accioli v. Josal Constr. Co., 112 R.I. 215, 308 A.2d 498, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 973 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Final Decree.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions of the workers’ compensation act do not authorize a single commissioner to continue a petition for further hearing after having entered a decree determinative of all the issues raised by the petition. Beacon Milling Co. v. Whitford, 92 R.I. 253, 168 A.2d 279, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 30 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Finding of Partial Disability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The testimony of the injured employee, a physician employed by the employer’s insurer, and the reasonable inference of which such testimony was susceptible, absent fraud, provided a proper evidentiary basis for the commission’s finding that the employee was partially incapacitated. Albert Zabbo &amp; Sons v. Zabbo, 122 R.I. 79, 404 A.2d 487, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2070 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where petitioner was working for another employer at lighter work and less wages, a finding of partial disability was proper since the fact that she was laid off by respondent solely on account of lack of work and that union rules prevented rehiring had no bearing on partial disability. Shoren v. United States Rubber Co., 87 R.I. 319, 140 A.2d 768, 1958 R.I. LEXIS 59 (1958).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Increase in Earnings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where employee receiving benefits for partial disability on basis of actual earnings failed to report increase in earnings, resulting in overpayment by the employer, commission may grant to such employer credit for overpayment as against future payments to the employee. M. Samas Co. v. Cipriano, 110 R.I. 94, 290 A.2d 402, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 883 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Limitation on Amount Paid.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>So long as a partially incapacitated employee remains out of work, whatever the reason, he is entitled to the compensation ordinarily paid for total incapacity. Cabral v. Converse Rubber Co., 121 R.I. 606, 401 A.2d 1281, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1878 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Loss of Earning Capacity Required.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The right to compensation is predicated upon a reduction in earning capacity caused by an injury, rather than the injury itself. Cabral v. Converse Rubber Co., 121 R.I. 606, 401 A.2d 1281, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1878 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not compensate for physical injury unless there is a loss of earning capacity. Weber v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence that an employee had secured lighter work that paid him more than he was earning in the employment in which he was injured was sufficient to support a commission finding that his incapacity for work had ceased even though his physical condition as a result of his injury was such that it was not safe for him to return to his former employment. Geigy Chemical Corp. v. Zuckerman, 106 R.I. 534, 261 A.2d 844, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 955 (1970).</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> When an employee has sustained an injury which entitles the employee to receive benefits pursuant to § 28-33-18 or 28-34-3, the employee may become capable of suitable alternative employment as determined by the workers’ compensation court, or may be offered suitable alternative employment as agreed to by the employee and employer with written notice to the director. The employer or insurer shall pay an injured employee that accepts suitable alternative employment a weekly compensation equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent (662/3%) of the difference between the employee’s average weekly wage, earnings or salary before the injury and his or her weekly wages, earnings or salary from the suitable alternative employment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The acceptance of suitable alternative employment shall not be mandatory if it results in the inequitable forfeiture or loss of seniority with the employer or a monetary benefit or other substantial benefit including, but not limited to, vested pension and/or profit sharing contributions, arising from the employment relationship.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> If suitable alternative employment as determined by the workers’ compensation court has been offered to the employee and the employee has refused to accept the employment, then the workers’ compensation court shall, in fixing the amount of compensation payable subsequent to the refusal, treat earnings capacity as post injury earnings, requiring the employer or insurer to pay the injured employee a weekly compensation equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent (662/3%) of the difference between the employee’s average weekly wage, earnings, or salary before the injury and the weekly earning capacity. In no case shall increases in payments made to an injured employee pursuant to § 28-33-18.3(b)(1) or 28-33-17(f) be considered in the calculation of the weekly compensation due pursuant to this section. The fact that the employee is undergoing rehabilitation does not by itself exempt the employee from the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> If the suitable alternative employment is terminated by the employer for reasons other than misconduct by the employee, the injured employee shall be entitled to be compensated from the employer in whose employ he or she was injured at the rate to which the employee was entitled prior to acceptance of the employment after notice by the employee to the employer in whose employ he or she was injured. The payments shall be made no later than fourteen (14) days after the notice. If suitable alternative employment is terminated by the employer for misconduct of the employee, or by the employee, the compensation payable to the employee shall not exceed that payable during continuance of suitable alternative employment. Upon request to the workers’ compensation court, the employee shall have the right to a determination as to whether or not the termination was justified. Any employee who accepts suitable alternative employment with his or her employer of record shall continue to maintain the seniority status and all rights incidental to it that the employee enjoyed prior to his or her injury, except that these rights shall not exceed the current rights of a similar employee with equal seniority.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-33-18(d) does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of R.I. Const. art. I, § 2, because it does not infringe upon a fundamental right nor create a suspect class, and the legislature could have had a rational basis for limiting the potentially infinite and burdensome duration of partial incapacity benefits. Nichols v. R&amp;D Constr. Co., 60 A.3d 932, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 36 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction With § 28-33-17.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although these provisions are applicable to a partially disabled employee if he can show that his partial incapacity poses a material hindrance to obtaining suitable employment, there is a key distinction between qualifying for continued partial disability benefits and qualifying for total disability benefits via proof of odd-lot doctrine, which requires a showing that the employee is actually unable to perform his regular job and any alternative employment. Lombardo v. Atkinson-Kiewit, 746 A.2d 679, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 17 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>“Material Hindrance for Obtaining Employment.”</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-33-18.3(a)(1) does not contemplate the “inability to regain one’s earning capacity” as a basis for a “material hindrance to obtaining employment suitable to his or her limitations” in order for benefits to continue; the partial disability itself must serve as a “material hindrance.” Nichols v. R&amp;D Constr. Co., 60 A.3d 932, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 36 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As a workers’ compensation claimant was able to obtain employment after his injury, although he did not regain his pre-injury earning capacity, he did not meet his burden of proving that his incapacity posed a “material hindrance to obtaining employment suitable to his or her limitations” required in order for his benefits to continue under R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-33-18.3(a)(1). Nichols v. R&amp;D Constr. Co., 60 A.3d 932, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 36 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Requirements for Enjoining Application of Section.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Construction With Other Law.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 28-35-43, providing a penalty for the late payment of benefits, does not apply to one-time payments made pursuant to this section for specific injuries because it specifically refers, in its first sentence, only to payments that are made weekly. Bottini v. Shaw's Supermarket, 714 A.2d 595, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 250 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Death of Employee.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Payments under this section cease on the death of the employee from independent cause. George A. Fuller Co. v. Ryan, 69 R.I. 347, 33 A.2d 188, 1943 R.I. LEXIS 56 (1943) (decision prior to 1949 amendment of § 28-33-24).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Determination of Benefits.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The amount of benefits granted under this section for a specific condition is reduced by the amount received for the same injury out of which the specific condition arose. Fontaine v. Gorfine, 105 R.I. 174, 250 A.2d 361, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 735 (1969).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A loss compensable under this section is evaluated at that point at which rehabilitative procedures have been completed and functional development of the injured member or sense has reached its maximum potential. Walsh v. Department of Natural Resources, 120 R.I. 367, 388 A.2d 8, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 681 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A specific compensation award under this section for employee’s loss of use of extremities and disfigurement was subject to the suspension mechanism of § 28-35-58; the amount of the award reduced “on a dollar for dollar basis” the period of time during which the employer’s duty to pay future compensation benefits to the employee would be suspended. Rison v. Air Filter Sys., 707 A.2d 675, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 21 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Disfigurement.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Payment of compensation for disfigurement without requiring a showing that the disfigurement resulted in an impairment of earning capacity of the injured employee constitutes a valid exercise of the police power by a state legislature, and is not unconstitutionally vague. Matthews v. Falvey Linen Supply, 110 R.I. 558, 294 A.2d 398, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 952 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Statute requiring that a minor injured while illegally employed be awarded treble damages, § 28-33-22, was intended to apply to an award of compensation for disfigurement under subsection (n) of this section. Matthews v. Falvey Linen Supply, 110 R.I. 558, 294 A.2d 398, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 952 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was evidence that even though employer had furnished employee with an artificial eye, employee had been examined by trial commissioner with and without the eye, that occasional irritation required removal of the eye and wearing of dark glasses for a time, commissioner was justified in finding permanent disfigurement. St. Laurent v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp., 113 R.I. 10, 316 A.2d 504, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1130 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Double Loss.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Loss of phalanges of two toes was compensable for double the period allowed for loss of phalange of one toe. Gibbons v. United E. R. Co., 48 R.I. 353, 138 A. 175, 1927 R.I. LEXIS 136 (1927) (decision on facts arising prior to 1926 amendment).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>December, 1971, finding of 21 percent loss of use of claimant’s hand was irrelevant in measuring extent of claimant’s incapacity in early 1974. Molony &amp; Rubien Constr. Co. v. Segrella, 118 R.I. 340, 373 A.2d 816, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1465 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An injured employee claiming loss of hearing is not required to show that he is completely deaf but, rather, he must satisfy the commission that, because of his impaired hearing, he cannot make his way in the work-a-day world. Lamont v. Aetna Bridge Co., 107 R.I. 686, 270 A.2d 515, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 825 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Benefits paid under this section are intended to compensate an injured worker for the loss of a specific member or sense rather than for the impairment of earning capacity caused by the loss. Walsh v. Department of Natural Resources, 120 R.I. 367, 388 A.2d 8, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 681 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Legislative Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the legislature considered the use of glasses to relieve the impairment of sight and made no mention of the reduction of a loss of hearing by the use of a hearing aid, the Supreme Court concludes that the legislature intended that specific compensation be awarded a workman for the complete loss of his hearing even though the hearing can be restored with the aid of a hearing aid. Lamont v. Aetna Bridge Co., 107 R.I. 686, 270 A.2d 515, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 825 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an employee’s petition for specific compensation, where he suffered a permanent loss of the use of both legs as a result of an injury to the spinal cord, there was no legislative intent to limit the benefits of this section to the infliction of direct trauma to the affected member, nor was there any intention that this section be read with § 28-33-17(e) as the two sections were irreconcilable and stood alone. Thibault v. Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., 111 R.I. 381, 302 A.2d 755, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1214 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Loss of Function of Member.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Loss of piece of bone from side of thumb and loss of tendons and flesh, leaving claimant able to rotate thumb and to press it against other fingers but only lightly, was not equivalent to an amputation. Weber v. American Silk Spinning Co., 38 R.I. 309, 95 A. 603, 1915 R.I. LEXIS 69 (1915).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Compensation could not be awarded under this section for bodily member rendered only partially useless. Vick v. Aubin, 73 R.I. 508, 58 A.2d 109, 1948 R.I. LEXIS 23 (1948); Steele v. Darlington Fabrics Corp., 78 R.I. 272, 81 A.2d 424, 1951 R.I. LEXIS 70 (1951) (decisions on facts arising prior to 1947 and 1954 amendments).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Employee was not entitled to compensation for thumb that had become useless because of loss of other four fingers and part of hand where the thumb itself was not stiff. Walsh v. C. J. Fox Co., 76 R.I. 345, 70 A.2d 37, 1949 R.I. LEXIS 120 (1949) (decision on facts arising prior to 1947 and 1954 amendments).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Decree denying compensation for a stiff and useless member could not be based on speculation that certain treatment might restore its use. Serrecchia v. Atlantic Mills, 79 R.I. 242, 87 A.2d 419, 1952 R.I. LEXIS 37 (1952).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “stiff ” is to be given its ordinary meaning and it is not required that the member be also useless. Landry v. Cornell Constr. Co., 87 R.I. 1, 137 A.2d 410, 1957 R.I. LEXIS 134 (1957).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>On appeal from part of decree denying specific compensation for loss of the left hand due to the necessity to surgically fuse a wrist to give it more stability and ease the pain after it had failed to unite after fracture, the court held whether the wrist is considered as a portion of the bodily member or a bodily member in and of itself, that the legislature had made no provision for an award of specific compensation for the loss of a wrist by reason of stiffness rendering it useless. Pearson v. Seaboard Constr. Co., 88 R.I. 345, 148 A.2d 270, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 12 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If permanent loss of usefulness of a hand or hands can be established, it is immaterial whether the wrists or either of them are involved. Tirocchi v. United States Rubber Co., 101 R.I. 429, 224 A.2d 387, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 411 (1966).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The degree of permanent uselessness of an employee’s member will be determined as of the time when remedial surgery shall be reasonably considered to have achieved the maximum possible amelioration of the condition rather than as of the date of the injury. Fogarty v. State, 103 R.I. 228, 236 A.2d 247, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 603 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Loss of Hearing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where employee sought specific compensation for total loss of hearing in his left ear and the trial commissioner found that the employee had failed to prove that his hearing loss was due to “external trauma” connected with his employment, compensation was denied. Beaupre v. Dynachem Corp., 113 R.I. 612, 324 A.2d 621, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1216 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Specific compensation is to be given for the loss of use of the power or sense of hearing rather than for an injury to the physical structure of the ear, and such benefits are to be paid only in a case where there has been a complete loss of hearing. Lamont v. Aetna Bridge Co., 107 R.I. 686, 270 A.2d 515, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 825 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Loss of Leg.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial judge’s disfigurement award of 140 total weeks of compensation was highly inadequate in light of subsection (a)(14)(B), which affords the judge the discretion to award up to 500 weeks of benefits, especially where the trial judge assessed compensation for the subsequent, secondary amputation at 15 weeks, approximately eight times less than the value of the initial award for originally crushed limbs. Johnson v. State, 634 A.2d 863, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 262 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Loss of Sight.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a national guardsman lost an eye while on duty and received from the United States regular army pay, subsistence, quarters allowance, medical and surgical treatment, and hospitalization, the state was not entitled to credit for such federal payments against the specific loss payments under subsection (d) of this section. Coletta v. State, 106 R.I. 764, 263 A.2d 681, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 986 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A worker who suffered an eye injury in the course of employment, but whose vision was correctable to 90 percent of normal with a contact lens and glasses was not entitled to recovery on a claim under subdivision (d) of this section. Walsh v. Department of Natural Resources, 120 R.I. 367, 388 A.2d 8, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 681 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If an employee suffers injury which results in loss of a part of the eye but suffers no loss or reduction of sight, he would not be entitled to compensation under subdivision (d) of this section. Walsh v. Department of Natural Resources, 120 R.I. 367, 388 A.2d 8, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 681 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The term “glasses” in subdivision (d) of this section includes contact lenses where the lenses perform the same function as eyeglasses. Walsh v. Department of Natural Resources, 120 R.I. 367, 388 A.2d 8, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 681 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A clear legislative intent exists to account for losses of vision under subsections (a)(1) and (a)(4) of this section, and the term “bodily member” in subsection (a)(13) cannot be applied to visual losses. Anderson v. O'Connell Supply, 649 A.2d 509, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 245 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Employee who lost sight of one eye in accident was entitled to compensation for only one eye even though the sight of the other eye had been lost previously. In re J. &amp; P. Coats, 41 R.I. 289, 103 A. 833, 1918 R.I. LEXIS 44 (1918).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Decree awarding compensation was not defective for want of an express finding that loss of sight was permanent where there was evidence that loss was permanent. Marszalkowski v. Rusakovich, 84 R.I. 302, 124 A.2d 244, 1956 R.I. LEXIS 70 (1956).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Decree awarding compensation for loss of sight of one eye should specify the eye involved. Marszalkowski v. Rusakovich, 84 R.I. 302, 124 A.2d 244, 1956 R.I. LEXIS 70 (1956).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Notice of Injury.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where notice of original injury was given under § 28-33-30, no additional notice was required where subsequent condition developed from injury 15 years later for which claim was made under this section. Fontaine v. Gorfine, 105 R.I. 174, 250 A.2d 361, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 735 (1969).</p>

In making this computation, absence for seven (7) consecutive calendar days, although not in the same calendar week, shall be considered as absence for a calendar week. When the employment commenced otherwise than the beginning of a calendar week, the calendar week and wages earned during that week shall be excluded in making the above computation. When the employment previous to injury as provided above is computed to be less than a net period of two (2) calendar weeks, his or her weekly wage shall be considered to be equivalent to the average weekly wage prevailing in the same or similar employment at the time of injury except that when an employer has agreed to pay a certain hourly wage to the worker, then the hourly wage so agreed upon shall be the hourly wage for the injured worker and his or her average weekly wage shall be computed by multiplying that hourly wage by the number of weekly hours scheduled for full-time work by full-time employees regularly employed by the employer. Where the injured employee has worked for more than one employer during the thirteen (13) weeks immediately preceding his or her injury, his or her average weekly wages shall be calculated upon the basis of wages earned from all those employers in the period involved by totaling the gross earnings from all the employers and dividing by the number of weeks in which he or she was actually employed by any employer, in the same manner as if the employee had worked for a single employer and, except in the case of apportionment of liability among successive employers as provided in § 28-34-8, the employer in whose employ the injury was sustained shall be liable for all benefits provided by chapters 29 — 38 of this title. A schedule of the computation of the average weekly wage in compliance with this section shall be a necessary part of the memorandum of agreement required by § 28-35-1. Where the employer has been accustomed to paying the employee a sum to cover any special expense incurred by the employee by the nature of his or her employment, the sum paid shall not be reckoned as part of the employee’s wages, earnings, or salary. The fact that an employee has suffered a previous injury or received compensation for a previous injury shall not preclude compensation for a later injury or for death; but in determining the compensation for the later injury or death, his or her average weekly wages shall be any sum that will reasonably represent his or her weekly earning capacity at the time of the later injury, in the employment in which he or she was working at that time, and shall be arrived at according to, and subject to the limitations of, the provisions of this section.

<p class="p7"><b>Purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislative intent of this section is to provide the employee with an equitable formula for the calculation of benefits while providing a safeguard for the employer against the possibility of excessive claims brought by a newly hired employee. Smith v. Colonial Knife Co., 731 A.2d 724, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 144 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Bonus.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A payment in the nature of a bonus, if proven, will be includable in computing the employee’s average weekly wage. Sullivan v. Empire Equip. Eng'g Co., 492 A.2d 1212, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 506 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Petitioner failed to meet burden of proving the amount and existence of her husband’s supplemental wages where the only evidence introduced were receipts that did not delineate the husband’s profits or earnings, and the petitioner did not introduce her husband’s applicable income tax records. Gardiner v. Arrow Lake Dairy, 476 A.2d 526, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 530 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Calculations.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Appellate Division acted properly in conducting a de novo review and in modifying the trial court’s calculation on the grounds that the trial court was clearly erroneous in not following the method for computation of wages set forth in this section but instead relying on the petitioner’s own testimony. Forte v. Fernando Originals, 667 A.2d 780, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 279 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was substantial medical evidence in the record to allow the appellate division to determine that an occupational disease arose in the course of the plaintiff’s employment, and where there was an involuntary hiatus in his employment immediately prior to his incapacitation, there was no error in the court’s construction of the workers’ compensation statute to provide that the average weekly wage could be calculated on the basis of the amount the plaintiff earned during the thirteen weeks immediately preceding the last day of his employment. Lambert v. Stanley Bostitch, Inc., 723 A.2d 777, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 49 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Holiday Pay.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Holiday pay should be included in the calculation of gross wages, since to exclude it would precipitate an inequitable result for the employee who incurs injuries at work during or immediately after a holiday season. Smith v. Colonial Knife Co., 731 A.2d 724, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 144 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Multiple Employers.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not make a specific recommendation for computing the average weekly wage where there has been more than one employer and where the employee has worked at neither job for the statutory period. McCormick v. Ice Cream Mach. Co., 442 A.2d 433, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1164 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, during 13 weeks prior to injury, employee worked for two employers, but not for entire 13 weeks in either job, there was no error in computing the employee’s average weekly wage by adding together his average weekly wage while at each job. McCormick v. Ice Cream Mach. Co., 442 A.2d 433, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1164 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Other Employment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Earnings received from unrelated work for a second employer cannot be included in computation of compensation. De Asis v. Fram Corp., 78 R.I. 249, 81 A.2d 280, 1951 R.I. LEXIS 67 (1951).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Overtime.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is nothing in the law that would justify the exclusion of overtime from the calculations of an injured worker’s weekly wage. McKenna v. Turnquist Lumber Co., 511 A.2d 298, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 507 (R.I. 1986) (decided prior to 1992 amendment).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Prior to the 1992 amendment pay for overtime work was properly included in ascertaining the average weekly wages of an injured employee, but the 1992 amendment specifically excludes from the calculation of an injured employee’s average weekly wages “overtime pay,” without distinguishing between mandatory as opposed to voluntary overtime pay. Silva v. Stanley-Bostitch, 651 A.2d 1222, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 277 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Part-Time Employees.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Worker’s Compensation Court erred when it calculated the wages of an insured part-time employee by multiplying the employee’s hourly wage by the number of weekly hours scheduled for full-time employees. A more effective interpretation of the legislative intent behind this section to compensate the insured part-time employee adequately and fairly would be to calculate her average wage on the basis of her actual wages, as evidenced by the record. Bailey v. American Stores, 610 A.2d 117, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 164 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A part-time employee is entitled to have his average weekly wage computed at forty times his hourly rate even though it results in his receiving compensation in excess of his weekly earnings prior to his injury. Gamba v. Testa's Auto Body Works, 103 R.I. 366, 238 A.2d 618, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 804 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Period of Earnings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court was not clearly wrong in basing computation of average earnings on three-month period rather than full year. Johnson v. Lanifero, 73 R.I. 238, 54 A.2d 412, 1947 R.I. LEXIS 80 (1947).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Formula used by commission in determining average weekly wage by taking the average of the weekly wages earned in the four weeks next before being disabled although during part of such time she was employed at a different type of work than at the time of the injury, was not contrary to the law. Shoren v. United States Rubber Co., 87 R.I. 319, 140 A.2d 768, 1958 R.I. LEXIS 59 (1958).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An employee of a carnival who received each week seven dollars for setting up the rides and seven dollars for taking them down without evidence as to the average amount of time consumed in each operation was not entitled to have his average weekly wage computed at forty times the state minimum wage of $1.25. McCrudden v. Venditto Bros., 103 R.I. 201, 235 A.2d 878, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 599 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It would have been inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the workers’ compensation statute to conclude that, because the statute did not specifically provide for the situation where an eighteen-year employee involuntarily failed to earn a weekly wage for the thirteen weeks prior to his incapacitation, his claim failed. Lambert v. Stanley Bostitch, Inc., 723 A.2d 777, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 49 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Stipulations.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Issue of whether or not an employee was a full-time or a part-time employee was not open for consideration because the employee’s stipulation that he was a part-time employee was clearly a factual assertion; as such, the employee was bound by that stipulation. Powers v. Warwick Pub. Schs, 204 A.3d 1078, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the stipulation as to an employee having received “unemployment compensation benefits” was a legal conclusion to which the Supreme Court was not bound, its analysis and conclusions were not influenced by the employee having stipulated to receiving unemployment compensation benefits. Powers v. Warwick Pub. Schs, 204 A.3d 1078, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Tips.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Tips received by an employee working less than a full week should be projected to a full 40-hour week as a part of the computation of a full week’s earnings. Larochelle v. Hickory House, 80 R.I. 334, 96 A.2d 830, 1953 R.I. LEXIS 72 (1953).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Work-Sharing Benefits.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Determination as to whether or not work-sharing benefits are akin to unemployment compensation benefits and should or should not be taken into account when determining a worker’s average weekly wage is a question of statutory construction, and questions of statutory construction are questions of law. Powers v. Warwick Pub. Schs, 204 A.3d 1078, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Appellate Division of the Workers’ Compensation Court (WCC) properly affirmed the decision of the trial judge of the WCC, which found that work-sharing benefits were properly not included in an employee’s average weekly wage; work-sharing benefits cannot be taken into account when determining the average weekly wage to be used in calculating workers’ compensation benefits. Powers v. Warwick Pub. Schs, 204 A.3d 1078, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is not clear and unambiguous because the statute itself is silent as to whether or not work-sharing benefits are part and parcel of the term “wages”; the commonsense understanding of the term “wages” and an examination of the broader statutory schemes lead to the definite conclusion that this section was not intended to take work-sharing benefits into consideration in determining average weekly wage for workers’ compensation purposes. Powers v. Warwick Pub. Schs, 204 A.3d 1078, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Taking into account the definition of “wage” from a respected source, as well as the meaning given to the word “wage” in common parlance, the word refers to payment for labor or services rendered; work-sharing benefits are the antithesis of monies paid for hours worked and are by definition monies paid for hours not worked, and they are monies paid by the state, not by the employer. Powers v. Warwick Pub. Schs, 204 A.3d 1078, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In view of the fact that work-sharing benefits are monies paid by the State for hours not worked, they align with traditional unemployment compensation benefits, which are likewise paid to an individual by the state during times when he or she is not working; work-sharing benefits should be treated like traditional unemployment compensation benefits. Powers v. Warwick Pub. Schs, 204 A.3d 1078, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is apparent from the broader statutory schemes that work-sharing benefits, at least in the context of this case, are to be treated like traditional unemployment compensation and should not be included in determining average weekly wage for workers’ compensation; such benefits are not included as part of the term “wages” in this section. Powers v. Warwick Pub. Schs, 204 A.3d 1078, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2019).</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">No compensation shall be payable for an occupational disease if the employee, at the time of entering into the employment of the employer by whom the compensation would otherwise be payable, or thereafter, willfully and falsely represents in writing that he or she has not previously had the disease which is the cause of the disability or death. Where an occupational disease is aggravated by any other disease or infirmity, not itself compensable, or where disability or death from any other cause, not itself compensable, is aggravated, prolonged, accelerated, or in any way contributed to by an occupational disease, the compensation payable shall be the proportion only of the compensation that would be payable if the occupational disease were the sole cause of the disability or death as that occupational disease, as a causative factor, bears to all the causes of that disability or death, the reduction in compensation to be effected by reducing the number of weekly payments or the amounts of the payments, as under the circumstances of the particular case may be for the best interests of the claimant or claimants.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Employer cannot be justly charged with the obligation to pay all of the petitioner’s medical and hospital expenses regardless of whether such expenses include treatment of other ailments not compensable under the statute, and in the absence of statute guidance the court was of the opinion that justice to the parties will be more nearly approximated if such expenses are apportioned in the same manner as compensation, in other words, employer paying for 50% of the cost. Shurick v. Ames Am. Co., 96 R.I. 181, 190 A.2d 217, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 68 (1963).</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The total compensation due shall be recovered from the employer who last employed the employee in the employment to the nature of which the disease was due and in which it was contracted. If, however, the disease was contracted while the employee was in the employment of a prior employer, the employer who is made liable for the total compensation as provided by this section may petition the workers’ compensation court for an apportionment of the compensation among the several employers who since the contraction of the disease have employed the employee in the employment to the nature of which the disease was due. The apportionment shall be proportioned to the time the employee was employed in the service of the employers and shall be determined only after a hearing, notice of the time and place of which shall have been given to every employer alleged to be liable for any portion of the compensation. If the court finds that any portion of the compensation is payable by an employer prior to the employer who is made liable for the total compensation as provided by this section, it shall make an award accordingly in favor of the last employer, and that award may be enforced in the same manner as an award for compensation.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Liability Despite Previous Compensation.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Made Liable.”</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Primary Liability of Last Employer.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This provision serves two purposes in that it provides for monetary assistance to a qualified employee in a speedy manner and also provides for successive hearings, if necessary, to apportion liability among the potentially liable employers. American Power Conversion v. Benny's, Inc., 740 A.2d 1265, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 211 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Liability Despite Previous Compensation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Previous employer is not excused from liability under this section by fact that he made payments during previous period of disability in the absence of evidence that the disease was completely cured after the first disability. Esmond Mills v. American Woolen Co., 76 R.I. 214, 68 A.2d 920, 1949 R.I. LEXIS 106 (1949).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>“Made Liable.”</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The “made liable” language of this section contemplates the possible use of a memorandum of agreement to make the last employer liable for the total compensation due to a disabled employee because of an occupational disease, but does not contain mandatory language requiring the workers’ compensation court to adjudicate liability before the last employer will be deemed “made liable.” American Power Conversion v. Benny's, Inc., 740 A.2d 1265, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 211 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Manifestation of Condition.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In order for a disease to be contracted while in the employ of a prior employer it is not necessary that there should have been a symptomatic manifestation of the disease or a disabling effect while employed by such prior employer. Morgan v. Stillman White Foundry Co., 87 R.I. 408, 142 A.2d 536, 1958 R.I. LEXIS 74 (1958).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Primary Liability of Last Employer.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The remedy given by this section indicates that employer could be held primarily liable if employment contributed to disease even though the disease originated in previous employment. Gosselin v. Parker Brass Foundry, 83 R.I. 463, 119 A.2d 189, 1955 R.I. LEXIS 85 (1955).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In cases involving disability because of occupational diseases incurred while working for multiple employers, the employer is liable either if (a) the employee’s work with the last employer caused an aggravation of the prior condition or (b) the last employment (no matter how brief) was of the same nature and type in which the disease was first contracted, regardless of whether the last employment aggravated the prior condition. Tavares v. A.C. &amp; S., Inc., 462 A.2d 977, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1025 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The employee does not have to prove that he contracted the disease at the last place of employment. Tavares v. A.C. &amp; S., Inc., 462 A.2d 977, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1025 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fact that an employee worked as a welder at employer one, just as he had at employers two and three, was not enough to hold employer one liable to pay benefits for his occupational disease as his “last employer” under R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-34-8; he did not contract mesothelioma because he was a welder, but because the conditions in which he was welding exposed him to asbestos. Gallagher v. Nat'l Grid USA, 44 A.3d 743, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 71 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As employee who contracted mesothelioma unequivocally testified that he was exposed to asbestos while working for employers two and three, while his testimony about his exposure while working for employer one was mere speculation, the Workers’ Compensation Court’s decree finding employer one liable as the “last employer” under R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-34-8 was properly vacated. Gallagher v. Nat'l Grid USA, 44 A.3d 743, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 71 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an employee testified that he was exposed to asbestos while working for his last employer, the Appellate Division of the Workers’ Compensation Court did not erroneously find the testimony inadmissible under R.I. R. Evid. due to his lack of personal knowledge of the matter; rather, it found his testimony speculative and not probative on the issue of whether the conditions while working for the employer were of the same type or nature in which he first contracted the disease. Gallagher v. Nat'l Grid USA, 44 A.3d 743, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 71 (R.I. 2012).</p>

The requirements as to notice as to occupational disease and death resulting from it and the requirements as to the bringing of proceedings for compensation for disability or death resulting from the occupational disease shall be the same as required in chapter 33 of this title, except that the notice shall be given to the employer within ninety (90) days after disablement.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The “made liable” language of § 28-34-8 contemplates the possible use of a memorandum of agreement to make the last employer liable for the total compensation due to a disabled employee because of an occupational disease, but does not contain mandatory language requiring the workers’ compensation court to adjudicate liability before the last employer will be deemed “made liable.” American Power Conversion v.

<p class="p7"><b>Director’s Approval Mandatory.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where agreement to suspend workers’ compensation benefits was in conformity with all requirements of law and was duly filed with department of labor but lacked approval by director of labor, agreement was to be given full effect since language of § 28-35-3 [repealed] that director “shall so approve” such agreements was mandatory.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where eleven days after her injury an employee entered into a compensation agreement which described her injuries as “undisplaced fractures — last sacral and first coccygeal segments” and it subsequently developed that she had a ruptured disc by which her nerve roots had been irritated, the commission did not err in amending the agreement to include the term “back injury” in the description of her injuries. United States Rubber Co. v. Curis, 101 R.I. 627, 226 A.2d 410, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 811 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An employee must be allowed to petition to amend a memorandum of agreement (MOA) without any limitations period if the purpose of such a petition is merely to include in the MOA another part of the body that was injured at the same time as the injury specified therein but which was omitted from the MOA for any of the specified reasons. Ponte v. Malina Co., 745 A.2d 127, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 13 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once an amendment to a memorandum of agreement (MOA) is granted for any reason set forth in this section, an employee may be awarded compensation benefits retroactively based upon that later-included injury only if the claim or issue is not precluded because of res judicata or collateral estoppel as those doctrines are applied in workers’ compensation cases, the employee proves by a fair preponderance of the credible evidence that he is incapacitated based upon an injury described in the amended MOA as of a specific date, and the retroactive compensation claim is filed within the limitations period.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an employer was mistaken as to the number of dependents an employee had, and the employee misunderstood the legal effect in worker’s compensation cases of having dependents, such misunderstanding or lack of awareness of the law is a mistake of law rather than of fact, thus, no mutual mistake of fact as ground for appeal existed.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a petition by employer to the commission for a review of a preliminary agreement which established the employee’s average weekly wage to determine compensation, this section not only provided the commission with authority to review erroneous computations of the average weekly wage but also gave them jurisdiction to order a correction of any error, and there was no legislative intent to limit the scope of review of such an agreement which had been approved by the director of labor to those where there was an allegation that the agreement had been procured by fraud, coercion or mutual mistake. Damiano Bros. Welding Co. v. Poulos, 111 R.I. 539, 304 A.2d 889, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1242 (1973).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An employer was justified in refusing to pay compensation and medical expenses by the employee’s refusal to sign an agreement without altering it to include an injury for which the employer was not liable, as the subsequent award of such compensation and medical expense by the commission might have forced the employer to pay such items twice.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where employer continued to pay employee his regular salary during periods of disability when he was unable to work, the court ruled that employee’s earning capacity had in fact been diminished and the salary payments were deemed a gratuity rather than “compensation” within the meaning of this section.

<p class="p7"><b>Consideration of Previous Injuries.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The proximity in time between first and second disabilities is a relevant factor in deciding whether the first injury was a material contributing cause or a substantial factor in causing the second injury, and because it is only one factor to be considered, even a great distance in time between injuries will not preclude a finding that one was causally related to the other.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the evidence at a hearing was squarely in conflict on the issue of the causal connection between the disability and the employment connected accident and the commission failed to appoint an impartial medical examiner, the court held that the authority granted by this section is purely discretionary and the commission did not abuse its discretion in failing to appoint an examiner.

Within any time that a judge shall fix, either by an original fixing or otherwise, the appellant shall file with the court reasons of appeal stating specifically all matters determined adversely to him or her which he or she desires to appeal, together with so much of the transcript of testimony and rulings as he or she deems pertinent, and within ten (10) days after that the parties may file with the court those briefs and memoranda that they may desire concerning the appeal. The chief judge shall appoint appellate panels of three (3) members of the court to hear any claim of appeal and the decision of the appellate panel shall be binding on the court. The three (3) members of the appellate panel shall immediately review the decree upon the record of the case and shall file a decision pursuant to the law and the fair preponderance of the evidence within ten (10) days of the expiration of the time within which the parties may file briefs and memoranda. Upon consideration of the appeal, the appellate panel shall affirm, reverse, or modify the decree appealed from, and may itself take any further proceedings that are just, or may remand the matter to the trial judge for further consideration of any factual issue that the appellate division may raise, including the taking of additional evidence or testimony by the trial judge. It shall be within the prerogative of the appellate panel to remand a matter to the trial judge. If the decision requires the entry of a new decree, notice shall be given the parties, and the new decree shall be entered in the same manner as the original decree, but if the decision of two (2) appellate panel judges does not require the entry of a new decree, the decree shall be affirmed. Any member of the appellate panel may, for cause, disqualify himself or herself from hearing any appeal that may come before the appellate panel.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The findings of the trial judge on factual matters shall be final unless an appellate panel finds them to be clearly erroneous. The court may award costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees, to the prevailing party when the appellate panel finds there was complete absence of a justiciable issue of either law or fact.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Appeal was properly before the supreme court for the purpose of determining whether there was any legal evidence to support the findings that the medical bills in question were reasonable since the main contention on appeal was that the decree appealed from was not supported by legal evidence and that it was therefore against law, it being well settled that findings of fact which are not supported by legal evidence amount to errors of law and will be reviewed by the supreme court upon appeal.

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section gives costs to the employee in certain circumstances but in no circumstances to the employer, and the court held that this was not an improper classification, and that there was no improper or unreasonable inequality of treatment of employers and employees since the employers were treated alike and all employees were treated alike; and that, while the two groups were treated differently, it is because, generally speaking, they are different. Gomes v. Bristol Mfg. Corp., 95 R.I. 126, 184 A.2d 787, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 131 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whether an employee has successfully prosecuted or defended such action is a question to be determined in the first instance by the respective tribunals in each case, therefore, the petitioner’s contention of unconstitutionality on the ground of lack of discretion of the respective tribunals was without merit. Drake Bakeries v. Butler, 95 R.I. 143, 185 A.2d 108, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 136 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction With Other Sections.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although an action was commenced by the filing of an employer’s notice of intention to discontinue, suspend or reduce payments under former § 28-35-46, the proceeding is in substance an employer’s petition to review respondent’s capacity to work and was so treated by this court. Drake Bakeries v. Butler, 95 R.I. 143, 185 A.2d 108, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 136 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the title of a statute may be used as a guide and considered to aid construction but cannot control or vary the meaning of a statute where that statute is unambiguous, a substantive right, in this instance the right to recover costs under this section cannot be defined as procedural within the meaning of the last sentence of § 28-33-8 simply because it falls within that chapter of the act entitled “Procedure.” Orthopedic Specialists v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., 120 R.I. 378, 388 A.2d 352, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 688 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Counsel Fees.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was nothing in the record to show that the question of counsel fees was in issue before the single commissioner or that any ruling had been made thereon the issue was not properly before the supreme court. Trotta v. General Elec. Co., 86 R.I. 254, 134 A.2d 177, 1957 R.I. LEXIS 100 (1957).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is to be emphasized that the final determination of the amount of an attorney’s fee lies with the court. Gomes v. Bristol Mfg. Corp., 95 R.I. 126, 184 A.2d 787, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 131 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provision that the counsel fee be assessed consistently with the services performed before each tribunal confers discretion upon the tribunal in which the litigation terminated to remand, in appropriate cases to a subordinate tribunal for assessment of a fee consistent with the services therein performed. Capaldi v. Liberty Tool &amp; Gage Works, 99 R.I. 236, 206 A.2d 639, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 423 (1965).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By providing in this section for the payment by an employer of a fee to the attorney of an employee who has successfully defended in whole or in part an employer’s petition to review, the general assembly has effectively forestalled any undue harassment of an employee that might occur by an employer’s persistent and indiscriminate filing of petitions to renew. Kleistone Rubber Co. v. Roderick, 101 R.I. 606, 225 A.2d 792, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 807 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An employee who failed to raise the question of counsel fees before the trial commissioner or the full commission is precluded from raising the question in the supreme court, but may move for an award of fees for the services performed by his counsel in that court. Cabral v. Hall, 102 R.I. 320, 230 A.2d 250, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 689 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As chapter 35 of title 28 refers to both accidents and occupational diseases the authority contained herein to pay counsel fees and fees of expert medical witnesses applies to occupational disease cases. Andrade v. Mintell, 102 R.I. 148, 229 A.2d 50, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 660 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the statutory right to recover costs such as counsel and witness fees does not exist at common law, the rights provided are exclusive to the class of persons to whom granted, and may not be extended to any other class of persons not specifically included. Orthopedic Specialists v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., 120 R.I. 378, 388 A.2d 352, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 688 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mere stipulation by an employer early in the hearing before the trial commissioner that its insurance carrier would pay certain bills was not a successful prosecution of a petition within the reasonable intendment of this section so as to warrant the award of counsel fees to the employee. Mastronardi v. Zayre Corp., 120 R.I. 859, 391 A.2d 112, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 734 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Amount.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Award of costs by superior court would not be reviewed in the absence of an abuse of discretion. Gomes v. John J. Orr &amp; Son, 78 R.I. 96, 79 A.2d 618, 1951 R.I. LEXIS 41 (1951); Ferguson v. George A. Fuller Co., 78 R.I. 412, 82 A.2d 856, 1951 R.I. LEXIS 94 (1951).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute is addressed to the sound judicial discretion of the single commissioner, the full commission on appeal and the supreme court on appeal to award the costs and fix the amount thereof according to the merits and circumstances of the particular case before each of the tribunals. Drake Bakeries v. Butler, 95 R.I. 143, 185 A.2d 108, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 136 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the court believed the more orderly procedure would be better served by disposing of the question of costs, including counsel fees, prior to the entry of a decree by respective tribunals, there is nothing in the statute depriving this court of jurisdiction to hear and determine the motion to assess costs for the services of respondent’s attorney after the entry of the decree in question. Drake Bakeries v. Butler, 95 R.I. 143, 185 A.2d 108, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 136 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Five hundred dollars was a reasonable fee for attorneys who spent a total of 35 hours in a trial before a single commissioner and in the briefing and arguing of their contentions first before the full commission and then before the supreme court in connection with an employee’s petition for $275.00 for the medical services of three physicians, where the court disallowed the claims for two physicians and allowed $45.50 for the third. Palumbo v. United States Rubber Co., 102 R.I. 220, 229 A.2d 620, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 674 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining a fair and reasonable counsel fee chargeable as costs against the employer the fee should not in all events be proportionate to the amount involved or a fixed percentage of the amount recovered nor based solely on the time spent by counsel, but the court will consider all the elements which properly enter into the fee-setting process, giving each such weight as may be appropriate to the peculiar circumstances of the case. Palumbo v. United States Rubber Co., 102 R.I. 220, 229 A.2d 620, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 674 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If counsel for an employee looks to an assessment of a fee that is reasonably commensurate with the services performed, he has the burden of making known to the tribunal before whom he appears the extent and nature of the work involved in preparation. Hassenfeld Bros. v. Wolowicz, 104 R.I. 620, 247 A.2d 834, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 695 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Award of $50 counsel fee to employee’s attorney for work involving two hearings before single commission and $50 for appeal to full commission was so unreasonable as to be arbitrary, notwithstanding such attorney had submitted no evidence as to the amount of time spent on case. Hassenfeld Bros. v. Wolowicz, 104 R.I. 620, 247 A.2d 834, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 695 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The elements to be considered in the fee setting process include the amount in issue, the questions of law involved (whether they are unique or novel), the hours worked and the diligence displayed, the result obtained, and the experience, standing, and ability of the attorney who rendered the services. Each of these factors is important, but no one is controlling. Annunziata v. ITT Royal Elec. Co., 479 A.2d 743, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 598 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial judge’s conclusory statement that she “reviewed the counsel fee affidavit in accordance with the provisions of Annunizata [sic],” and her consideration of the degree of success achieved by counsel in prosecuting the employee’s original petition, did not show that she properly exercised her discretion in setting the counsel fee. Fallon v. Skin Med. &amp; Surgery Ctrs., 713 A.2d 777, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 211 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Award Improper.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The awarding of petitioner’s request for an expert medical witness was not within any of the categories for which the successful prosecution of a petition would entitle the petitioner to a counsel fee within the reasonable intendment of the statute. Picozzi v. Nugent, 99 R.I. 398, 208 A.2d 99, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 452 (1965).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, on an employer’s petition to review a consent decree awarding an employee compensation for total disability, the commission found that the employee was no longer totally incapacitated and reduced his compensation from $40 a week to $22 a week, the employee was not entitled to counsel fees and expert witness’ fees for his defense of such petition. Litchman v. Atlantic Tubing &amp; Rubber Co., 100 R.I. 352, 216 A.2d 129, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 440 (1966).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, an attorney, after a partial success in an appeal from the workers’ compensation commission to the Supreme Court, accepted a fee from his client, he cannot be awarded a fee for his services in the Supreme Court, but will be entitled to a fee for his services before the commission and trial commissioner. Tirocchi v. United States Rubber Co., 102 R.I. 617, 232 A.2d 593, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 737 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An employee was not entitled to attorney’s fees where the commission’s award was only of that which the employer had offered to pay voluntarily. Peloquin v. ITT Gen. Controls, 104 R.I. 257, 243 A.2d 754, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 642 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Award of fees and costs was inappropriate, even though an employee succeeded in having a summary dismissal of an appeal quashed, where the dismissal was set aside only as unduly harsh, but not because the Appellate Division had acted illegally in dismissing, since the employee’s failure to comply with statutory and rules of procedure in preparing the appeal could be grounds for such a dismissal. Impulse Packaging, Inc. v. Sicajan, 869 A.2d 593, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 57 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Award Proper.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Construction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The language employed by the legislature in the P.L. 1960, ch. 94 amendment clearly demonstrates that the legislature intended to remedy the circumstances in both § 28-34-4 which specified the time for filing claims for compensation resulting from occupational diseases and in this section for injuries which penalized the incapacitated employee who had no reasonable knowledge that the incapacitating disease or injury was causally connected with his employment, otherwise the phrase of the amendment “including disease” would be rendered meaningless since the time for bringing a suit for compensation resulting from an occupational disease was controlled only by § 28-34-4. Britto v. Fram Corp., 93 R.I. 426, 176 A.2d 81, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 125 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is properly construed not as a technical statute of limitation but as a statute of repose — the limitation is an express condition of the right to compensation and is intended to bar the claim or right to compensation unless its provisions are complied with; thus the failure of an employee to file a timely claim or to show that the statute of limitations was tolled barred him from recovering compensation despite the fact that the employer did not plead the defense affirmatively. Ochoa v. Union Camp Corp., 120 R.I. 898, 391 A.2d 123, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 736 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Abatement of Previous Action.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section 9-1-22, providing a new period of limitations after abatement of an action, does not apply to workers’ compensation proceedings so as to permit a petition after abatement of a common-law action. Menna v. Mathewson, 48 R.I. 310, 137 A. 907, 1927 R.I. LEXIS 88 (1927).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Application to Second Injury Fund.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The two-years’ limitation prescribed in this section is an indispensable condition of the right to benefits created by § 28-37-10 and not a mere limitation on the remedy. De Costa v. Devine, 90 R.I. 240, 157 A.2d 247, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 5 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Claim Not Barred.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Employee’s claim for disability from exposure to a noxious gas in 1979 was not barred or otherwise affected by the fact that she did not file a claim for disabilities that occurred from exposure to the gas in earlier years. Souza v. Raytheon Co., 490 A.2d 500, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 484 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Commencement of Period.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Period of limitations on claim for loss of earning capacity begins to run at the time employee is first incapacitated rather than at the time of the accident. Rosa v. George A. Fuller Co., 74 R.I. 215, 60 A.2d 150, 1948 R.I. LEXIS 68 (1948); Chicoria v. Kenyon Piece Dyeworks, 74 R.I. 260, 60 A.2d 492, 1948 R.I. LEXIS 80 (1948); Gagne v. Weintraub's Silk &amp; Fabric Shops, Inc., 80 R.I. 498, 98 A.2d 854, 1953 R.I. LEXIS 103 (1953).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Period of limitations on claim for compensation under § 28-33-19 begins to run at the time the member first becomes so useless as to give rise to a claim under that section, rather than at the time of the accident. Larkin v. George A. Fuller Co., 76 R.I. 395, 71 A.2d 690, 1950 R.I. LEXIS 12 (1950).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>First period of incapacity from accident starts the period of limitations and bars a petition filed more than two years thereafter even though the first period is of short duration and gives no indication of serious nature of injury. Cruso v. Yellow Cab. Co., 82 R.I. 158, 106 A.2d 734, 1954 R.I. LEXIS 26 (1954).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If it appears from the record before the full board that the manifestation of injury is proved by competent legal evidence it shall be conclusive on appeal and a claim filed within two years of such manifestation is timely. Girard v. United States Rubber Co., 85 R.I. 477, 132 A.2d 831, 1957 R.I. LEXIS 47 (1957).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute of limitations begins to run not from the time of the injury but from the date total disability resulting from a compensable injury is determined, either by an agreement entered into between the employer and the employee or by a final decree of the commission. Silva v. Devine, 90 R.I. 120, 155 A.2d 605, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 125 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where petitioner testified that he was reading lips for more than five years and doctor testified that petitioner had a total loss of hearing for five to ten years petition seeking compensation for loss of hearing was too late. Lozowski v. Nicholson File Co., 92 R.I. 270, 168 A.2d 143, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 23 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Petitioner’s claim for compensation was timely filed when it was filed as soon as petitioner knew his condition was directly attributable to his employment. Britto v. Fram Corp., 93 R.I. 426, 176 A.2d 81, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 125 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Involved in the determination of the time when the statute begins to run against a claim for permanent partial impairment are such conditions as the extent of the healing of scar tissues, improvement of circulation, reasonable minimum tenderness, not to mention such damage to the sensory nerves as time may prove to the irreparable. Tirocchi v. United States Rubber Co., 101 R.I. 429, 224 A.2d 387, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 411 (1966).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an employee suffered injury to both hands eventually requiring amputation of three fingers from the right hand and four from the left, followed by experiments with plastic surgery, cosmetic hands, and prosthetic devices, the statute began to run at the time that it was sound medical opinion that, independent of prosthetic devices, post-surgery functional development could objectively be said to have reached its potential. Tirocchi v. United States Rubber Co., 101 R.I. 429, 224 A.2d 387, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 411 (1966).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an accident to an employee occurred January 22, 1952, resultant epileptic seizures began to occur in August, 1952, a physician advised the employee in September, 1960, that his epilepsy was probably caused by the accident, and in September, 1961, after a pneumoencephalogram which the employee had failed to have made a year before, the physician advised him that his epilepsy had been caused by the accident, a petition for compensation filed January 9, 1963, was not filed within the time provided therefor in this section. Rastella v. Department of Pub. Works, 102 R.I. 123, 229 A.2d 43, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 656 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A petition for dependency filed more than two years after the petitioner had ceased to receive payments was barred by this section. Moniz v. Hall, 102 R.I. 398, 230 A.2d 840, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 702 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where employee burned hand on X-ray machine in 1947 and later had to have part of thumb amputated in 1957, and then several years later lost 25 per cent use of her hand, she came within two-year statute of limitation of this section for specific benefits where post surgery loss of use of hand can objectively be said to have reached its potential in such period. Fontaine v. Gorfine, 105 R.I. 174, 250 A.2d 361, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 735 (1969).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an employee received head injuries more than a year apart and, more than two years later, upon recurrence of his disability, a myelogram revealed a ruptured disk between the fifth and sixth vertebrae, the limitation period of this section did not begin to run until the employee was advised by the report of the myelogram of the true nature of his injury. Provencher v. Glas-Kraft, Inc., 107 R.I. 97, 264 A.2d 916, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 744 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the employer’s insurer through error continued compensation payments to a worker beyond the maximum period for which benefits were payable, the statute of limitations on the employee’s claim for further payment from the second injury fund began to run from the date of the last payment received and not from the date the maximum amount due had been paid. Church v. Doherty, 107 R.I. 432, 267 A.2d 693, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 791 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where employee sustained “tear of rotator cuff left shoulder” on May 12, 1964 in an industrial accident and physician testified that such condition reached a plateau in not less than one year and not more than 18 months subsequent to original injury and trial commissioner on that basis found the condition of the employee’s arm became permanent on or about January 1, 1966, and that the employee’s right of action for specific benefits arose at that time, said employee failed to sustain his burden of proving that he had filed the March 11, 1970 petition within two years of the time he knew or “by exercise of reasonable diligence should have known” that the condition of his shoulder was permanent and of its causal relationship to his employment. Auclair v. American Silk Spinning Co., 109 R.I. 395, 286 A.2d 253, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 1198 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claimant must have known or by exercise of reasonable diligence should have known of his disability, and he is considered aware if, as a reasonable man, he would have believed that he was afflicted due to work related injury, before statute of limitations begins to run. McCaughey v. Geigy Chem. Corp., 116 R.I. 672, 360 A.2d 561, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1323 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute of limitations begins to run upon the end result of permanent disability and the end result is reached when sound medical opinion could conclude that any improvement from treatment had reached its potential. McCaughey v. Geigy Chem. Corp., 116 R.I. 672, 360 A.2d 561, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1323 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claimant’s disfigurement petition, filed three years after amputation of an arm but within one year of an unsuccessful operation to excise painful nerve tissue from the stump, was not barred by the statute of limitations, as the time for filing such a petition runs from the final treatment for the restoration of the disfigured claimant’s psychological self-image rather than from the date of amputation. Jones v. Grinnell Corp., 117 R.I. 144, 362 A.2d 139 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A reasonable person, when informed by physicians of a probable causal relationship between an injury and his employment, may be charged with knowledge of that casual relationship; and claimant’s petition was properly dismissed where claimant was so informed in January, 1972, but did not file her petition until March, 1974. Boudreau v. American Luggage Works, 117 R.I. 548, 368 A.2d 1189, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1725 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The filing of a claim within the limitation period did not render the statutory bar ineffective as to related claims for dependents’ benefits which were filed subsequent to the running of the statutory period. Yates v. Dr. J. H. Ladd Sch., 120 R.I. 294, 387 A.2d 1043, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 671 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claim that the limitation period of this section was tolled for a claim for benefits for minor children under § 28-33-17 was held not to be before the court where the petition for review was filed neither by the employee’s children nor by a legal guardian acting in their behalf but rather by the employee herself in her own name. Yates v. Dr. J. H. Ladd Sch., 120 R.I. 294, 387 A.2d 1043, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 671 (1978); Vieira v. Davol, Inc., 120 R.I. 944, 392 A.2d 375, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 742 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of requiring claims to be brought within a specific time limit is to protect the employer from stale claims too old to be successfully or adequately investigated and properly defended, and this objective is not satisfied merely by giving notice to an employer of a claim against it. Ochoa v. Union Camp Corp., 120 R.I. 898, 391 A.2d 123, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 736 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As to statutes of limitations, a dismissal without prejudice leaves the parties as if the action had never been brought; for example, the complaining party must file his claim in a timely manner without regard to his previous claim, and if the second claim is subject to a statute of limitations it must be filed within the time set by that statute or be barred. Ochoa v. Union Camp Corp., 120 R.I. 898, 391 A.2d 123, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 736 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where period of time for which compensation payments could be made expired at a time when claimant was not totally incapacitated, period of limitations did not begin to run until claimant again became totally incapacitated from the same injury. Healy v. De Sano, 121 R.I. 325, 397 A.2d 1328, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1781 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where physician testified that injured employee’s disabling and disfiguring impairments had reached end result at such time as to place his claim filing beyond the limitation period, appellate division of Workers’ Compensation Commission was not justified in vacating award of benefits absent a further showing that employee knew or should have known that end result had been reached. Rainville v. King's Trucking Co., 448 A.2d 733, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 973 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Payments Under Federal Act.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Payments voluntarily made by an employer under the Federal Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act (LHWCA) tolled the statute of limitations for filing a petition under this chapter until the date of the last LHWCA payment. Young v. General Dynamics, 494 A.2d 100, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 532 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Preliminary Agreement.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The entry into a preliminary agreement in respect to compensation for incapacity did not have any effect upon and did not toll the statute of limitations in respect to the filing of a claim for disfigurement and loss of use. Carter v. Lang Jewelry Co., 492 A.2d 1231, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 516 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Computation of Benefits.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that this section prevents the statute of limitations from running until claimant has learned that he has received a compensable injury does not permit claimant to have benefits based on law in force at time extent of injury was learned rather than at time of accident. Harding v. Rhode Island Hosp., 110 R.I. 89, 290 A.2d 406, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 882 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Once an amendment to a memorandum of agreement (MOA) is granted for any reason set forth in § 28-35-5 an employee may be awarded compensation benefits retroactively based upon that later-included injury only if the claim or issue is not precluded because of res judicata or collateral estoppel as those doctrines are applied in workers’ compensation cases, the employee proves by a fair preponderance of the credible evidence that he is incapacitated based upon an injury described in the amended MOA as of a specific date, and the retroactive compensation claim is filed within the limitations period. Ponte v. Malina Co., 745 A.2d 127, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 13 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an employee alleged that a memorandum of agreement (MOA) should be amended to include an additional original injury, he was required to do so within the limitations period to obtain any additional benefits that might be due from such a disabling injury retroactive to the date of the MOA, since otherwise benefits were payable, if at all, only from the date of a proven recurrence of his disability after the MOA had been amended to include that omitted injury. Ponte v. Malina Co., 745 A.2d 127, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 13 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction With Other Laws.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because § 28-35-61 is not a statute of limitation, the applicable statute for determining the timeliness of an original claim for workers’ compensation benefits is § 28-35-57, and the trial court erred in holding that the plaintiff was required to file a petition to change the nature and location of the injuries set forth in the pretrial order within six months of the date of entry. Brooks v. Dockside Seafood, 740 A.2d 1277, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 220 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Effect of Prior Agreement.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Petition of one dependent was, for the purposes of this section, independent of an agreement with another dependent, even though the agreement referred to and saved any right that the first dependent might have. Giannotti v. Giusti Bros., 41 R.I. 122, 102 A. 887, 1918 R.I. LEXIS 17 (1918).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Petition for partial incapacity payments after period of total incapacity covered by agreement was for the purposes of this section a petition to review, so was not barred by this section, even though designated and referred to as an original petition. Balon v. General Cable Corp., 76 R.I. 206, 68 A.2d 44, 1949 R.I. LEXIS 86 (1949).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Estoppel to Assert Statute.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Insurer which, both before and after expiration of the period of limitations, required employee to submit to physical examinations but did not either disclaim liability nor show willingness to settle despite numerous conferences was estopped from asserting statute of limitations. Shea v. Gamco, Inc., 81 R.I. 12, 98 A.2d 864, 1953 R.I. LEXIS 3 (1953).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Employer which made payments all during the period of limitations as if an agreement had been filed, but which did not obtain or file an agreement, was estopped from asserting the statute of limitations. Baligian v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 80 R.I. 49, 81 R.I. 49, 98 A.2d 830, 1953 R.I. LEXIS 10 (1953).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An employer who continued an injured employee’s full salary and provided him with all necessary medical services during the entire period of his disability was not estopped to assert the statute against a claim filed within a few weeks after the termination of his employment but more than three years after the termination of his disability. Trzoniec v. General Controls Co., 100 R.I. 448, 216 A.2d 886, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 458 (1966); Aragao v. American Emery Wheel Works, 453 A.2d 762, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 1119 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Mental Incapacity.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Epilepsy was not such mental incapacity as to extend the period of limitations where attacks were not continuous and claimant was otherwise competent. Dunn v. United Lace &amp; Braid Mfg. Co., 164 A. 329, 1933 R.I. LEXIS 160 (R.I. 1933).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Physician’s Claim.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although this section does not specifically apply to a physician’s direct claim against the employer, equity requires the application of the same period of limitations where proceedings are brought in equity under the act. Henry v. American Enamel Co., 48 R.I. 113, 136 A. 3, 1927 R.I. LEXIS 21 (1927).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Retroactive Application.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The 1978 amendment to this section changing the statute of limitations for filing petitions from two to three years cannot be applied retroactively. Emmett v. Coventry, 478 A.2d 571, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 577 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no evidence that the Legislature sought to give retroactive effect to the 1978 amendment to this section that changed the two-year limitation to a three-year limitation. Donahue v. Washburn Wire Co., 492 A.2d 152, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 504 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Second Injuries Arising From Same Incident.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If an original injury is different from the one specified in a decree or in a memorandum of agreement and does not “flow from” the original injury, even though this different injury also arises from the same work-related activity or accident, § 28-35-45 is inapplicable, and a second original petition must be filed within the limitations period set forth in this section. Ponte v. Malina Co., 745 A.2d 127, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 13 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>What Constitutes Agreement.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The filing of an agreement sufficient to comply with this section is the filing with the director of labor of a memorandum of an agreement between the parties and signed by them. Gomes v. Bristol Mfg. Corp., 94 R.I. 500, 182 A.2d 318, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 112 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a preliminary agreement designated “nonprejudicial three month agreement” and a suspension agreement for periods of incapacity were submitted to the director of labor, these constituted the filing of a memorandum of agreement within the purview of § 28-35-1, and since the director had no authority to decline to docket such a memorandum the fact that such agreements were returned to the employer, with the notation “these agreements cannot be approved” was a nullity, and such submission of the memorandum constituted a compliance with the provisions of this section so that employee was not barred from claiming compensation. Gomes v. Bristol Mfg. Corp., 94 R.I. 500, 182 A.2d 318, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 112 (1962).</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Where the injury for which compensation is payable under chapters 29 — 38 of this title was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the employer to pay damages in respect of the injury, the employee may take proceedings, both against that person to recover damages and against any person liable to pay compensation under those chapters for that compensation, and the employee shall be entitled to receive both damages and compensation. The employee, in recovering damages either by judgment or settlement from the person so liable to pay damages, shall reimburse the person by whom the compensation was paid to the extent of the compensation paid as of the date of the judgment or settlement and the receipt of those damages by the employee shall not bar future compensation. An insurer shall be entitled to suspend the payment of compensation benefits payable to the employee when the damages recovered by judgment or settlement from the person so liable to pay damages exceeds the compensation paid as of the date of the judgment or settlement. The suspension paid shall be that number of weeks which are equal to the excess damages paid divided by the employee’s weekly compensation rate; however, during the period of suspension the employee shall be entitled to receive the benefit of all medical and hospital payments on his or her behalf. If the employee has been paid compensation under those chapters, the person by whom the compensation was paid shall be entitled to indemnity from the person liable to pay damages, and to the extent of that indemnity shall be subrogated to the rights of the employee to recover those damages. When money has been recovered either by judgment or by settlement by an employee from the person liable to pay damages, by suit or settlement, and the employee is required to reimburse the person by whom the compensation was paid, the employee or his or her attorney shall be entitled to withhold from the amount to be reimbursed that proportion of the costs, witness expenses, and other out-of-pocket expenses and attorney fees which the amount which the employee is required to reimburse the person by whom compensation was paid bears to the amount recovered from the third party.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> In any case in which the employee or, in case of death, the administrator of the employee’s estate neglects to exercise the employee’s right of action by failing to file a lawsuit against such third person within two (2) years and eight (8) months after the injury, the self-insured employer or the employer’s insurance carrier may so proceed and shall be subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or, in case of death, to the rights of the administrator to recover against such person; provided, that no subrogation action shall commence unless at least twenty-six (26) weeks prior to the expiration of the two (2) years and eight (8) months the self-insured employer or the employer’s insurance carrier has notified the employee or in the case of death, the administrator of the employee’s estate, in writing by personal service or certified mail, that failure to commence such action within two (2) years and eight (8) months after the injury will operate as an assignment of the right of action to the self-insured employer or the employer’s insurance carrier. Upon filing the lawsuit the attorney for the self-insured employer or the employer’s insurance carrier shall notify the employee in writing by personal service or certified mail of the action and the name of the court where it was filed and the employee may join as a plaintiff in the action within thirty days after the notification, and, if the employee fails to join, the right of joinder shall abate. The right of the employee, or in case of death, the administrator of the employee’s estate, to be fully compensated for the damages sustained shall be fully preserved as outlined in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> If the self-insured employer or the employer’s insurance carrier recovers from these other personal damages or benefits, after expenses and costs of action have been paid, in excess of the amount of the lien as defined in this section, then that excess shall be paid to the injured employee or, in the case of death, to the administrator of the employee’s estate for distribution.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is clear from the provision in R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Throughout the act the words “employer” and “insurer” are used interchangeably, thus denoting an equating of the two; hence the employer’s compensation insurer cannot be “some person other than the employer” and liable in tort to the employee for damages for negligence in voluntarily making safety inspections of the employer’s machinery and plant.

<p class="p7"><b>Authority of Commission.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While this section is remedial in nature and affords a wide latitude to the commission to amend a final decree where the full nature and extent of the injury sustained is not accurately and completely set forth and described, its latitudinous nature is not so broad as to permit relitigation of issues raised and determined at a prior proceeding under the guise of a statutory petition to amend. Luzzi v. Imondi, 97 R.I. 463, 198 A.2d 671, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 106 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Incorrect Statement of Injuries.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, in a hearing on an employee’s petition to amend a consent decree to include a back injury, the employee gave contradictory testimony as to how his back injury occurred, it was not error for the commission to deny such petition and to find that the petitioner had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the decree did not accurately and correctly set forth all injuries received. Litchman v. Atlantic Tubing &amp; Rubber Co., 100 R.I. 352, 216 A.2d 129, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 440 (1966).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, on a petition describing the employee’s injuries as being to her “back and right hip,” the commission found that her injuries were to her “right arm and right buttock” and subsequently she was found to have a “ruptured disc at the fourth lumbar space on the right,” it was not error for the commission, on petition, to amend the decree by adding a finding of the ruptured disc. O'Neil v. M &amp; F Worsted Mills, 100 R.I. 647, 218 A.2d 666, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 492 (1966).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is clear that, rather than a statute of limitation or repose, this section is more in the nature of a vehicle of convenience for the court and the parties in its provision of a mechanism for the workers’ compensation court to amend a decree that misdescribes, misstates, or omits any injury suffered by the employee. Brooks v. Dockside Seafood, 740 A.2d 1277, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 220 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Timeliness.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because § 28-35-61 is not a statute of limitation, the applicable statute for determining the timeliness of an original claim for workers’ compensation benefits is § 28-35-57, and the trial court erred in holding that the plaintiff was required to file a petition to change the nature and location of the injuries set forth in the pretrial order within six months of the date of entry.

The statutory language did not require an insurer whose policy excluded coverage for Massachusetts injuries to pay benefits solely because the claim was filed in Rhode Island.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Any employer required to secure the payment of compensation under chapters 29 — 38 of this title who knowingly fails to secure that compensation shall be guilty of a felony and shall be subject to imprisonment for up to two (2) years. In addition to the foregoing, the employer shall be subject to a civil penalty punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each day of noncompliance with the requirements of this title. The director shall institute any and all reasonable measures to comprehensively monitor, investigate, and otherwise discover all employer noncompliance with this section and shall establish rules and regulations governing these measures. Each day shall constitute a separate and distinct offense for calculation of the penalty. Where that employer is a corporation, the president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and other officers of the corporation shall be severally liable for the fine, penalty or imprisonment as provided in this section for the failure of that corporation to secure the payment of compensation. The president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and other officers of the corporation shall also be severally personally liable, jointly with the corporation for any compensation or other benefit that may accrue under those chapters in respect to any injury that may occur to any employee of that corporation while it fails to secure the payment of compensation as required by those chapters.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Where the employer is a limited-liability company, the managers and managing members who knowingly fail to secure the payment of compensation under chapters 29 — 38 of this title shall be guilty of a felony and shall be subject to imprisonment for up to two (2) years. The managers and managing members shall also be severally liable for the fine, penalty, or imprisonment as provided in this section for the failure of that company to secure the payment of compensation. The managers and managing members shall be severally personally liable, jointly with the company, for any compensation or other benefit that may accrue under those chapters in respect to any injury that may occur to any employee of that company while it fails to secure the payment of compensation as required by those chapters.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Where the employer is a partnership, or a registered limited-liability partnership, the partners who knowingly fail to secure the payment of compensation under chapters 29 — 38 of this title shall be guilty of a felony and shall be subject to imprisonment for up to two (2) years. The partners shall also be severally liable for the fine, penalty, or imprisonment as provided in this section for the failure of that partnership to secure the payment of compensation.

<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Where the employer is a limited partnership or a registered limited-liability limited partnership, the general partners who knowingly fail to secure the payment of compensation under chapters 29 — 38 of this title shall be guilty of a felony and shall be subject to imprisonment for up to two (2) years. The general partners shall also be severally liable for the fine, penalty, or imprisonment as provided in this section for the failure of that limited partnership to secure the payment of compensation. The general partners shall be severally personally liable, jointly with the limited partnership, for any compensation or other benefit that may accrue under those chapters in respect to any injury that may occur to any employee of that partnership while it fails to secure the payment of compensation as required by those chapters.</p>

<p class="p6">The court shall consider the following factors in assessing a civil penalty: gravity of offense; resources of the employer; effect of the penalty on employees of the company; the reason for the lapse in coverage; and the recommendation of the director. Following a review of the factors set forth above, the court may suspend all or a part of a civil penalty or shall establish a time table for compliance with any court order.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(f) (1)</b> As soon as practicable after the director receives notice of noncompliance under this section, the director shall determine whether cause exists for the imposition of a civil penalty. Unless the director determines that the noncompliance was unintentional or the result of a clerical error and subject to the administrative proceedings under subsection (g) of this section, the director shall commence an action in the workers’ compensation court to assess a civil penalty against the employer as set forth in subsection (a) of this section and shall refer the matter to the attorney general for prosecution of criminal charges.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> In the case of unintentional noncompliance or noncompliance resulting from clerical error where the uninsured period is less than one year from the date of discovery and there were no employees injured during the uninsured period and the employer has not been subject to any other findings of noncompliance with these chapters, the director shall assess an administrative penalty of not less than the estimated annual workers’ compensation insurance premium for that employer and not more than triple that amount. Any party has the right to appeal the orders of the director. The appeal shall be to the workers’ compensation court in the first instance and thereafter from the workers’ compensation court to the Rhode Island supreme court in accordance with § 28-35-30.</p>

The director shall lift the suspension upon receipt of satisfactory proof of insurance and evidence sufficient to satisfy the director that the employer is in full compliance with these chapters.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Upon the filing of a claim, the director shall promptly examine the claim and on the basis of facts found by the director and records maintained by the department, the claim shall be determined to be valid or invalid. If the claim is determined to be valid, the director shall promptly notify the claimant as to the week with respect to which benefits shall commence, the weekly benefit amount payable, and the maximum duration of those benefits. If the claim is determined to be invalid, the director shall likewise notify the claimant and any other interested parties of that determination and the reasons for it. If the processing of the claim is delayed for any reason, the director shall notify the claimant, in writing, within three (3) weeks of the date the application for benefits is filed of the reason for the delay. Unless the claimant or any other interested party, within fifteen (15) days, requests a hearing before the board of review, the determination with reference to the claim is final. However, for good cause shown the fifteen (15) day period may be extended after notification by the director has been mailed to his or her last known address, as provided in this section. At any time within one year from the date of a monetary determination, the director, upon request of the claimant or on his or her own motion, may reconsider his or her determination if he or she finds that an error in computation or identity has occurred in connection with it or that additional wages pertinent to the claimant’s status have become available, or if that determination has been made as a result of a nondisclosure or misrepresentation of a material fact.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> If an appeal is duly filed, benefits with respect to the period prior to the final decision, if it is found that those benefits are payable, shall be paid only after the decision. If an appeal tribunal affirms a decision of the director, or the board of review affirms a decision of an appeal tribunal allowing benefits, those benefits shall be paid regardless of any appeal which may subsequently be taken.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">Economic insecurity, due to unemployment, being a serious menace to the health, morale, and general welfare of the people of this state, is, therefore, a subject of interest and concern to the community as a whole, warranting appropriate action by the general assembly to prevent its spread and to lighten the burden which now falls on the unemployed worker and his or her family. According to the report of the joint special commission appointed pursuant to the joint resolutions, the evidence seems conclusive that in the face of recurring periods of business depression, which industry and commerce appear powerless to prevent, the industrial worker’s position is extremely insecure. The individual is as incapable of protecting himself or herself against unemployment, as industry is of preventing it. Experience has shown that if the state delays action until unemployment becomes excessive, it can neither promptly create the organizations necessary to orderly, economical, and effective relief, nor bear the financial burden of relief without disrupting its whole system of ordinary revenues and jeopardizing its credit. Chapters 42 — 44 of this title are designed to meet in some measure this situation by providing for the accumulation of a fund to assist in protecting the public against the ill effects of unemployment which may arise in future years.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Federal Preemption.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court of appeals reversed a federal district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction which would forbid the state from paying striking workers unemployment compensation, holding that the question of whether federal labor policy preempted the state statute was justiciable and that the court should resolve the issue.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was neither the intent nor the primary purpose of this statute to impinge upon federally established collective bargaining rights and payment of unemployment benefits to striking workers cannot be enjoined on the theory that such payment would have the effect of reallocating the balance of power in such bargaining as contemplated by the National Labor Relations Act.

That successor shall, if not already an employer prior to that acquisition, become an employer on the date of that acquisition, and for the purpose of determining experience rates of employer contributions the director shall hereafter consider those prior payroll records of the predecessor as the payroll records of the successor, and the successor shall assume the position of the predecessor or predecessors with respect to the payroll records of the predecessor or predecessors as if there had been no change in the ownership of the organization, trade, separate establishment, business, or assets. If the successor is an employer prior to the time of the transfer, it may continue to pay employer contributions at the rate applicable to it from the date the transfer occurred until the end of the then current tax year, or it may elect to pay at the rate applicable to its predecessor for the balance of that year. If the successor is not an employer prior to the time of the transfer, it shall pay employer contributions at the rate applicable to the predecessor or, if more than one and the same rate is applicable to both, the rate applicable to the predecessor or predecessors from the date the transfer occurred until the end of the then current tax year. If the successor is not an employer prior to the time of the transfer and simultaneously acquires the businesses of two (2) or more employers to whom different rates of employer contributions are applicable, it shall pay employer contributions at the highest rate applicable to those predecessors from the date transfers occurred until the end of the then current tax year.</p>

As used in this section, “successor” means the employing unit to whom a transfer as provided in this section is made, and “predecessor” means the employer making the transfer and may, if the context so requires, be construed as referring only to the separate establishment transferred in case of the transfer of a separate establishment.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">Notwithstanding any other provisions of chapters 42 — 44 of this title, the following shall apply regarding assignment of rates and transfers of experience:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> If an employer transfers its trade or business, or a portion thereof, to another employer and, at the time of the transfer, there is any common ownership, management, or control of the two (2) employers, then the unemployment experience attributable to the transferred trade or business shall be transferred to the employer to whom such business is so transferred. Furthermore, partial transfers may be made in the absence of common ownership at the discretion of the director.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In determining whether there is any common ownership, management or control, the department may consider the following factors, which include, but are not limited to: any familial relationships, principals or corporate officers, organizational structure, day-to-day operations, assets and liabilities, and stated business purposes. The rates of both employers shall be recalculated in the following manner:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The total payroll of the employees on the predecessor’s payroll during the last, completed calendar quarter prior to the date of the transfer, who are also on the payroll of the successor when the transfer takes effect shall be divided by the predecessor’s total payroll during the last, completed calendar quarter prior to the date of the transfer, and that percentage shall be applied to the experience rating balances and payroll of the predecessor as of the end of the experience year used to determine the contribution rate for the tax year in effect at the date of transfer. The resulting amounts shall be subtracted from the experience-rating balances and payroll of the predecessor. The predecessor’s remaining experience-rating balances and payroll shall be used to determine its contribution rate for the new tax year or for the remainder of the current tax year, whichever is applicable, effective on the first day of the calendar quarter following the date of the transfer; provided, that if the date of the transfer is the first day of the calendar quarter, then the new contribution rate shall take effect on the date of the transfer.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The balances, subtracted from the predecessor’s account in subdivision (a)(1) of this section, shall be combined with the experience-rating balances and payroll of the successors as of the end of the experience year used to determine the contribution rate for the tax year in effect at the date of transfer. Those combined balances shall be used to determine the contribution rate for the successor for the new tax year, or for the remainder of the current tax year, whichever is applicable, effective on the first day of the calendar quarter following the date of the transfer; provided, that if the date of the transfer is the first day of the calendar quarter, then the new contribution rate shall take effect on the date of the transfer. For successors in business for less than one experience year, their contribution rate for the new tax year, or for the remainder of the current tax year, whichever is applicable, shall be computed based on the transferred experience rating balances and payroll of the predecessor and shall take effect on the first day of the calendar quarter following the date of the transfer; provided, that if the date of the transfer is the first day of the calendar quarter, then the new contribution rate shall take effect on the date of the transfer.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> A successor shall be deemed to be an eligible employer if its experience combined with that of its predecessors meets the requirements of § 28-43-1(3). As used in this section, “successor” means the employing unit to whom a transfer as provided in this section is made, and “predecessor” means the employer making the transfer and may, if the context so requires, be construed as referring only to the separate establishment transferred in case of the transfer of a separate establishment.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> If, following a transfer of experience under subsection (a) of this section, the director determines that a substantial purpose of the transfer of the trade or business was to obtain a reduced liability for contributions, then the experience-rating accounts of the employers involved shall be combined and the combined rate assigned to each employer account.</p>

Instead, such person shall be assigned the new employer rate under § 28-43-8.3. In determining whether the business was acquired solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions, the director shall use objective factors that may include the cost of acquiring the business, whether the person continued the business enterprise of the acquired business, how long such business enterprise was continued, or whether a substantial number of new employees were hired for performance of duties unrelated to the business activity conducted prior to the acquisition.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(d)</b> Subject to the provisions herein, whenever a person who is not an employer under this chapter at the time that person acquires the trade or business, or a portion thereof, of an employer in insolvency proceedings, including federal bankruptcy courts, state receiverships, masterships, or other insolvency proceedings, the unemployment experience of the acquired business shall not be transferred to such person. Instead, such person shall be assigned the new employer rate under § 28-43-8.3 unless the director finds that, at the time of the acquisition, there is common ownership, management, or control of the two (2) employers, and in such case all of the experience will be transferred.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(e)</b> Subject to the provisions herein, whenever a person who is an eligible employer prior to the time that person acquires the trade or business, or a portion thereof, of an employer in solvency proceeding(s) including federal bankruptcy courts, state receiverships, mastership, or other insolvency proceedings, the unemployment experience of the acquired business shall not be transferred to such person. Instead, such person shall continue to pay employer contributions at the rate applicable to it prior to the date it made such acquisition unless the director finds that, at the time of the acquisition, there is common ownership, management, or control of the two (2) employers, and in such case, all of the experience will be transferred and a new rate computed.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Payment of unemployment benefits to striking workers under this section cannot be enjoined on the theory that such payment would have the effect of reallocating the balance of power in collective bargaining negotiations as contemplated by the National Labor Relations Act. Almacs, Inc. v. Hackett, 312 F. Supp. 964 (D.R.I. 1970), but see Grinnell Corp. v. Hackett, noted below.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court of appeals reversed a federal district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction which would forbid the state from paying striking workers unemployment compensation, holding that the question of whether federal labor policy preempted the state statute was justiciable and that the court should resolve the issue.

<p class="p7"><b>Evidence Upholds Finding of Lockout.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An actual physical lockout of union employees took place, within the meaning of subsection (b), where gates were chain locked and barricaded, the entrance to an employee parking lot was blocked off, and the windows of the building where negotiations had taken place were boarded up.

<p class="p7"><b>Interest to Be Protected.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determining whether there was a compelling state interest in providing unemployment compensation for strikers after the extra six-week waiting period, a court should have considered what interest was being protected, whether this interest was the same as its interest in welfare, and whether the state interest was served by the secondary economic and social effects of unemployment payments or their absence. Grinnell Corp. v. Hackett, 475 F.2d 449, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 11089 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 858, 94 S. Ct. 164, 38 L.

<p class="p7"><b>Preemption by Federal Statutes.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section of the unemployment compensation statute imposed an additional six-week waiting period for striking claimants, and the question of whether it was preempted by federal labor statutes was a complex but justiciable issue.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To recover under this section an employee must leave both for good cause and voluntarily. Kane v. Women &amp; Infants Hosp., 592 A.2d 137, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 117 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Finding of director of department of employment security that under this section employee was disqualified from receiving benefits because he had left his work voluntarily without good cause was sustained on appeal, the petitioner’s contentions to the contrary that pushing a cart was not part of his job being without merit. Whitelaw v. Board of Review, 95 R.I. 154, 185 A.2d 104, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 134 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Good Cause.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In order for the individual to have left work voluntarily “for good cause” it is not necessary that the termination be of a compelling nature. Harraka v. Board of Review, 98 R.I. 197, 200 A.2d 595, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 150 (1964).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Petitioner did not have good cause for voluntarily quitting his job; where petitioner had voluntarily terminated after only one day, not by reason of job unsuitability or inability to perform the work, but because his assignment was to drive a truck rather than to deliver mail; and because he was disgruntled when his automobile, parked on employer’s premises, was blocked. Cahoone v. Board of Review, 104 R.I. 503, 246 A.2d 213, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 672 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where petitioner resigned from his job as public relations director after refusing to prepare a dishonest press release as he was ordered to do by his boss, and such a release would have severely and permanently damaged his credibility with the media, the petitioner’s resignation was necessary in order for him to continue to pursue his career in public relations; therefore, the petitioner resigned for good cause and was entitled to unemployment benefits. Powell v. Department of Employment Secur., Bd. of Review, 477 A.2d 93, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 538 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An employee is deemed to leave for good cause when the employee is faced with sufficiently adverse circumstances that are beyond that employee’s control. Kane v. Women &amp; Infants Hosp., 592 A.2d 137, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 117 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An employee who voluntarily terminates employment to accompany their spouse to another state for relocation purposes has terminated for good cause under this section and is thereby entitled to employment security benefits.

<p class="p7"><b>Leaving Voluntarily.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Eligibility for benefit payments is not to be forfeited because termination of employment was voluntary but only, if being voluntary, it was without good cause.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where 12 employees, although not belonging to a labor union, stayed away from work by common consent to compel the employer to redress alleged grievances, they were engaged in a strike and not subject to penalty of this section.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where claimant leaves voluntarily and without good cause from his base period employer in his benefit year after already having had drawn unemployment compensation for two weeks in his benefit year, and where he works for another employer in his benefit year for six weeks before he is laid off, and then seeks benefits, they will not be charged to his base period employer’s account but would be paid from the solvency fund.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Determination of mixed questions of law and fact by the Board of Review of the Department of Employment Security that an employee had voluntarily left his position of employment without good cause and was therefore not entitled to employment compensation benefits was not clearly wrong since the employee had failed to provide sufficient evidence that he left his job due to the effect of employer’s false accusations of wrongdoing on employee’s health, where doctor did not advise the employee to leave his job.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The record did not support the conclusion that the plaintiff was discharged for misconduct even though the plaintiff was forced to resign rather than be terminated based on negligible discrepancies between timecard records and actual work time, since the plaintiff was never warned that these discrepancies were erosive of the plaintiff’s employee status.

<p class="p7"><b>“Discharge” Defined.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As used in this section, the term “discharge” refers to the type of deliberate dismissal of an employee that results in the immediate termination of that employee’s ongoing employment obligations. St. Pius X Parish Corp. v. Murray, 557 A.2d 1214, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 74 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A Catholic school’s nonrenewal of a lay teacher’s one-year contract after it learned that she intended to marry outside the church does not amount to a “discharge” as contemplated by this section.

<p class="p7"><b>Misconduct.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Misconduct is limited to conduct evincing such willful or wanton disregard of an employer’s interests as is found in deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of his employee, or in carelessness or negligence of such degree or recurrence as to manifest equal culpability, wrongful intent or evil design, or to show an intentional and substantial disregard of the employer’s interests or of the employee’s duties and obligations to his employer. On the other hand mere inefficiency, unsatisfactory conduct, failure in good performance as the result of inability or incapacity, inadvertencies or ordinary negligence in isolated instances, or good faith errors in judgment or discretion are not to be deemed “misconduct” within the meaning of this section. Turner v. Department of Employment Sec., Bd. of Review, 479 A.2d 740, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 591 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A lay teacher’s marriage and her announcement to her students that she would not be returning to her position at a Catholic school and that she intended to marry outside the church does not constitute the type of misconduct contemplated by this section.

Consequently, the decision of the Unemployment Compensation Board granting compensation was clearly erroneous in view of the substantial, reliable and undisputed evidence on the record.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Clerical and secretarial employees who had been employed for lengthy periods on a 52-week basis and had been provided with very little notice were entitled to unemployment benefits for the contested summer period, since the employees were not subject to the “between terms” disqualifying language of subsection (1) given that reasonable assurance of work, present only if the economic terms and conditions of the job offered are not substantially less than those for the job as a full-time employee, did not exist.

<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The evidence supported the Board of Review’s denial of unemployment benefits to plaintiff school teachers, where the board found that plaintiffs were given reasonable assurances of employment in that they were informed by letter that the school department expected to rehire them in the upcoming year, and where they were also reassured by information concerning vacancies and job prospects.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Lay teacher who was hired to work as a teacher in a Catholic school for one year and was notified that her employment contract would not be renewed for the following academic year is without “reasonable assurance” that she is able to “perform services in any such capacity for any educational institution” and is entitled to benefits under this section.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As there was no showing of bad faith by the employer, or reason to question sincerity of the “reasonable assurance” letter it sent a per diem substitute teacher, she was provided with reasonable assurance of continued employment under R.I.

The plain and ordinary meaning of the term “institution,” as used in subdivision (4), dictates that bus drivers and monitors be included within the scope of this section. Delicato v.

<p class="p7"><b>Workers’ Compensation Average Weekly Wage.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Appellate Division of the Workers’ Compensation Court (WCC) properly affirmed the decision of the trial judge of the WCC, which found that work-sharing benefits were properly not included in an employee’s average weekly wage; work-sharing benefits cannot be taken into account when determining the average weekly wage to be used in calculating workers’ compensation benefits. Powers v. Warwick Pub. Schs, 204 A.3d 1078, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Taking into account the definition of “wage” from a respected source, as well as the meaning given to the word “wage” in common parlance, the word to refers to payment for labor or services rendered; work-sharing benefits are the antithesis of monies paid for hours worked and are by definition monies paid for hours not worked, and they are monies paid by the State, not by the employer. Powers v. Warwick Pub. Schs, 204 A.3d 1078, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In view of the fact that work-sharing benefits are monies paid by the state for hours not worked, they align with traditional unemployment compensation benefits, which are likewise paid to an individual by the state during times when he or she is not working; work-sharing benefits should be treated like traditional unemployment compensation benefits. Powers v. Warwick Pub. Schs, 204 A.3d 1078, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is apparent from the broader statutory schemes that work-sharing benefits are to be treated like traditional unemployment compensation and should not be included in determining average weekly wage for workers’ compensation; such benefits are not included as part of the term “wages” in R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-33-20. Powers v. Warwick Pub. Schs, 204 A.3d 1078, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 50 (R.I. 2019).</p>

<p class="p6">The director annually, as soon as practicable after April first in each succeeding year, shall ascertain the total amount of expenses, including in addition to the direct costs of personal services, the cost of maintenance and operation, the cost of retirement contributions made and workers’ compensation premiums paid by the state for or on account of personnel, rentals for space occupied in state owned or state leased buildings, and all other direct or indirect costs incurred by the department of business regulation during the preceding calendar year in carrying out the provisions of this chapter. Those expenses shall be assessed against all group self-insurers including for this purpose employers who have ceased to exercise the privilege of group self-insurance but have filed a surety bond, trust fund, or other security. The basis of apportionment of the assessment against each group shall be that proportion of those expenses, excluding any expenses associated with a disbanded group, that the written premium or equivalent premium of each group self-insurer at the close of the preceding calendar year bears to the total premium for all group self-insurers. The department may assess any disbanded group based upon the actual expenses incurred by the department for such group in the preceding fiscal year. For the purpose of this assessment, a “disbanded group” means a group in run-off. All those assessments when collected shall be paid to and for the use of the insurance division of the department of business regulation.</p>

The evidence showed that his demotion was in response to his attendance problems that had been occurring for over a two-year period only to culminate in two incidents of not reporting for work for two days, and that he was demoted soon after the second incident.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">WHEREAS, The system of workers’ compensation in the state of Rhode Island was once in a state of acute crisis until legislative intervention and oversight produced what is now a nationally recognized model of a well-managed economical program that provides injured workers with appropriate compensation, health care, and rehabilitative services without unduly burdening employers, insurers, and the citizens of Rhode Island; and</p>
<p class="p6">WHEREAS, Legislative and policy changes have corrected the abuses and misuse of the workers’ compensation system while assisting injured workers, restoring fiscal stability, and eliminating waste and unnecessary costs; and</p>
<p class="p6">WHEREAS, Professionals providing services covered under the provisions of the workers’ compensation act have taken into account, in the performance of their service, the important public policy benefit of a sound and properly functioning workers’ compensation system in this state, and have tirelessly committed themselves to protect and maintain the integrity of this system; and</p>
<p class="p6">WHEREAS, Abuse and misuse of the workers’ compensation system by noncomplying employers has been reduced through the state’s mandatory requirement that employers subject to the law either self-insure or maintain a policy of workers’ compensation insurance to ensure that legitimately injured workers receive all the rights and benefits provided in the workers’ compensation act; and</p>
<p class="p6">WHEREAS, Substantive efforts have already been undertaken by the general assembly, the workers’ compensation court, and the department of labor and training to eliminate the illegal, irresponsible, and unscrupulous behavior of employers who openly and deliberately operate businesses in Rhode Island without workers’ compensation insurance for their employees; and</p>
<p class="p6">WHEREAS, The actions of noncomplying employers are illegal and deprive not only injured employees of the workers’ compensation benefits to which they are entitled but also cause greater social and financial costs to all citizens of Rhode Island including employers and healthcare providers who incur uncompensated expenses in treating the victims of the uninsured employer; and</p>
<p class="p6">WHEREAS, Additional reform is required to provide payments to employees who are injured while in the service of uninsured employers and to eliminate the flagrant abuse of the system by illegally uninsured employers by requiring them to accept their legal responsibility to pay the appropriate benefits to their insured employees; now, therefore be it</p>
<p class="p6">RESOLVED, That it is declared to be the intent of the legislature that an uninsured protection fund be created to ensure that injured workers who are employed by illegally uninsured employers are not deprived of payments. The fund shall have enforcement mechanisms as are necessary to induce illegally uninsured employers to acknowledge their malfeasance, provide legally mandated payments for injured workers; and to assure that all participants in the system recognize their obligation to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the overall integrity of the compensation system. All amounts owed to the uninsured protection fund from illegally uninsured employers are intended to be excise taxes and as such, all ambiguities and uncertainties are to be resolved in favor of a determination that such assessments are excise taxes.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The workers’ compensation court shall hear all petitions for payment from the fund pursuant to § 28-30-1 et seq.; provided, however, that any petition for the commencement of compensation benefits filed against the uninsured protection fund shall be accompanied or preceded by a separate petition for the commencement of compensation benefits timely filed against the uninsured unless the petition to be filed against the uninsured employer is otherwise enjoined or prevented by law.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Where an employee is deemed to be entitled to benefits from the uninsured protection fund, the fund shall pay benefits for incapacity as provided pursuant to chapters 29 — 38 of this title except that the employee shall not be entitled to receive benefits for medical expenses pursuant to the provisions of § 28-33-5 or loss of function and disfigurement pursuant to the provisions of § 28-33-19 from the uninsured protection fund. Nothing herein shall affect an employee’s right to otherwise recover such benefits for medical expenses, loss of function, and disfigurement from an uninsured employer.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The fund shall pay costs, counsel, and witness fees, as provided in § 28-35-32, to any employee who successfully prosecutes any petitions for payment; petitions to amend a pretrial order; and all other employee petitions; and to employees who successfully defend, in whole or in part, proceedings seeking to reduce or terminate any and all payments; provided, however, that the attorney’s fees awarded to counsel who represent the employee in petitions for lump-sum commutation filed pursuant to § 28-33-25, or in the settlement of disputed cases pursuant to § 28-33-25.1, shall be limited to the maximum amount paid to counsel who serve as court-appointed attorneys in workers’ compensation proceedings as established by rule or order of the Rhode Island supreme court. Any payment ordered by the court or due under this section shall not be subject to liens set forth in § 28-33-27(b), nor shall such payments be assignable or subject to assignment in any way.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> In the event that the uninsured employer makes payment of any monies to the employee to compensate the employee in any way for the alleged work injury, the fund may be entitled to a credit for all such monies received by, or on behalf of, the employee, including, but not limited to, monies paid to the employee by any other party for the employee’s lost wages against any future benefits payable directly to the employee. The fund shall be entitled to full reimbursement from the uninsured employer for any and all payments made by the fund to the employee, as well as all costs, counsel, and witness fees paid out by the fund in connection with any claim and/or petition, plus any and all costs and attorney’s fees associated with collection and reimbursement of the fund.</p>

The matter shall be heard by the chief judge. If the court determines that the monies held by the fund are insufficient to fully make payments as they fall due, the court shall issue an order directing that a proportionate reduction be made in the payments made to those employees receiving payments from the fund.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> All employees employed by an employer of eighteen (18) or more employees in Rhode Island shall accrue a minimum of one hour of paid sick and safe leave time for every thirty five (35) hours worked up to a maximum of twenty-four (24) hours during the calendar year of 2018, thirty-two (32) hours during calendar year 2019 and up to a maximum of forty (40) hours per year thereafter, unless the employer chooses to provide a higher annual limit in both accrual and use. In determining the number of employees who are employed by an employer for compensation, all employees defined in § 28-57-3(7) shall be counted.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Employees who are exempt from the overtime requirements under 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1) of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq., will be assumed to work forty (40) hours in each work week for purposes of paid sick and safe leave time accrual unless their normal work week is less than forty (40) hours, in which case paid sick and safe leave time accrues based upon that normal work week.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Paid sick and safe leave time as provided in this chapter shall begin to accrue at the commencement of employment or pursuant to the law’s effective date [July 1, 2018], whichever is later. An employer may provide all paid sick and safe leave time that an employee is expected to accrue in a year at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> An employer may require a waiting period for newly hired employees of up to ninety (90) days. During this waiting period, an employee shall accrue earned sick time pursuant to this section or the employer’s policy, if exempt under § 28-57-4(b), but shall not be permitted to use the earned sick time until after he or she has completed the waiting period.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Paid sick and safe leave time shall be carried over to the following calendar year; however, an employee’s use of paid sick and safe leave time provided under this chapter in each calendar year shall not exceed twenty-four (24) hours during calendar year 2018, and thirty-two (32) hours during calendar year 2019, and forty (40) hours per year thereafter. Alternatively, in lieu of carryover of unused earned paid sick and safe leave time from one year to the next, an employer may pay an employee for unused earned paid sick and safe leave time at the end of a year and provide the employee with an amount of paid sick and safe leave that meets or exceeds the requirements of this chapter that is available for the employee’s immediate use at the beginning of the subsequent year.</p>

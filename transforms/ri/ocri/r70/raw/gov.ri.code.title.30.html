The state of disaster emergency shall continue until the governor finds that the threat or danger has passed or the disaster has been dealt with to the extent that emergency conditions no longer exist and terminates the state of disaster emergency by executive order or proclamation, but no state of disaster emergency may continue for longer than thirty (30) days unless renewed by the governor. The general assembly, by concurrent resolution, may terminate a state of disaster emergency at any time. Thereupon, the governor shall issue an executive order or proclamation ending the state of disaster emergency and what actions are being taken to control the emergency and what action the public should take to protect themselves. All executive orders or proclamations issued under this subsection shall indicate the nature of the disaster, the area or areas threatened, and the conditions that have brought it about or that make possible termination of the state of disaster emergency. An executive order or proclamation shall be disseminated promptly by means calculated to bring its contents to the attention of the general public and, unless the circumstances attendant upon the disaster prevent or impede, promptly filed with the agency, the secretary of state, and the city and town clerks in the area to which it applies.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> An executive order or proclamation of a state of disaster emergency, shall activate the state and local disaster emergency plans applicable to the political subdivision or area in question and shall be authority for the deployment and use of any forces to which the plan or plans apply and for the use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, and materials and facilities assembled, stockpiled, or arranged to be made available pursuant to this chapter or any other provision of law relating to disaster emergencies.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> During the continuance of any state of disaster emergency the governor is commander-in-chief of the organized and unorganized militia and of all other forces available for emergency duty.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> This state hereby enacts into law and enters into the interstate emergency management and disaster compact with all states, as defined therein, which states have enacted or shall hereafter enact the compact in the form substantially as follows:</p>
<p class="p6">Article 1. The purpose of this compact is to provide mutual aid among the states in meeting any emergency or disaster from enemy attack or other cause (natural or otherwise) including terrorism. The prompt, full and effective utilization of the resources of the respective states, including such resources as may be available from the United States government or any other source, are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people thereof in the event of any emergency, and any other resources, including personnel, equipment or supplies, shall be incorporated into a plan or plans of mutual aid to be developed among various state emergency management agencies or similar bodies of the states that are parties hereto. The directors of emergency management of all party states shall constitute a committee to formulate plans and take all necessary steps for the implementation of this compact.</p>
<p class="p6">Article 2. It shall be the duty of each party state to formulate emergency management plans and programs for application within such state. There shall be frequent consultation between the representatives of the states and with the federal emergency management agency and the free exchange of information and plans, including inventories of any materials and equipment available. In carrying out such plans and programs the party states shall so far as possible provide and follow uniform standards, practices and rules and regulations including:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Official identification to designate and distinguish the different emergency management services;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> Mobilization of emergency management forces and other tests and exercises;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> Warnings and signals tests, including mechanical devices to be used in connection therewith;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(d)</b> The effective utilization of the emergency alert system;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(e)</b> Shutting off water mains, gas mains, electric power connections and the suspension of all other utility services when deemed in the interest of overall public safety;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(f)</b> All materials or equipment used or to be used for emergency management purposes in order to assure that such materials and equipment will be easily and freely interchangeable when used in or by any other party state;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(g)</b> The conduct of population and the movement and cessation of movement of pedestrians and vehicular traffic, prior, during and subsequent to drills or actual emergencies or disasters;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(h)</b> The safety of public meetings or gatherings; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(i)</b> Mobile support units.</p>
<p class="p6">Article 3. Any party state requested to render mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state. Each party state shall extend to the emergency management forces of any other party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers (except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties, rights, privileges and immunities as if they were performing their duties in the state in which normally employed or rendering services, State of Rhode Island emergency management forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency management authorities of the state receiving assistance.</p>
<p class="p6">Article 4. Whenever any person holds a license, certificate or other permit issued by a state evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical or other skills, such person may render aid involving such skill in any party state to meet an emergency or disaster and such state shall give due recognition to such license, certificate or other permit as if issued in the state in which aid is rendered.</p>
<p class="p6">Article 5. No party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged, or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith.</p>
<p class="p6">Article 6. Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two (2) or more states may differ from that appropriate among other states party hereto, this instrument contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein contained shall preclude any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another state or states. Such supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation, and reception of injured and other persons, and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, public assistance, transportation and communications personnel, equipment and supplies.</p>
<p class="p6">Article 7. Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency management forces of that state and the representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within such state.</p>
<p class="p6">Article 8. Any party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment answering a request for aid, and for the cost incurred in connection with such request; provided, that any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense, or other cost, or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost; and provided further that any two (2) or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs as among those states. The United States government may relieve the party state receiving aid from any liability and reimburse the party state supplying emergency management forces for the compensation paid to and the transportation, subsistence and maintenance expenses of such assistance during the time of the rendition of such aid or assistance outside the state and may also pay fair and reasonable compensation for the use or utilization of the supplies, materials, equipment or facilities so utilized or consumed.</p>
<p class="p6">Article 9. Plans for the orderly evacuation and reception of the general population as the result of an emergency or disaster shall be worked out from time to time between representatives of the party states and the various local emergency management areas thereof. Such plans shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing, and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors. Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees shall be reimbursed generally for the out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care and like items. Such expenditures shall be reimbursed by the party state of which the evacuees are residents, or by the United States government under plans approved by it. After the termination of the emergency or disaster the party state of which the evacuees are resident shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support or repatriation of such evacuees.</p>
<p class="p6">Article 10. This compact shall be available to any state, territory or possession of the United States, and the District of Columbia. The term “state” may also include any neighboring foreign country or province or state thereof.</p>
<p class="p6">Article 11. The committee established pursuant to article 1 of this compact may request the civil defense agency of the United States government to act as an informational and coordinating body under this compact, and representatives of such agency of the United States government may attend meetings of such committee.</p>
<p class="p6">Article 12. This compact shall become operative immediately upon its ratification by any state as between it and any other state or states so ratifying and shall be subject to approval by congress unless prior congressional approval has been given. Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and the Rhode Island emergency management agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States government.</p>
<p class="p6">Article 13. This compact shall continue in force and remain binding on each party state until the legislature or the governor of such party state takes action to withdraw therefrom. Such action shall not be effective until thirty (30) days after notice thereof has been sent by the governor of the party state desiring to withdraw to the governors of all other party states.</p>
<p class="p6">Article 14. (a) This compact shall be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in article 1 hereof. If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional, or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected thereby.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Nothing in subsection (a) shall be construed to limit previous or future entry into the interstate emergency management and disaster compact of Rhode Island with other states.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> If any person holds a license, certificate, or other permit issued by any other state or political subdivision thereof evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or other skills, the person may render aid involving that skill in Rhode Island to meet an emergency or disaster, and this state shall give due recognition to the license, certificate, or other permit.</p>

<p class="p4"><b>30-15-44.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>International emergency management assistance compact.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The International Emergency Management Assistance Compact is hereby entered into and enacted into law with any and all of the states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article I Purpose and Authorities —</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The International Emergency Management Assistance Memorandum of Understanding, hereinafter referred to as the “compact,” is made and entered into by and among such of the jurisdictions as shall enact or adopt this compact, hereinafter referred to as “party jurisdictions.” For the purposes of this agreement, the term “jurisdictions” may include any or all of the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut and the Provinces of Québec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, and such other states and provinces as may hereafter become a party to this compact.</p>
<p class="p6">The purpose of this compact is to provide for the possibility of mutual assistance among the jurisdictions entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster when the affected jurisdiction or jurisdictions ask for assistance, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster or civil emergency aspects of resource shortages.</p>
<p class="p6">This compact also provides for the process of planning mechanisms among the agencies responsible and for mutual cooperation, including, if need be, emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party jurisdictions or subdivisions of party jurisdictions during emergencies, with such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of emergency forces by mutual agreement among party jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article II General Implementation —</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each party jurisdiction entering into this compact recognizes that many emergencies may exceed the capabilities of a party jurisdiction and that intergovernmental cooperation is essential in such circumstances. Each jurisdiction further recognizes that there will be emergencies that may require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency because few, if any, individual jurisdictions have all the resources they need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.</p>
<p class="p6">The prompt, full and effective utilization of resources of the participating jurisdictions, including any resources on hand or available from any other source that are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact are understood.</p>
<p class="p6">On behalf of the party jurisdictions participating in the compact, the legally designated official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management is responsible for formulation of the appropriate inter-jurisdictional mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact, and for recommendations to the jurisdiction concerned with respect to the amendment of any statutes, regulations or ordinances required for that purpose.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article III Party Jurisdiction Responsibilities —</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(a) Formulate plans and programs. It is the responsibility of each party jurisdiction to formulate procedural plans and programs for inter-jurisdictional cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this section. In formulating and implementing such plans and programs the party jurisdictions, to the extent practical, shall:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Review individual jurisdiction hazards analyses that are available and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party jurisdictions might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster or emergency aspects of resource shortages;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Initiate a process to review party jurisdictions’ individual emergency plans and develop a plan that will determine the mechanism for the inter-jurisdictional cooperation;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Develop inter-jurisdictional procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> Assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing jurisdictional boundaries;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> Protect and ensure delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue and critical lifeline equipment, services and resources, both human and material to the extent authorized by law; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> Inventory and agree upon procedures for the inter-jurisdictional loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> Request assistance. The authorized representative of a party jurisdiction may request assistance of another party jurisdiction by contacting the authorized representative of that jurisdiction. These provisions only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request must be confirmed in writing within fifteen (15) days of the verbal request. Requests must provide the following information:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> A description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed and of the mission or missions, including, but not limited to, fire services, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services and search and rescue;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The specific place and time for staging of the assisting party’s response and a point of contact at the location.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> Consultation among party jurisdiction officials. There shall be frequent consultation among the party jurisdiction officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities, such officials collectively known hereinafter as the International Emergency Management Group, and other appropriate representatives of the party jurisdictions with free exchange of information, plans and resource records relating to emergency capabilities to the extent authorized by law.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article IV Limitation —</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any party jurisdiction requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall undertake to respond as soon as possible, except that it is understood that the jurisdiction rendering aid may withhold or recall resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for that jurisdiction. Each party jurisdiction shall afford to the personnel of the emergency forces of any party jurisdiction, while operating within its jurisdictional limits under the terms and conditions of this compact and under the operational control of an officer of the requesting party, the same powers, duties, rights, privileges and immunities as are afforded similar or like forces of the jurisdiction in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the jurisdiction receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, by the jurisdiction that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and continue as long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving jurisdiction or jurisdictions, whichever is longer. The receiving jurisdiction is responsible for informing the assisting jurisdictions of the specific moment when services will no longer be required.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article V Licenses and Permits —</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whenever a person holds a license, certificate or other permit issued by any jurisdiction party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical or other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party jurisdiction, such person is deemed to be licensed, certified or permitted by the jurisdiction requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet an emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the requesting jurisdiction prescribes by executive order or otherwise.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article VI Liability —</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any person or entity of a party jurisdiction rendering aid in another jurisdiction pursuant to this compact are considered agents of the requesting jurisdiction for tort liability and immunity purposes. Any person or entity rendering aid in another jurisdiction pursuant to this compact are not liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article does not include willful misconduct, gross negligence or recklessness.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article VII Supplementary Agreements —</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two (2) or more jurisdictions may differ from that among the jurisdictions that are party to this compact, this compact contains elements of a broad base common to all jurisdictions, and nothing in this compact precludes any jurisdiction from entering into supplementary agreements with another jurisdiction or affects any other agreements already in force among jurisdictions. Supplementary agreements may include, but are not limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, equipment and supplies.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article VIII Workers’ Compensation and Death Benefits —</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each party jurisdiction shall provide, in accordance with its own laws, for the payment of workers’ compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that jurisdiction and to representatives of deceased members of those forces if the members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article IX Reimbursement —</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any party jurisdiction rendering aid in another jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall, if requested, be reimbursed by the party jurisdiction receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with those requests. An aiding party jurisdiction may assume in whole or in part any such loss, damage, expense or other cost or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party jurisdiction without charge or cost. Any two or more party jurisdictions may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those jurisdictions. Expenses under article VIII are not reimbursable under this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article X Evacuation —</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each party jurisdiction shall initiate a process to prepare and maintain plans to facilitate the movement of and reception of evacuees into its territory or across its territory, according to its capabilities and powers. The party jurisdiction from which the evacuees came shall assume the ultimate responsibility for the support of the evacuees, and after the termination of the emergency or disaster, for the repatriation of such evacuees.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article XI Implementation —</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(a) This compact is effective upon its execution or adoption by any two (2) jurisdictions, and is effective as to any other jurisdiction upon its execution or adoption thereby: subject to approval or authorization by the U.S. Congress, if required, and subject to enactment of provincial or state legislation that may be required for the effectiveness of the Memorandum of Understanding.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Any party jurisdiction may withdraw from this compact, but the withdrawal does not take effect until thirty (30) days after the governor or premier of the withdrawing jurisdiction has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors or premiers of all other party jurisdictions. The action does not relieve the withdrawing jurisdiction from obligations assumed under this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Duly authenticated copies of this compact in the French and English languages and of such supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article XII Severability —</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This compact is construed to effectuate the purposes stated in Article I. If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional or the applicability of the compact to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability of the compact to other persons and circumstances are not affected.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article XIII Inconsistency of Language —</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The validity of the arrangements and agreements consented to in this compact shall not be affected by any insubstantial difference in form or language as may be adopted by the various states and provinces.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Article XIV Amendment —</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This compact may be amended by agreement of the party jurisdictions.</p>

<p class="p6">This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this agreement, the term “states” is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all United States territorial possessions.</p>
<p class="p6">The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state(s), whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.</p>
<p class="p6">This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this company may include the use of the states’ National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Company or by mutual agreement between states.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.</p>
<p class="p6">The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the Federal Government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all provisions of this compact shall be understood.</p>
<p class="p6">On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.</p>

<p class="p6">Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided, that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state.</p>
<p class="p6">Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers (except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties, rights, and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving state(s) whichever is longer.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">By order of the President of the United States on February 24, 1944, there was established in the Office of War Mobilization a retraining and reemployment administration to have general supervision and direction of activities relating to the retraining and reemployment of persons discharged or released from the armed services and to develop programs for that purpose and for the adequate care of those veterans, including physical and occupational therapy for the wounded and disabled and the resumption of education interrupted by the war. By its order issued May 17, 1944, the retraining and reemployment administration outlined a plan for the establishment and maintenance of veterans’ information service centers in local communities by which it sought to provide a way to merge the interest of all organizations, federal, state, local, and civic, in the rehabilitation and assistance of veterans. To aid in the carrying out of this plan, the retraining and reemployment administration established in each state a veterans’ service committee consisting of a representative of the Selective Service System, the War Manpower Commission, and the Veterans Administration with power to enlarge its membership to include representation from local organizations or to represent the federal government on state committees of the same nature. The purpose of this chapter is to authorize the establishment of local veterans’ retraining and reemployment committees and the establishment and maintenance of veterans’ information service centers by the several cities and towns in this state to the end that all veterans may be furnished in their own communities with full information with respect to their various rights and privileges under federal and state laws and with adequate advice and assistance in securing the benefits thereof and in solving the problems of readjusting their lives from war to peacetime activities.</p>

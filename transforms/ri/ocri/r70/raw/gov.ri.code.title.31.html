<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A secured party’s failure to perfect her security interest according to the methods prescribed in this section precluded a finding that she had a perfected security interest in two automobiles, where all of the statutory sections under which she claimed to have perfected her security interest (perfection by possession, § 6A-9-305; filing in advance of perfection, § 6A-9-312(5)(a); and good faith filing in an improper place, § 6A-9-401(2)) were preempted by this section. Her security interest in the automobiles was therefore not protected under local law against a subsequent lien creditor and was not a security interest entitled to priority over a federal tax lien.

It was intended to no longer permit such retailers to act as authorized collectors of sales and use taxes on behalf of the state but that they could continue to issue temporary certificates of registration notwithstanding such enactment.

<p class="p7"><b>Due Cause for Nonrenewal.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A manufacturer who has given proper advance notice of nonrenewal of dealership agreement and can establish that its action is not arbitrary but is based on due cause should have the right not to renew. Dunne Leases Cars &amp; Trucks v. Kenworth Truck Co., 466 A.2d 1153, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1098 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure to remove motor vehicle leasing operation within the contractual time, considered with other pertinent circumstances, including the fact that the facility was inadequate and fell short of the truck company’s requirements and expectations, established due cause for nonrenewal of dealership agreement.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Termination of a dealer franchise for failure to expand facilities in accordance with a provision in a dealer agreement that was negotiated with duress or coercion was not a violation of this section.

<p class="p7"><b>Unconscionability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Truck company’s refusal to give an additional grace period, which dealer requested following receipt of letter of nonrenewal of dealership agreement, was not arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable in light of the parties’ early recognition of the need for removal of leasing operation and the dealer’s inaction in the face of repeated reassertions by the truck company of its desire for the change. Dunne Leases Cars &amp; Trucks v. Kenworth Truck Co., 466 A.2d 1153, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1098 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure of the dealer agreement to provide for compensation to the dealer for nonrenewal and also the lack of a requirement that truck company buy back the dealer’s inventory were not unconscionable and in violation of this section since there was due cause for nonrenewal.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Every manufacturer shall properly fulfill any warranty agreement and adequately and fairly compensate each of its motor vehicle dealers for labor and parts. In no event shall that compensation fail to include reasonable compensation for diagnostic work, as well as repair service and labor. All claims made by motor vehicle dealers for labor and parts shall be paid in accord with the provisions of this section. Any delay in payment after approval or disapproval that is caused by conditions beyond the reasonable control of the manufacturer shall not constitute a violation of this section. Reimbursement for warranty repairs or diagnostic work shall be at the dealer retail rate in effect at the time the warranty repair or diagnostic work is performed. Compensation for parts used in warranty service shall be fair and reasonable, as determined by methods described in subsection (b). Compensation for labor used in warranty service shall be fair and reasonable, as determined by methods described in subsection (c).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for parts shall be established by the dealer submitting to the manufacturer or distributor one hundred (100) sequential non-warranty customer-paid service repair orders that contain warranty-like parts, or sixty (60) consecutive days of non-warranty customer-paid service repair orders that contain warranty-like parts, whichever is less, covering repairs made no more than one hundred eighty (180) days before the submission and declaring the average percentage markup. The average of the markup rates shall be presumed to be fair and reasonable, however, a manufacturer or distributor may, not later than thirty (30) days after submission, rebut that presumption by reasonably substantiating that the rate is unfair and unreasonable in light of the practices of all other franchised motor vehicle dealers in the vicinity offering the same line-make vehicles. The retail rate shall go into effect thirty (30) days following the declaration, subject to audit of the submitted repair orders by the franchisor and a rebuttal of the declared rate as described above. If the declared rate is rebutted, the manufacturer or distributor shall propose an adjustment of the average percentage markup based on that rebuttal not later than thirty (30) days after submission. If the dealer does not agree with the proposed average percentage markup, the dealer may file a protest with the department not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of that proposal by the manufacturer or distributor. If the protest is filed, the department shall inform the manufacturer or distributor that a timely protest has been filed and that a hearing will be held on the protest. In any hearing held pursuant to this subsection, the manufacturer or distributor shall have the burden of proving that the rate declared by the dealer was unfair and unreasonable as described in this subsection and that the proposed adjustment of the average percentage markup is fair and reasonable pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for labor may be established by submitting to the manufacturer or distributor all non-warranty customer-paid service repair orders covering repairs made during the month prior to the submission and dividing the amount of the dealer’s total labor sales by the number of total labor hours that generated those sales. The average labor rate shall be presumed to be fair and reasonable, provided a manufacturer or distributor may, not later than thirty (30) days after submission, rebut the presumption by reasonably substantiating that the rate is unfair and unreasonable in light of the practices of all other franchised motor vehicle dealers in the vicinity offering the same line-make vehicles. The average labor rate shall go into effect thirty (30) days following the declaration, subject to audit of the submitted repair orders by the franchisor and a rebuttal of the declared rate. If the declared rate is rebutted, the manufacturer or distributor shall propose an adjustment of the average labor rate based on the rebuttal not later than thirty (30) days after submission. If the dealer does not agree with the proposed average labor rate, the dealer may file a protest with the department not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of that proposal by the manufacturer or distributor. If a protest is filed, the department shall inform the manufacturer or distributor that a timely protest has been filed and that a hearing will be held on the protest. In any hearing held pursuant to this subsection, the manufacturer or distributor shall have the burden of proving that the rate declared by the dealer was unfair and unreasonable as described in this subsection and that the proposed adjustment of the average labor rate is fair and reasonable pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> A manufacturer or distributor may not require a dealer to establish the retail rate customarily charged by the dealer for parts and labor by an unduly burdensome or time-consuming method or by requiring information that is unduly burdensome or time consuming to provide, including, but not limited to, part-by-part or transaction-by-transaction calculations. A dealer may not declare an average percentage markup or average labor rate more than twice in one calendar year.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> A manufacturer or distributor may not otherwise recover its costs from dealers within this state, including an increase in the wholesale price of a vehicle or surcharge imposed on a dealer solely intended to recover the cost of reimbursing a dealer for parts and labor pursuant to this section, provided a manufacturer or distributor shall not be prohibited from increasing prices for vehicles or parts in the normal course of business.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> Each manufacturer or distributor shall perform all warranty obligations, include in written notices of factory recalls to owners and dealers the expected date by which necessary parts and equipment will be available to dealers for the correction of the defects, and compensate dealers for repairs necessitated by such recall.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> A manufacturer shall compensate its new motor vehicle dealers for all labor and parts required by the manufacturer to perform recall repairs. Compensation for recall repairs shall be at the dealer retail rate in effect at the time the recall repair work is performed. The dealer retail rate for parts and labor shall be at the same rates as those provided for under § 31-5.1-6. If parts or a remedy are not reasonably available to perform a recall service or repair on a used vehicle held for sale by the dealer authorized to sell new vehicles of the same line-make within thirty (30) days of the manufacturer issuing the initial notice of recall and the manufacturer has issued a “Stop-Sale,” or “Do-Not-Drive,” order on the vehicle, the manufacturer shall compensate the dealer at a rate of at least one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the value of the vehicle per month, or portion of a month, while the recall or remedy parts are unavailable and the “Stop-Sale,” or “Do-Not-Drive,” order remains in effect. A “Stop-Sale” shall be defined as a notification issued by a vehicle manufacturer to its franchised dealerships stating that certain used vehicles in inventory shall not be sold or leased, at retail and/or wholesale, due to a federal safety recall for a defect or a noncompliance, or a federal or California emissions recall.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The value of a used vehicle shall be the average trade-in value for used vehicles as indicated in an independent, third-party guide for the year, make, model, and mileage of the recalled vehicle on the later of:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The date the “Stop-Sale” or “Do-Not-Drive” order was issued; or</p>

This section further shall apply only to new motor vehicle dealers holding an affected used motor vehicle for sale that was:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> In inventory at the time the “Stop-Sale” or “Do-Not-Drive” order was issued;</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> It shall be a violation of this section for a manufacturer to reduce the amount of compensation otherwise owed to a new motor vehicle dealer, whether through a chargeback; removal from an incentive program; reduction in amount owed under an incentive program; or any other means, because the new motor vehicle dealer has submitted a claim for reimbursement under this section, or was otherwise compensated for a vehicle subject to a recall where a “Stop-Sale,” or “Do-Not-Drive,” order has been issued.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> All reimbursement claims made by new motor vehicle dealers pursuant to this section for recall remedies or repairs, or for compensation where no part or repair is reasonably available and the vehicle is subject to a “Stop-Sale” or “Do-Not-Drive” order, shall be subject to the same limitations and requirements as a warranty reimbursement claim made under § 31-5.1-6. Claims shall be either approved or disapproved within thirty (30) days after they are submitted to the manufacturer in the manner and on the forms the manufacturer reasonably prescribes. All claims shall be paid within thirty (30) days of approval of the claim by the manufacturer. Any claim not specifically disapproved in writing within thirty (30) days after the manufacturer receives a properly submitted claim shall be deemed to be approved.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To construe the language of this section as requiring the consumer to return a nonconforming vehicle solely to the manufacturer at its place of business, and not to an authorized dealer located within the state, would violate the legislature’s intent and effectuate an absurd result.

<p class="p7"><b>Dealer’s Liability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While a dealer may have no liability to refund the purchase price or to replace a nonconforming vehicle, it still can serve as a conduit or agent for the buyer/lessee’s return of the vehicle to the manufacturer and for the manufacturer’s replacement or refund, particularly as the dealer may remain liable in the event that it has failed to fulfill its legal obligations under the lemon law to cure the nonconforming vehicle by properly performing repairs.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> In addition to any settlement procedure provided for in § 31-5.2-7, the department of the attorney general shall provide an independent arbitration procedure for the settlement of disputes between consumers or lessees and manufacturers concerning motor vehicles which do not conform to all applicable express or implied warranties. There shall be established the motor vehicle arbitration board which shall consist of five (5) members. The board shall consist of the attorney general or his or her designee, who shall serve as director, a member of the general public appointed by the attorney general, the director of the department of revenue or his or her designee, the president of the Rhode Island Automobile Dealers’ Association or his or her designee, and the administrator of the division of motor vehicles or his or her designee, only one of whom shall be directly involved in the manufacture, distribution, sale, lease, or service of any automobile product. Members shall be persons interested in consumer disputes, and shall serve without compensation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> An owner or lessee of any motor vehicle purchased or leased which fails to conform to the applicable express or implied warranties may either initiate a request with the department of attorney general for arbitration by the motor vehicle arbitration board or take part in the settlement procedure set forth in § 31-5.2-7 if in existence. The consumer or lessee shall set forth, on a complaint form prescribed by the department of attorney general, any information he or she deems relevant to the resolution of the dispute and shall file the complaint with a nonrefundable filing fee of twenty dollars ($20.00). The attorney general shall decide if the complaint is eligible under chapter 5.2 of this title. Upon acceptance of the complaint, the attorney general shall notify the manufacturer of the filing of a request for arbitration and shall obtain from the manufacturer, in writing on a form prescribed by the attorney general, any information the manufacturer deems relevant to the resolution of the dispute. The manufacturer shall return the form, along with a non-refundable fifty dollar ($50.00) filing fee, within twenty (20) days of receipt. The department of attorney general shall then refer the matter to the motor vehicle arbitration board created pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The motor vehicle arbitration board shall investigate, gather, and organize all information necessary for a fair and timely decision in each dispute. The board may issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, papers, and records relevant to the dispute.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> At all arbitration proceedings before the board the parties may present oral or written testimony, present witnesses and evidence relevant to the dispute, cross examine witnesses, and be represented by counsel.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The motor vehicle arbitration board may forward a copy of all written testimony, including all documentary evidence, to an independent technical expert, who shall review the material and be able to advise and consult with the board. An expert shall sit as a non-voting member of the board whenever oral testimony is presented. The expert shall provide advice and counsel to the board as a part of its deliberation process and shall aid the board in preparing its findings and facts.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The motor vehicle arbitration board shall grant the relief specified in § 31-5.2-3 of this chapter and any other relief available under the applicable warranties or the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, 88 Stat. 2183 (1975), 15 U.S.C. section 2301 et seq., as in effect on October 1, 1982, to the consumer or lessee if a reasonable number of attempts, as provided in § 31-5.2-5(1) and (2) have been undertaken to correct one or more nonconformities that substantially impair the motor vehicle. The motor vehicle arbitration board shall dismiss the dispute if it finds, after considering all the evidence presented, that the consumer or lessee is not entitled to relief under this chapter.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g) (1)</b> The board shall, as expeditiously as possible, but not later than ninety (90) days from the date the director deems the dispute eligible for arbitration, render a fair decision based on the information gathered and disclose its findings and the reasons for it to the parties involved. The consumer or lessee shall accept or reject the decision within five (5) days of its filing.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> If the decision is favorable to the consumer or lessee, the manufacturer shall within thirty (30) days after the rendering of the decision, either comply with the terms of the decision if the consumer or lessee elects to accept the decision or appeal the finding to superior court. No appeal by a manufacturer shall be heard unless the petition for such appeal is filed with the clerk of the superior court within thirty (30) days of issuance of the finding of the motor vehicle arbitration board and is accompanied by a bond in a principal sum equal to the money award made by the state-certified arbitrator plus two thousand five-hundred dollars ($2,500) for anticipated attorneys’ fees, secured by cash or its equivalent, payable to the consumer. The liability of the surety of any bond filed pursuant to this section shall be limited to the indemnification of the consumer in the action. Such bond shall not limit or impair any right of recovery otherwise available pursuant to law, nor shall the amount of the bond be relevant in determining the amount of recovery to which the consumer shall be entitled. In the event that any motor vehicle arbitration board decision, resulting in an award of a refund or replacement, is upheld by the court, recovery by the consumer shall include continuing damages in the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per day for each day, subsequent to the day the motor vehicle was returned to the manufacturer pursuant to § 31-5.2-3, that said vehicle was out of use as a direct result of any nonconformity not issuing from owner negligence, accident, vandalism or any attempt to repair or substantially modify the vehicle by a person other than the manufacturer, its agent or authorized dealer; provided, however, that the manufacturer did not make a comparable vehicle available to the consumer free of charge. In addition to any other recovery, any prevailing consumer shall be awarded reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. If the court finds that the manufacturer did not have any reasonable basis for its appeal or that the appeal was frivolous, the court shall double the amount of the total award made to the consumer. The motor vehicle arbitration board shall contact the consumer or lessee, within ten (10) working days after the date for performance, to determine whether performance has occurred.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> The motor vehicle arbitration board shall maintain the records of each dispute as deemed necessary, including an index of disputes by brand name and model. The motor vehicle arbitration board shall, at intervals of no more than six (6) months, compile and maintain statistics indicating the record of manufacturer compliance with arbitration decisions and the number of refunds or replacement awarded. The summary shall be a public record.</p>

The display of this public notice shall be a condition of licensure under the general laws. The board shall determine the size, type face, form and wording of the sign required by this section, which shall include the telephone number and the address to which requests for the motor vehicle arbitration board arbitration services may be sent.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(j)</b> The motor vehicle arbitration board shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of the general laws to carry out the purposes of this section.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> If the dealer or his or her agent fails to correct a malfunction or defect as required by the warranty specified in this section which substantially impairs the value of the used motor vehicle to the consumer after a reasonable period of time, the dealer shall accept the return of the used motor vehicle from the consumer and refund to the consumer the full purchase price including sales or compensating use tax, less a reasonable allowance for any damage not attributable to normal wear or usage, and an adjustment for any modifications which either increase or decrease the market value of the vehicle. In determining the purchase price to be refunded, the purchase price shall be deemed equal to the sum of the actual cash difference paid for the used motor vehicle plus, if the dealer elects to not return any vehicles traded-in by the consumer, the wholesale value of those traded-in vehicles as listed in the National Auto Dealers’ Association Used Car Guide, or any other guide that may be specified in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the division of motor vehicles, as adjusted for mileage, improvements, and any major physical or mechanical defects in the traded-in vehicle at the time of trade-in. The contract of sale for the used motor vehicle shall include conspicuous language indicating that if the consumer should be entitled to a refund pursuant to this section, the value of any vehicle traded-in by the consumer, if the dealer elects to not return it to the consumer, for purposes of determining the amount of the refund will be determined by reference to the National Auto Dealers’ Association Used Car Guide wholesale value, or any other guide that may be approved by the administrator of the division of motor vehicles, as adjusted for mileage, improvements, and any major physical or mechanical defects, rather than the value listed in the sales contract. Refunds shall be made to the consumer and lienholder, if any, as their interests may appear on the records of ownership kept by the division of motor vehicles. If the amount to be refunded to the lienholder will be insufficient to discharge the lien, the dealer shall notify the consumer in writing by registered or certified mail that the consumer has thirty (30) days to pay the lienholder the amount which, together with the amount to be refunded by the dealer, will be sufficient to discharge the lien. The notice to the consumer shall contain conspicuous language warning the consumer that failure to pay those funds to the lienholder within thirty (30) days will terminate the dealer’s obligation to provide a refund. If the consumer fails to make the payment within thirty (30) days, the dealer shall have no further responsibility to provide a refund under this section. Alternatively, the dealer may elect to offer to replace the used motor vehicle with a comparably priced vehicle, with any adjustment in price that the parties may agree to. The consumer shall not be obligated to accept a replacement vehicle, but may instead elect to receive the refund provided under this section. It shall be an affirmative defense to any claim under this section that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The malfunction or defect does not substantially impair the used motor vehicle’s value; or</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> It shall be presumed that a dealer has had a reasonable opportunity to correct a malfunction or defect in a used motor vehicle, if:</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The vehicle is out of service by reason of repair or malfunction or defect for a cumulative total of fifteen (15) or more days during the warranty period. That period shall not include days when the dealer is unable to complete the repair because of the unavailability of necessary repair parts. The dealer shall be required to exercise due diligence in attempting to obtain necessary repair parts. If, however, a vehicle has been out of service for a cumulative total of forty-five (45) days, even if a portion of that time is attributable to the unavailability of replacement parts, the consumer shall be entitled to the replacement or refund remedies provided in this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The term of any warranty, service contract, or repair insurance shall be extended by any time period during which the used motor vehicle is in the possession of the dealer or his or her duly authorized agent for the purpose of repairing the used motor vehicle under the terms and obligations of the warranty, service contract, or repair insurance.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The term of any warranty, service contract, or repair insurance, and the fifteen (15) days out-of-service period, shall be extended by any time during which repair services are not available to the consumer because of a war, invasion or strike, fire, flood, or other natural disaster.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>Article I. Purposes and Principles</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> <b>Purposes of agreement.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is the purpose of this agreement to set up a system by which any contracting state may permit owners of fleets of buses operating in two or more states to prorate the registration of the buses in such fleets in each state in which the fleets operate on the basis of the proportion of miles operated within such state to total fleet miles, as defined in this agreement.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> <b>Principle of proration of registration.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is declared that in making this agreement the contracting states adhere to the principle that each state should have the freedom to develop the kind of highway user tax structure that it determines to be most appropriate to itself; that the method of taxation of interstate buses should not be a determining factor in developing its user tax structure; and that annual taxes or other taxes of the fixed fee type upon buses, which are not imposed on a basis that reflects the amount of highway use, should be apportioned among the states, within the limits of practicality, on the basis of vehicle miles traveled within each of the states.</p>

Further, the trial court did not err by ordering the sentences for the breaking and entering, consipracy to commit breaking and entering, simple assault, and driving a motor vehicle without the permission of the owner to run consecutively rather than concurrently since the trial court justified its order by finding that it was not just a run-of-the-mill breaking and entering, the lives of the victims were changed forever, the defendant had no remorse for the crimes, and took no personal responsibility for his actions.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The purpose of this chapter is to implement the federal Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 (CMVSA) (see now 49 U.S.C. § 31101 et seq.), as may be amended from time to time and reduce or prevent commercial motor vehicle accidents, fatalities, and injuries by:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Permitting drivers to hold only one license;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Disqualifying commercial drivers who have committed certain serious traffic violations, or other specified offenses;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Strengthening commercial driver licensing and testing standards.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> It is the intent of this chapter to have an operator’s license serve as the base license to which classifications, endorsements, and restrictions can be added which may change the classification to a commercial or chauffeur’s license. If the person commits any offense which results in a withdrawal of the commercial license or privilege under this chapter and the offense would be cause for withdrawal of the base license or privilege, the department shall withdraw the commercial endorsements, restrictions, or classifications and for the required fee(s) issue an operator’s license or privilege.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> If any offense would cause withdrawal of the base license and commercial or chauffeur’s license but for different terms that person may be restored to the base license after the time specified in the applicable section(s) within this title upon payment of the required fee(s). If an offense is committed which, except for this chapter, causes a license or privilege withdrawal of a base license, it shall be cause for removing the commercial or chauffeur classification(s), restriction(s), and endorsement(s) or privileges to operate a commercial vehicle for the time specified in this title.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> This chapter is a remedial law which shall be liberally construed to promote the public health, safety, and welfare. To the extent that this chapter conflicts with general driver licensing provisions, this chapter shall prevail. Where this chapter is silent, the general driver licensing provisions shall apply. This chapter applies to every person who operates a commercial motor vehicle in interstate, foreign, or intrastate commerce and to all employers of these persons.</p>

When a licensee requests a hearing, no action to suspend his or her license shall be taken until a hearing decision has been rendered in accordance with subsections (d) — (f) of this section. The division of motor vehicles shall notify the licensee in writing of the factual and legal basis for the proposed suspension, the procedure for requesting a hearing, and the rights afforded the individual pursuant to subsections (d) — (f) of this section. When physical or mental fitness is the basis for the suspension recommendation, the notice shall reference the specific functional standard promulgated pursuant to § 31-10-44(b), which was relied upon by the division of motor vehicles.</p>

During any hearing, the division of motor vehicles shall bear the burden of proof as to the existence of the grounds for the suspension. The division of motor vehicles shall further ensure that during a hearing to determine the physical or mental fitness of a licensee, proof of the lack of physical or mental fitness shall be by clear and convincing evidence. The presumption of inability to operate a motor vehicle with safety established by the functional standards promulgated pursuant to § 31-10-44(b), shall be rebuttable by evidence that notwithstanding an individual’s functional limitation, he or she is able to safely operate a motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> For the purpose of the hearing procedures described in subsection (d) of this section, the administrator of the division of motor vehicles or his or her duly authorized agent may administer oaths and may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant books and papers, and may require a reexamination of the licensee.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state may prohibit unlicensed drivers from operating a motor vehicle on the state’s public highways as a valid exercise of the state’s police power. Furthermore, it is evident that R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-11-18 is rationally related to the state’s legitimate interest in maintaining the safety of its public thoroughfares. Section 31-11-18 is constitutional as applied to motor-vehicle operators on this state’s public highways, including the defendant, regardless of his unwillingness to recognize the federal government. State v. Garvin, 945 A.2d 821, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 52 (R.I.), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1012, 129 S. Ct. 571, 172 L. Ed. 2d 430, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 8233 (2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court erred in dismissing the charges against defendant for driving under the influence of liquor resulting in serious bodily injury, driving so as to endanger resulting in serious bodily injury, and driving with a revoked license because an operator may be distinct and separate from a driver in certain circumstances, and by forcibly seizing control of a moving vehicle when he jumped up from the backseat and grabbed the steering wheel—thus divesting the driver of control—and steering the vehicle off the highway, causing a roll-over crash, defendant placed himself squarely in the realm of an operator of a vehicle. State v. Peters, 172 A.3d 156, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 107 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Civil Penalty.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>District court erred in denying defendant’s motion to seal his record under R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-1-12 because he was a person detained by police but not arrested or charged with an offense; defendant was not “charged with an offense” because the “criminal complaint” charged him with a violation of this section and indicated it was his first violation, and thus, defendant was liable only for a civil penalty. State ex rel. Coventry Police Dep't v. Charlwood, 224 A.3d 467, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 12 (R.I. 2020).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Driver’s Abstract.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for driving with a suspended license, a driver’s abstract from the Registry of Motor Vehicles was clearly admissible under Rules 901(b)(7) and 902(4) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, and was not excluded under Rule 803(8)(B) because it did not contain information observed by police officers or law-enforcement personnel. Also, the admission of this abstract did not violate the defendant’s right to confrontation under the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions by allowing, in effect, New York officials to testify about violations in that state. The report did not contain any statements by New York officials, only a notation of the New York violation. State v. D'Alo, 649 A.2d 498, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 256 (R.I. 1994).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Judicial Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no reason why any court of competent jurisdiction in the state cannot take judicial notice that a particular street is a highway which is open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular traffic. State v. Jamgochian, 109 R.I. 46, 280 A.2d 320, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1022 (1971), overruled in part, State v. Acquisto, 463 A.2d 122, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1012 (R.I. 1983).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the statute does not prescribe that the officer must be engaged exclusively in the control or direction of the traffic or that he must be specifically assigned to such duty and where the evidence showed that the officer was in uniform and was on patrol, he had authority to control and regulate the traffic.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section and §§ 31-14-2 and 31-14-3 must be read together in order to apprise a driver of the legislative standard for determining what is a reasonable and proper speed in the circumstances in which he finds himself. State v. Campbell, 97 R.I. 111, 196 A.2d 131, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 130 (1963).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Emergency Doctrine.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant came over the crest of a hill on a rainy night and was unable to stop when he saw stopped vehicles blocking a portion of the road, the trial judge properly refused to charge the sudden emergency doctrine which holds a party to an accident blameless when he is confronted with a sudden emergency not created by him which he could not have reasonably foreseen. Markham v. Cross Transp., 119 R.I. 213, 376 A.2d 1359, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1899 (1977).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where evidence of speed violation was overwhelming, admission of prior speeding convictions into evidence was harmless error. State v. Sprague, 113 R.I. 351, 322 A.2d 36, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1186 (1974).</p>

Gen. Laws § 31-14-1. Nationwide Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. D.F. Pepper Constr., 59 A.3d 106, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 23 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Prima Facie Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was within the authority of the legislature under the police power to fix a standard of care. The prima facie limit may be taken into account by the jury as evidence of excessive speed over and above the reasonable and prudent speed. This title is not unconstitutional for the reason that it was an attempt by the legislature to exercise judicial power and deprive the defendant of his property without due process of law. State v. Costakos, 92 R.I. 415, 169 A.2d 383, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 50 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Complaint.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where accusation set out in the complaint was confined to the language of this section, namely, that he did drive a vehicle on the highway of this state “at a speed greater than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions and having regard to the actual and potential hazards then existing”, it did not meet the constitutional requirement of reasonable certainty since it could not be determined whether acts described in § 31-14-2 or § 31-14-3 constituted the violation. State v. Campbell, 97 R.I. 111, 196 A.2d 131, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 130 (1963); State v. Brown, 97 R.I. 115, 196 A.2d 133, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 131 (1963); State v.

<p class="p7"><b>Suspension of License.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a person was charged with driving at speed of 20 miles or more per hour greater than reasonable and prudent it was mandatory that his license be suspended under the provisions of § 31-11-18 where he pleaded guilty or nolo contendere or was adjudged guilty notwithstanding he claimed an appeal to the district court.

<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a special hazard exists, the legislature has placed on a defendant the burden of establishing that driving at a rate otherwise lawful was not unreasonable in the circumstances of a particular case. State v. Noble, 95 R.I. 263, 186 A.2d 336, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 153 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction of Section.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Vehicle already proceeding at rate that was reasonable for an intersection was not required to reduce speed on approaching intersection. McWright v. Providence Tel. Co., 47 R.I. 196, 131 A. 841, 1926 R.I. LEXIS 29 (1926).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section was intended to prohibit the crossing of an intersection or railway grade crossing without a reduction in speed. State v. McGuire, 90 R.I. 191, 156 A.2d 496, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 135 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Acting within its exclusive prerogative to declare public policy, the legislature has provided that failure to drive at an appropriate speed at a time or place, when one of the enumerated hazards of this section exists, would constitute a misdemeanor. State v. Noble, 95 R.I. 263, 186 A.2d 336, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 153 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Contention of defendant that since road did not cross avenue, it becoming dead-end at avenue, and only intersected what is stated to be the easterly side thereof, that it is not an intersection, was overruled, there being no merit in this contention for the legislature was mindful that traffic on the road would inevitably feed into the traffic on the avenue. State v. Noble, 95 R.I. 263, 186 A.2d 336, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 153 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice’s holding that the use of conjunction “and” preceding the fifth and final clause showed that the legislature intended such clause to be in the disjunctive, constituting a separate violation of the provisions of § 31-14-1, was supported on thorough reading and careful analysis of this chapter. State v. Noble, 95 R.I. 263, 186 A.2d 336, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 153 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Criminal Complaint.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Absence of allegation in criminal complaint that defendant failed to reduce his speed when approaching “and crossing” an intersection rendered the complaint for not reducing speed when approaching intersection invalid. State v. McGuire, 90 R.I. 191, 156 A.2d 496, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 135 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the complaint in no manner discloses whether the unreasonable operation with which the defendant is therein charged was in excess of the speed limits provided in § 31-14-2 or resulted from a failure to reduce speed in the face of one of the hazards provided for in this section, it was obviously so vague and indefinite as to be violative of Const., art. I, § 10. State v. Brown, 97 R.I. 115, 196 A.2d 133, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 131 (1963). See also State v. Campbell, 97 R.I. 111, 196 A.2d 131, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 130 (1963); State v. Marsocci, 98 R.I. 478, 204 A.2d 639, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 198 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Emergency Doctrine.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant came over the crest of a hill on a rainy night and was unable to stop when he saw stopped vehicles blocking a portion of the road, the trial judge properly refused to charge the sudden emergency doctrine which holds a party to an accident blameless when he is confronted with a sudden emergency not created by him which he could not have reasonably foreseen. Markham v. Cross Transp., 119 R.I. 213, 376 A.2d 1359, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1899 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant was charged with failing to drive at an appropriate reduced speed when approaching and going around a curve, and a sketch giving exact distances relative to the car, the poles and skid marks, and pictures were introduced showing the position and condition of the car, poles and skid marks, it was not error for the court to admit the testimony of the investigating officer who said defendant admitted being the driver of the car. State v. Wheeler, 92 R.I. 389, 169 A.2d 7, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 43 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Officer’s estimate of speed at which defendant was approaching and crossing the intersection was admissible even though no foundation was laid to qualify him as an expert, such not being necessary, since the only question was whether defendant reduced his speed as he approached and crossed the intersection. State v. Noble, 95 R.I. 263, 186 A.2d 336, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 153 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have inferred that the defendant was negligent by failing to reduce speed when approaching an intersection in poor weather, and where there was a jury question as to whether a second injury aggravated an injury sustained in the first incident, the trial court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law for the defendant.

Hence, the jury may be instructed that a violation of this section may be considered as evidence that a duty owed to schoolchildren was breached, but not that a duty to another motorist located down the road was breached.

<p class="p6">The general assembly declares that the use of racial profiling for stopping or searching motorists on our public highways is against public policy and violates the civil rights of the motorist. For purposes of this chapter, “racial profiling” means the detention, interdiction or other disparate treatment of an individual on the basis, in whole or in part, of the racial or ethnic status of such individual, except when such status is used in combination with other identifying factors in seeking to apprehend a specific suspect whose racial or ethnic status is part of the description of the suspect. The purpose of this chapter is to conduct a study of the traffic stops by the police to determine whether racial profiling is occurring and to require that police prohibit the practice of racial profiling.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The use by police officers of race, ethnicity, or national origin solely in deciding which persons should be subject to traffic stops, searches and seizures is improper.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Unless there exists reasonable suspicion or probable cause of criminal activity, no motor vehicle stopped for a traffic violation shall be detained beyond the time needed to address the violation. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the detention of a motor vehicle for a reasonable period of time for the arrival of a canine unit or subsequent criminal investigation if there is reasonable suspicion or probable cause of criminal activity.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> No operator or owner-passenger of a motor vehicle shall be requested to consent to a search by a law enforcement officer of his or her motor vehicle, that is stopped solely for a traffic violation, unless there exists reasonable suspicion or probable cause of criminal activity. No pedestrian shall be requested to consent to a search by a law enforcement officer of his or her person, unless there exists reasonable suspicion or probable cause of criminal activity. No juvenile shall be requested to consent to a search by a law enforcement officer unless there exists reasonable suspicion or probable cause of criminal activity. In those instances in which a warrant would be required, a law enforcement officer must advise the juvenile that he or she may refuse to consent to, or limit the scope of, any requested search. The determination of age of the individual shall be based on the perception of the officer making a good faith effort in advance of requesting consent. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a law enforcement officer from conducting a pat down search for weapons based upon a reasonable belief that the officer’s personal safety may be jeopardized.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Each search conducted by a law enforcement officer that does not result in criminal charges shall be documented in a computer-aided dispatch (CAD) entry or other police-generated report. Each search conducted by a law enforcement officer that results in criminal charges shall be documented in a police-generated report. The CAD entry or formal police report shall include the date, time, and location of the stop/search, along with the “reasonable suspicion” or “probable cause” leading to the search. The CAD entry or formal police report shall also include the race, age, and gender of the individual(s) searched and the results of the search. The document, exclusive of information identifying the law enforcement officer, shall be a public record, subject to the access to public records act, § 38-2-2(4)(D), law enforcement exemptions. For purposes of this section, “computer-aided dispatch” (CAD) means an electronic system used by public safety agencies to facilitate incident response and communications in the field that electronically records information on call taking, dispatching, location verification, mapping, and other functions for public safety.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> With the exception of operators who are subject to federal motor carrier regulations, no operator of a motor vehicle shall be requested to provide any documentation or identification other than a driver’s license, motor vehicle registration, and/or proof of insurance when the motor vehicle has been stopped solely for a traffic violation, unless there exists reasonable suspicion or probable cause of criminal activity or the operator has failed to produce a valid driver’s license.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> If a violation of the traffic laws in this title is used to stop a motor vehicle for non-related investigatory reasons, the law enforcement officer shall document in writing or electronically the investigatory basis for the stop. The documentation of such stops shall commence no later than twelve (12) months after passage of this act and shall be assessed every six (6) months by the respective police department as to whether the suspicion was justified and the data be made publicly available, subject to the access to public records act, § 38-2-2(4)(D), law enforcement exemptions.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Any evidence obtained as a result of a search prohibited by subsection (a) or (b) shall be inadmissible in any judicial proceeding. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any search otherwise based upon any legally sufficient cause.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Every motor vehicle, other than a motorcycle or motor-driven cycle, when operated upon a highway, shall be equipped with brakes adequate to control the movement of and to stop and hold the vehicle, including two (2) separate means of applying the brakes, each of which means shall be effective to apply the brakes to at least two (2) wheels. If these two separate means of applying the brakes are connected in any way, they shall be so constructed that failure of any one part of the operating mechanism shall not leave the motor vehicle without brakes on at least two (2) wheels.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Every motorcycle, and motor-driven cycle, when operated upon a highway shall be equipped with at least one brake, which may be operated by hand or foot, and which is adequate to control and stop the vehicle.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Every trailer or semi-trailer of a gross weight of four thousand pounds (4,000 lbs.) or more, when operated upon a highway, shall be equipped with brakes adequate to control the movement of and to stop and to hold the vehicle, and so designed as to be applied by the driver of the towing motor vehicle from the driver’s normal operating position, and the brakes shall be so designed and connected that in case of an accidental breakaway of the towed vehicle, the brakes shall be automatically applied.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Every new motor vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer sold in this state and operated upon the highways shall be equipped with service brakes upon all wheels of the vehicle, except any motorcycle or motor-driven cycle, and except that any semi-trailer of less than four thousand pounds (4,000 lbs.) gross weight need not be equipped with brakes.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> In any combination of motor-drawn vehicles, means shall be provided for applying:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The rearmost trailer brakes, of any trailer equipped with brakes, in approximate synchronism with the brakes on the towing vehicle and developing the required braking effort on the rearmost wheels at the fastest rate; or</p>

The parking brakes shall be capable of being applied in conformance with the requirements in this subsection by the driver’s muscular effort, by spring action, or by equivalent means. The operation may be assisted by the service brakes or other source of power, provided that failure of the service brake actuation system or other power assisting mechanism will not prevent the parking brakes from being applied in conformance with the requirements in this subsection. The parking brakes shall be so designed that when once applied they shall remain applied with the required effectiveness, despite exhaustion of any source of energy or leakage of any kind. The same brake drums, brake shoes and lining assemblies, brake shoe anchors, and mechanical brake shoe actuation mechanism normally associated with the wheel brake assemblies may be used for both the service brakes and the parking brakes. If the means of applying the parking brakes and the service brakes are connected in any way, they shall be so constructed that failure of any one part shall not leave the vehicle without operative brakes.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> The brake shoes operating within or upon the drums on the vehicle wheels of any motor vehicle may be used for both service and hand operation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> It shall be unlawful to sell, offer for sale, or distribute brake linings for use on motor vehicles, unless they are of a type and meet specifications promulgated by the administrator of the division of motor vehicles. The administrator of the division of motor vehicles is authorized and empowered to adopt and amend regulations governing types and promulgate specifications of brake linings which comply with approved standards, as promulgated by the vehicle equipment safety commission, and shall establish and maintain an approved list of brake linings meeting the specifications as established in this chapter.

<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> The appropriate motor vehicle agency of a party state may decline to adopt a rule, regulation or code issued by the commission pursuant to this article if that agency specifically finds, after public hearing on due notice, that a variation from the commission’s rule, regulation or code is necessary to the public safety, and incorporates in that finding the reasons upon which it is based. Any such finding shall be subject to review by whatever procedure for review of administrative determinations as may be applicable pursuant to the laws of the party state. Upon request, the commission shall be furnished with a copy of the transcript of any hearings held pursuant to this subdivision.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice’s instruction to the jury that defendant by asserting his intoxication and therefore lack of knowledge that he had been involved in the accident raised an affirmative defense which it was his duty to prove was eminently correct as to the placement of the burden of proof. State v. Deans, 93 R.I. 266, 174 A.2d 266 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Complaint.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Complaint charging that defendant did not stop “or return” to the scene of the accident was not duplicitous. State v. Smith, 29 R.I. 513, 72 A. 710, 1909 R.I. LEXIS 50 (1909).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Complaint charging failure to stop or return to the scene of the accident was not defective for failure to charge failure to give information. State v. Smith, 29 R.I. 513, 72 A. 710, 1909 R.I. LEXIS 50 (1909).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Constructive Knowledge.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Knowledge of a collision or of injury or death may be from constructive knowledge under subsection (a). State v. Baker, 627 A.2d 835, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 185 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Decedent’s Conduct.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for violation of this section and § 31-27-1, where the defendant’s conduct was clearly a proximate cause of the victim’s death, and where the victim’s conduct could not be held to be the sole proximate cause of the fatality, the trial justice did not err in instructing the jury not to consider the victim’s conduct in determining whether or not the defendant’s conduct was a proximate cause of death. State v. Watkins, 448 A.2d 1260, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 993 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Knowledge.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the mere presence at or near the scene of the accident in and of itself is not sufficient to prove an element of the crime under this section beyond a reasonable doubt, it is a factor that the jury can take into account in reaching its verdict. State v. Szarek, 433 A.2d 193, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1234 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The seriousness of the resulting injuries are a factor for the jury to consider in determining whether a defendant had knowledge that he was involved in an accident resulting in physical injury or death. State v. Szarek, 433 A.2d 193, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1234 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The circumstances support a reasonable inference that the attorney knew of the collision wherein the attorney was required to stop, to conduct a diligent search for a possible victim and to render reasonable aid. Because the attorney left the scene without a diligent search, disbarment is an appropriate sanction. In re Souls, 669 A.2d 532, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 14 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When one intentionally rams his or her motor vehicle into another motor vehicle occupied by other persons, knowledge of injury to the occupants of that motor vehicle may be inferred. State v. Sabetta, 672 A.2d 451, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 64 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Meaning of “Accident”.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature intended the term “accident” to include all automobile highway collisions — intentional as well as unintentional — where personal injury occurs. State v. Smyth, 121 R.I. 188, 397 A.2d 497, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1759 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The term “accident” in this section includes all collisions, intentional as well as unintentional. Therefore, a defendant can be found guilty of both the intentional act of assault and the act of leaving the scene of an accident. State v. Sabetta, 672 A.2d 451, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 64 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sufficient Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the trial justice indicated he would have trouble finding proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew he had come in contact with the victim, he denied the defendant’s motion for a new trial on the basis that reasonable minds could fairly come to a different conclusion and he could not find the jury’s verdict to be unsupported by the evidence. The trial justice correctly applied the proper standard as there was sufficient evidence along with reasonable inferences flowing therefrom supporting the jury’s finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Bleau, 649 A.2d 215, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 250 (R.I. 1994).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Negligence on the part of the decedent, is not a defense to culpability under this section, unless such negligence can be shown to be the sole proximate cause of the death. State v. Dionne, 442 A.2d 876, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 815 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Negligence of the decedent may be a relevant factor to be considered on the questions of whether the defendant’s conduct was reckless or whether such conduct proximately caused the death. State v. Dionne, 442 A.2d 876, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 815 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When one drives a motor vehicle in violation of the criminal law pertaining to the operation of such a vehicle on a public highway and, in doing so, causes the death of another, the deceased’s negligence is irrelevant absent evidence that would support a finding that the deceased’s conduct amounted to an independent intervening cause. State v. Dionne, 442 A.2d 876, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 815 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for violation of § 31-26-1 and this section, where the defendant’s conduct was clearly a proximate cause of the victim’s death, and where the victim’s conduct could not be held to be the sole proximate cause of the fatality, the trial justice did not err in instructing the jury not to consider the victim’s conduct in determining whether or not the defendant’s conduct was a proximate cause of death. State v. Watkins, 448 A.2d 1260, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 993 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The contributory negligence of the victim is not a defense to a charge of vehicular homicide that is a proximate result of the reckless operation of a motor vehicle. State v. Northup, 486 A.2d 589, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 418 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a case alleging the offense of driving so as to endanger with death resulting, the negligence of the victim is irrelevant unless it can be found that the conduct of the victim is an independent, intervening, and efficient cause of his or her own death which constitutes the sole proximate cause of the fatality. In this case, the conduct of the defendant in swerving into the breakdown land and striking the victim, who was clearly visible from one-half to one-eighth mile from the point of impact, was the proximate cause of the fatality. Therefore, the trial court was correct in refusing to give an instruction about the direction joggers are required to run. State v. Harrington, 689 A.2d 399, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 26 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Culpability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mere error in judgment by a driver is not sufficient for conviction under this section; neither is the negligence that could support a civil action on damages. State v. Dionne, 442 A.2d 876, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 815 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To constitute recklessness, conduct must constitute more than mere error in judgment by the driver and more than the negligence necessary to support a civil action for damages, and the fact that a defendant drove at an excessive speed does not necessarily establish reckless driving. State v. Watkins, 448 A.2d 1260, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 993 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The family court was correct in its finding of delinquency against the defendant, who was driving seventeen miles above the speed limit and was reckless in his driving when he struck the elderly victim. In re David P., 697 A.2d 1099, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 234 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where accused operated his auto with a defective seat inferentially impairing his ability to be certain of control at the maximum rate of speed in a built-up area at a street intersection; accelerated to maximum speed within a relatively short distance under weather conditions that to a prudent driver would suggest caution; admitted to not seeing deceased when he was directly in his path and only a few feet away; and where his car continued to travel after the moment of impact for 148 feet, there was no lack of sufficiency in the evidence. State v. Lisi, 105 R.I. 516, 253 A.2d 239, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 782 (1969).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s acquittal on charge of driving under the influence of liquor does not preclude the introduction of such evidence in the trial of defendant for driving so as to endanger, death resulting. State v. Amaral, 109 R.I. 379, 285 A.2d 783, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 1196 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not err when he allowed into evidence the hospital records pertaining to the defendant’s physical condition in regard to the blood-alcohol level, where the defendant had previously testified he was sober. State v. Boss, 490 A.2d 34, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 468 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although this section does not explicitly require that a defendant consent to the taking of a blood test before that test may be introduced as evidence, the consent provisions of § 31-27-2 apply. State v. Timms, 505 A.2d 1132, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 416 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since it is incumbent upon the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the element of causing the deaths of victims in a charge of driving to endanger, death resulting, the use of a photograph to show the cause of death was proper, even though the defendant had stipulated that his truck caused the deaths. State v. Bettencourt, 723 A.2d 1101, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 2 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Heedless Indifference.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The crucial element in reckless driving offenses is evidence which shows that the driver was embarked upon a course of conduct which demonstrates a heedless indifference to the consequences of his action. State v. Arnold, 122 R.I. 118, 404 A.2d 490, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2071 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To satisfy the requirements for conviction under this section, intent need not be proven. State v. Lisi, 105 R.I. 516, 253 A.2d 239, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 782 (1969).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Intentional conduct, not intentional harm, is what is proscribed by the reckless homicide statute. State v. Bettencourt, 723 A.2d 1101, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 2 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Joint Trial With DUI Charge.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the defendant was being tried for both driving so as to endanger and driving under the influence of alcohol (§ 31-27-2), the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in refusing to conduct a pretrial hearing on the intoxication issue or in denying the defendant’s motion to sever. State v. Northup, 486 A.2d 589, 1985 R.I. LEXIS 418 (R.I. 1985).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Out-Of-State Convictions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the evidence appears to indicate that the defendant’s conduct for which he was convicted of negligent homicide by vehicle in Massachusetts amounted to no more than ordinary negligence, the appeals panel did not err in refusing to impose upon the defendant a more severe suspension requiring reckless disregard. State v. Acciardo, 693 A.2d 1042, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 150 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sentence Appropriate.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant failed to show that his sentence was unduly severe or that circumstances had changed so as to require a reduction in sentence since the record showed that the trial justice had considered numerous factors in making her sentencing decision and that defendant’s possession of a CDL license was only one of them, especially as courts are permitted to consider the training, skills and licensing of defendants in determining sentences. State v. Bettencourt, 766 A.2d 391, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 54 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Status of Fetus.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Unreasonable Risk of Harm.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The question of whether driver was driving in “willful” or “wanton” disregard of the safety of others was whether there was a conscious and intentional driving that the driver knew or should have known created an unreasonable risk of harm to others even though he had no actual intent to harm them. State v. Lisi, 105 R.I. 516, 253 A.2d 239, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 782 (1969).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that an operator of a motor vehicle has violated some statutory prohibition or rule of the road does not in and of itself warrant the bringing of a charge of reckless homicide. State v. Lunt, 106 R.I. 379, 260 A.2d 149, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 639 (1969); State v. Arnold, 122 R.I. 118, 404 A.2d 490, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2071 (1979).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence presented by the prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the foundational requirements established by R.I. Gen.

Evid. 104(a), such that denial of defendant’s motion in limine to exclude the breathalyzer test results, granting the prosecution’s motion in limine to admit those results, and denying defendant’s suppresision motion was proper; defendant offered no evidence to rebut the prosecution’s evidence concerning the foundational requirements.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a trial court properly deferred to the Department of Health’s interpretation of its own regulations and it was probable that defendant’s blood alcohol level was higher than reported by the breath test, it correctly rejected defendant’s arguments that a blood alcohol result should be suppressed in regard to a R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no fundamental constitutional right to drive on the highways; it is a right subject to reasonable control and regulation rationally related to legitimate state interests.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statutory suspension provision of this section effectuates the state’s vital interest and does not impermissibly impose an element of coercion on the actual consent that defendant must first give before the test results may be admitted in a driving-under-the-influence trial.

<p class="p7"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A lawful stop on suspicion of driving under the influence triggers the application of this section. Therefore, when the arresting officer clearly had a reasonable suspicion that the defendant was under the influence, and the defendant refused to take a breathalyzer test, it was error to dismiss the breathalyzer-refusal charge based on the defendant’s claim that his erratic driving and other conduct were the results of medication and not of alcohol consumption. State v. Bruno, 709 A.2d 1048, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 131 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Traffic tribunal’s dismissal of defendant’s infraction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-27-2.3 for refusal to submit to a preliminary breath test did not collaterally estop superior court prosecution for refusal to submit to a chemical test under R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-27-2.1, because (1) while the State had to prove an officer reasonably believed an operator operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs for both crimes, there was no identity of issues, as an operator’s post-arrest behavior irrelevant to the infraction was highly relevant to the chemical test refusal, and (2) the issue as to which defendant sought collateral estoppel was not fully litigated when the traffic tribunal magistrate did not make a specific finding on a material matter of fact. State v. Pacheco, 161 A.3d 1166, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 87 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Appeals.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>District Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the State’s appeal of a decision of the appeals panel of the Traffic Tribunal; R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A motorist can be charged with refusal to take a breathalyzer test when the driving episode takes place in his driveway. Gentile v. Gill, 560 A.2d 327, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 116 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The suspension of a motorist’s registration because of his refusal to submit to a chemical breath test, without any warning that as a consequence of the refusal the motorist’s registration would be suspended, and without the opportunity of a prior hearing, is a denial of due process, and the registration suspension should be voided; however, where the motorist is adequately informed of other penalties he could incur because of his failure to submit to the breathalyzer test, those penalties and the violation should be affirmed. Brown v. Rhode Island Dep't of Transp., 638 A.2d 1052, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Consent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The implied consent codified in this section is applicable only in license revocation proceedings, whereas consent within the meaning of § 31-27-2 must be actual and may not be implied, and the state has the burden of demonstrating that the consent was freely and knowingly given, uninduced by not only actual but implied duress. State v. Berker, 120 R.I. 849, 391 A.2d 107, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 733 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution under § 31-27-2, it was error to exclude breathalyzer test results on the basis that the defendant’s consent to the test was not valid because he was not advised that an out-of-state conviction of driving under the influence could be used to enhance the penalty for a subsequent Rhode Island conviction for the same offense. State ex rel. Town of Middletown v. Anthony, 713 A.2d 207, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 180 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Suspension of defendant’s driver’s license due to driving under the influence of liquor could be effected without certification of the competency of breathalyzer operator. Vinal v. Petit, 112 R.I. 787, 316 A.2d 497, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1508 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The findings at a hearing pursuant to subsection (b) may be made upon whatever evidence is adduced at the hearing and are not dependent upon the validity of the sworn report required by subsection (a). Subsection (b), moreover, does not require a hearing judge to find that the sworn report complied with subsection (a). Therefore, the proper procedure under subsection (b) would have provided the state an opportunity to establish the facts necessary under subsection (b) to sustain the driver’s breathalyzer refusal charge notwithstanding the defect in the sworn report. However, where the hearing judge, relying solely upon the sworn report, chose to dismiss the charge prior to taking any evidence, including the state’s evidence that the driver had in fact been informed of the correct fee, error of law was committed. Link v. State, 633 A.2d 1345, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 254 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Lawfulness of Stop.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state is not required to establish that there existed probable cause for the police to stop a vehicle in order to meet its burden of proof under this section. It is clear that reasonable suspicion is the proper standard for evaluating the lawfulness of a stop. State v. Jenkins, 673 A.2d 1094, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 124 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the police officer testified that he noticed the defendant’s vehicle twice drift over the center line of the highway upon which she was traveling, both times her vehicle’s left wheels contacting the chatterstrip, and the officer also saw the defendant’s vehicle undertake wide turns while both entering and exiting a parking lot, the facts were sufficient to support a finding by the Administrative Adjudication Court of reasonable suspicion that the defendant had been operating her vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. State v. Jenkins, 673 A.2d 1094, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 124 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant’s commission of a misdemeanor alone (operation of a unregistered vehicle in violation of § 31-8-2) gave the officer probable cause to stop and detain him, and from that point on, any evidence obtained pursuant to the lawful stop, such as the odor of alcohol, slurred speech, and bloodshot eyes, would in effect be in plain view of the arresting officer and would support an arrest for suspicion of driving while under the influence. State v. Bjerke, 697 A.2d 1069, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 221 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Legislative Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature included the consent requirement to prevent a violent confrontation between an arresting officer and a suspect unwilling to submit to a test of this sort. State v. Locke, 418 A.2d 843, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1804 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Persons who had been stopped by police officers and suspected of driving under the influence were not entitled to a declaratory judgment, under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>R.I.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> When a law enforcement officer has reason to believe that a person is driving or in actual physical control of any motor vehicle in this state while under the influence of alcohol, the law enforcement officer may require the person to submit to a preliminary breath analysis for the purpose of determining the person’s blood alcohol content. The breath analysis must be administered immediately upon the law enforcement officer’s formulation of a reasonable belief that the person is driving or in actual control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, or immediately upon the stop of the person, whichever is later in time. Any chemical breath analysis required under this section must be administered with a device and in a manner approved by the director of the department of health for that purpose. The result of a preliminary chemical breath analysis may be used for the purpose of guiding the officer in deciding whether an arrest should be made. When a driver is arrested following a preliminary breath analysis, tests may be taken pursuant to § 31-27-2.1. The results of a preliminary breath test may not be used as evidence in any administrative or court proceeding involving driving while intoxicated or refusing to take a breathalyzer test, except as evidence of probable cause in making the initial arrest.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> If a person refuses, upon a lawful request of a law enforcement officer, to submit to a test under subsection (a) of this section, that person shall be guilty of an infraction and shall be subject to the penalty provided in § 31-41.1-4.

<p class="p7"><b>Construction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The phrase “caused by the operation of any motor vehicle” in subsection (a) requires the state to prove that the defendant’s manner of operating his or her motor vehicle was a proximate cause of the injury in question. State v. Benoit, 650 A.2d 1230, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 289 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court erred in dismissing the charges against defendant for driving under the influence of liquor resulting in serious bodily injury, driving so as to endanger resulting in serious bodily injury, and driving with a revoked license because an operator may be distinct and separate from a driver in certain circumstances, and by forcibly seizing control of a moving vehicle when he jumped up from the backseat and grabbed the steering wheel—thus divesting the driver of control—and steering the vehicle off the highway, causing a roll-over crash, defendant placed himself squarely in the realm of an operator of a vehicle. State v. Peters, 172 A.3d 156, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 107 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Not Sufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for post-conviction relief because the alleged new evidence would not have changed the verdict at trial; it was of no consequence that defendant’s obstructive sleep apnea might have caused him to operate a motor vehicle dangerously even if he were not under the influence of alcohol because defendant acknowledged in open court that he was legally intoxicated when he caused the deaths of two people through the operation of his motor vehicle. Reise v. State, 913 A.2d 1052, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 12 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since there was scant evidence in the record, other than his presence on the highway, to show that the defendant’s manner of driving was a proximate cause of the death and injury in question and, in fact, there was evidence that the defendant tried to swerve out of the way of an oncoming car, the legally intoxicated defendant was not criminally responsible for the accident. State v. Benoit, 650 A.2d 1230, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 289 (R.I. 1994).</p>

<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b) (1)</b> The motor vehicle taken or detained under this section shall not be repleviable, but shall be deemed to be in the custody of the law enforcement agency making the seizure. Whenever a motor vehicle is forfeited under this chapter it shall be retained and utilized by the law enforcement agency that seized the vehicle where the use of the vehicle is reasonably related to the law enforcement duties of the seizing agency. If the seized vehicle is inappropriate for use by law enforcement agency for reasons including, but not limited to, style, size, or color, the seizing agency shall be allowed to apply the proceeds of sale or the trade-in value of the vehicle towards the purchase of an appropriate vehicle for use for activities reasonably related to law enforcement duties.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(ii)</b> Each state or local law enforcement agency shall be entitled to keep the proceeds from sales of forfeited vehicles. The funds shall be used for law enforcement purposes. The funds received by a state law enforcement agency shall be maintained in a separate account by the general treasurer. The funds received by a local law enforcement agency shall be maintained in a separate account by the local agency’s city or town treasurer.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Each law enforcement agency making any seizure(s) which result(s) in a forfeiture pursuant to this section shall certify and file with the state treasurer between January 1 and January 30 an annual report detailing the vehicle or money forfeited during the previous calendar year and the use or disposition of the property or money. The report shall be made in the form and manner that may be provided or specified by the treasurer and the annual law enforcement agency reports as provided in this subsection shall be provided to the local governmental body governing the agency and to the house and senate judiciary committees.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Any law enforcement agency whose duty it is to enforce the laws of this state is empowered to authorize designated officers or agents to carry out the seizure provisions of this chapter. It shall be the duty of any officer or agent so authorized or designated or authorized by law, upon or by means of which any violation of this chapter has taken place or is taking place, to seize the vehicle and to place it in the custody of the person who is authorized or designated for that purpose by the respective law enforcement agency pursuant to those provisions.</p>

<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b) (1)</b> The court may, upon application of the attorney general, enter a restraining order or injunction, require any person claiming any interest in the subject vehicle to execute a satisfactory performance bond to the state, or take any other action to preserve the availability of the vehicle subject to forfeiture described in § 31-27-4.3, whether prior or subsequent to the filing of a complaint, indictment, or information.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(ii)</b> The need to preserve the availability of the vehicle through the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship on any party against whom the order is to be entered.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c) (1)</b> A temporary restraining order under this section may be entered upon application of the attorney general without notice or opportunity for a hearing when a complaint, information, or indictment has not yet been filed with respect to the vehicle if the attorney general demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle with respect to which the order is sought would, in the event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under § 31-27-4.3 and that provision of notice will jeopardize the availability of the vehicle for forfeiture. The temporary restraining order shall expire within ten (10) days of the date on which it is entered unless extended for good cause shown or unless the party against whom it is entered consents to an extension for a longer period.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> A hearing requested by any party in interest concerning an order entered under this subsection shall be held at the earliest possible time and prior to the expiration of the temporary order.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Enter appropriate restraining orders or injunctions;</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> All right, title, and interest in the vehicle described in § 31-27-4.1 vests in the state upon the commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this chapter. Any such vehicle that is subsequently transferred to any person may be the subject of a special verdict of forfeiture and shall be ordered forfeited to the state, unless the transferee establishes in a hearing pursuant to subsection (f) of this section that he or she is a bona fide purchaser for value of the vehicle who at the time of purchase was reasonably without cause to believe that the vehicle was subject to forfeiture.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Procedures subsequent to the special verdict of forfeiture shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Following the entry of an order of forfeiture under this section, the state shall publish notice of the order and of its intent to dispose of the vehicle once per week for at least three (3) weeks in any manner that the attorney general may provide by regulation.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The petition shall be signed by the petitioner under penalty of perjury and shall set forth the nature and extent of the petitioner’s right, title, or interest in the vehicle; any additional facts supporting the petitioner’s claim; and the relief sought.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> The hearing on the petition shall, to the extent practicable and consistent with the interest of justice, be held within thirty (30) days of the filing of the petition.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> At a hearing, the petitioner may testify and present evidence and witnesses on his or her own behalf, and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing. The state may present evidence and witnesses in rebuttal and in defense of its claim to the vehicle and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing. In addition to testimony and evidence presented at the hearing, the court shall consider the relevant portions of the record of the criminal case that resulted in the order of forfeiture.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> In accordance with its findings at the hearing, the court shall amend the order of forfeiture if it determines that the petitioner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that:</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> In order to facilitate the identification or location of the vehicle declared forfeited and to facilitate the disposition of petitions filed pursuant to this section after the entry of an order declaring a vehicle forfeited to the state, the court may, upon application of the attorney general, order that the testimony of any witness relating to the forfeited vehicle be taken by deposition and that any designated book, paper, document, record, recording (electronic or otherwise), or other material not privileged, be produced at the same time and place, in the same manner as provided for the taking of depositions under the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> If the vehicle described in § 31-27-4.1: (1) cannot be located; (2) has been transferred to, sold to or deposited with a third party; (3) has been placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court; (4) has been substantially diminished in value by any act or omission of the defendant; the court shall order the forfeiture of any other property of the defendant up to the value of the subject property.</p>

<p class="p6">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that aggressive driving causes two-thirds (2/3) of fatal accidents and one-third (1/3) of all accidents. The general assembly finds that aggressive driving has become a significant public safety concern in recent years and specific legislation designed to severely curtail this problem driving behavior is in the public interest.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Persons, as defined in subsection (h) of this section, upon application and proof of permanent or long-term disability to the division of motor vehicles, shall be issued one motor vehicle disability parking privilege placard or in the case of a motorcycle, one motor vehicle sticker, of blue which shall be imprinted with the white international symbol of access, certificate number, the words “Rhode Island Disability Parking Permit” and shall bear the expiration date upon its face. A placard or motorcycle sticker issued to a person whose disability is temporary shall be substantially similar to that issued to a person with a permanent or long term disability. The temporary placard, however, shall be a red placard with a white international symbol of access, certificate number, the words “Rhode Island Disability Parking Permit” and shall bear the expiration dates upon its face. A preliminary placard shall be similar to that issued to a person with a permanent, long-term, or temporary disability. The preliminary placard shall be effective for twenty-one (21) days, and may be issued by an applicant’s licensed physician, if in the medical provider’s opinion the applicant’s medical condition merits the issuance of a preliminary placard while the division considers the applicant’s qualifications for any type of disability parking permit. The preliminary placard shall be an orange placard with a white international symbol of access, certificate number, the words “Rhode Island Disability Parking Permit” and shall bear the expiration date upon its face and shall be displayed on the dashboard of the vehicle in a manner that it is clearly visible from the front. The division of motor vehicles shall promulgate rules governing the issuance and use of preliminary placards. Applicants shall not be charged any fee associated with the issuance of a preliminary placard. Physicians submitting false information to the division of motor vehicles to obtain a preliminary placard on anyone’s behalf may be subject to the penalties set forth in § 11-18-1.3. Persons issued a placard or motorcycle sticker pursuant to this section shall be entitled to the immunities of §§ 31-28-4 and 31-28-6. The placard shall conform to the Uniform Parking System for Disabled Drivers standard issued by the United States Department of Transportation. If an application for a placard or motorcycle sticker is denied, the division of motor vehicles shall promptly notify the applicant in writing, stating the specific reason(s) for the denial, and advising the applicant of the procedures for requesting a hearing to appeal the denial. Prior to the appeal hearing, the applicant shall be provided with any and all documents relied upon by the division in denying the application. If an application contains a physician certification that the applicant is sufficiently disabled to require a placard or motorcycle sticker, and the division has not provided specific reasons in its denial letter to the applicant, the hearing officer shall summarily order that a placard or motorcycle sticker be provided to the applicant. At all other hearings of application denials where a physician certification has been provided, the division shall bear the burden of proof that the individual is not entitled to a placard or motorcycle sticker pursuant to this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> A placard issued pursuant to this section shall be portable and used only when the person is being transported. The placard is to be hung from the rear view mirror so as to be seen through the front or rear windshield of the motor vehicle. A placard may be issued to a person with a disability who does not own a motor vehicle, to be used only when he or she is being transported. A motorcycle sticker issued pursuant to this section shall not be portable and shall be affixed to the rear plate of the motorcycle.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c) (1)</b> The certificate of entitlement to the placard or motorcycle sticker shall be renewed every six (6) years for individuals with a long-term disability, as defined in subsection (d) of this section, and the renewal application shall require a physician’s certification that the condition has not changed since the previous approval, and six (6) years for individuals with a permanent disability as defined in subsection (h) of this section, in accordance with a schedule prepared by the division of motor vehicles that uses the last name of an individual to determine the month of renewal. If an application or subsequent renewal is accompanied by a physician’s certification that the applicant’s condition is a chronic, permanent impairment and that application is approved, then any subsequent renewal shall be authorized upon receipt of a notarized affidavit from the applicant or applicant’s, guardian or legal representative or a certificate from the applicant’s physician that his or her condition has not changed since the previous approval.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The certificate of entitlement to the placard or motorcycle sticker shall be covered with plastic or similar material. The applicant shall, upon timely renewal, receive a sticker bearing the expiration date of the certificate of entitlement to be affixed across the expiration date of the disability parking privilege placard or in the case of a motorcycle the applicant shall receive a new motorcycle sticker. The division of motor vehicles shall establish rules and regulations allowing for the renewal of the certificates of entitlement by mail.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Whenever the division of motor vehicles proposes to suspend, revoke or fail to renew the certificate of entitlement for noncompliance with the requirements of this section or for violation of subsection (h) of this section, the individual shall first be entitled to a hearing before the division of motor vehicles to contest the proposed action. At the hearing, the division of motor vehicles shall bear the burden of proof that the individual is not entitled to the placard or motorcycle sticker pursuant to this chapter. There shall be no renewal fee charged for the placards or motorcycle sticker. The division of motor vehicles shall be authorized to issue a temporary disability parking privilege placard or motorcycle sticker immediately upon receipt of an application for individuals with a temporary impairment, as defined in subsection (h) of this section. A temporary placard or motorcycle sticker shall be valid for sixty (60) days from the date of issuance. Temporary placards or motorcycle stickers may be renewed for a period of one year or less, as determined by the medical advisory board upon application if the disability persists. The division of motor vehicles shall subsequently review the applications in accordance with the procedures currently in effect as to applications from persons whose disability is long term. Any issuance which, after subsequent review, shall be found to be inappropriate shall be revoked and notice of the revocation shall be sent to the applicant.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> A person, other than a person with a disability, who for his or her own purposes uses the parking privilege placard, shall be fined five hundred dollars ($500) for each violation. A person issued a special placard who uses the placard after expiration, or who shall allow unauthorized use of the disability parking placard or sticker, may be subject to immediate revocation of the use of the placard by the division of motor vehicles, and subject to a fine of five hundred dollars ($500).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Disability parking spaces shall be designated and identified by the posting of signs above ground level incorporating the international symbol of access of white on blue, and the words “Handicapped Parking,” “Disability Parking,” “Disabled Parking,” or “Reserved Parking” at each space, at both ends of a row or series of adjacent disability parking spaces, or at the entrance to a parking lot restricted to only disability parking.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> A person, other than a person issued a special placard or motorcycle sticker pursuant to this section, who parks a vehicle in a parking space designated for persons with disabilities, shall be fined: (1) one hundred dollars ($100) for a first violation, (2) one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175) for a second violation, and (3) three hundred twenty-five dollars ($325) for a third or subsequent violation. The vehicle may be subject to towing at the owner’s expense. Provided further, that it shall not be unlawful for a person to park a vehicle in a space designated for person with disabilities if that person is transporting a person who has been issued a special placard and is properly displaying the placard on the vehicle.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> Enforcement of the parking provisions of this section shall be enforced by the local or state authorities on public or private property when the location of the parking spaces is within the purview of the State Building Code, chapter 27.3 of title 23.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A prospective purchaser driving a car, with the permission of the dealer-owner, to test it and determine whether or not he wished to buy it was the bailee of such car and not the agent of the dealer. Redding v. Picard Motor Sales, Inc., 403 F.2d 788, 1968 U.S. App. LEXIS 4813 (1st Cir. 1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not make a bailee the agent of the owner. Ford v. Dorcus, 54 R.I. 1, 168 A. 814, 1933 R.I. LEXIS 1 (1933); Goulet v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 83 R.I. 310, 116 A.2d 178, 1955 R.I. LEXIS 59 (1955).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Son living at home and using family vehicle for social purposes was not a bailee, so was father’s agent under this section. Emond v. Fallon, 56 R.I. 419, 186 A. 15, 1936 R.I. LEXIS 113 (1936).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant seeking to avoid liability under this section on ground that operator was a bailee has burden of proof as to bailment. Gallo v. American Egg Co., 76 R.I. 450, 72 A.2d 166, 1950 R.I. LEXIS 19 (1950).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fact that owner’s agent was riding in front seat did not prevent garageman’s operation of vehicle from being that of a bailee. Goulet v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 83 R.I. 310, 116 A.2d 178, 1955 R.I. LEXIS 59 (1955).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action against an automobile dealer under this section for damages from the operation of an automobile owned by him, where the evidence was that the person who drove the automobile out of the dealer’s place of business had previously road-tested it and another automobile with a view to purchasing one of them and, on the occasion of the accident had road-tested said other automobile before taking out the one involved in the accident, the inference that possession of the car was under agreement of bailment is of such probability as to negative the probative force of the inference reached by the trial court that such possession was merely by consent of the owner and that the operator was the agent of the owner under this section. Redding v. Picard Motor Sales, 102 R.I. 239, 229 A.2d 762, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 677 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a defendant, alleged to be the owner of an automobile involved in a collision, averred without contradiction that, at the time of the alleged collision, the automobile was bailed for repair and being operated by the employee of the bailee without the knowledge or consent of the defendant. Defendant’s motion for summary judgment was properly granted. Battista v. Muscatelli, 106 R.I. 514, 261 A.2d 636, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 953 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Consent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was sufficient evidence to establish that the car in question was registered to defendant and was driven by an employee of defendant, the burden was upon defendant to prove that it was done so without his consent and where there was evidence that the employee had previously been dismissed for the day for intoxication, the question was for the jury to determine. Budwee v. New England Motors, 99 R.I. 663, 210 A.2d 131, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 499 (1965).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A judgment in favor of a Rhode Island motorist against a Connecticut automobile dealer, whose car was involved in a collision in Rhode Island, is set aside, and a new trial ordered, where it can not be determined, upon the record, whether the dealer consented to the car’s being driven in Rhode Island. Ostrosky v. Sczapa, 868 F.2d 1, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 1378 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section abrogates the common-law rule that shielded an automobile owner from liability for the negligence of a person to whom the vehicle was entrusted unless such negligence occurred while the operator was engaged in the owner’s business. It predicates the owner’s liability on the granting of permission to use a potentially dangerous instrumentality. Ostrosky v. Sczapa, 739 F. Supp. 715, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8694 (D.R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Connecticut automobile dealer is not liable for the negligent operation of its vehicle in Rhode Island by its salesman’s brother, where there is no evidence that the dealer consented to the brother’s operation of the car or that it consented to the car being operated in Rhode Island.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Limiting instructions given by the officer of the personal injury claimant’s employer did not free the owner of liability under R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-33-6, where the owner had given the driver, an employee, permisison to operate the vehicle for work purposes, the prohibition by an officer of the vehicle owner against interim use was immaterial. Black v. Vaiciulis, 934 A.2d 216, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 107 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In vehicle owner 1’s action for damages stemming from a collision, R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 31-33-6 and 31-33-7, a trial court erred in granting summary judgment to vehicle owner 2 because she was the vehicle’s registered owner at the time of the collision, which served as prima facie evidence under § 31-33-7 that she gave consent to the unidentified driver to use her vehicle and owner 2’s submission of an affidavit and a police report created conflicting evidence on the issue of consent, which was a question for a jury to resolve. Pichardo v. Stevens, 55 A.3d 762, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 139 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Contributory Negligence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section applies to plaintiffs as well as to defendants and requires that a plaintiff alleging that its vehicle was operated with its consent also allege that the operator was free from contributory negligence. Davis Pontiac Co. v. Sirois, 82 R.I. 32, 105 A.2d 792, 1954 R.I. LEXIS 7 (1954).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Deviation From Owner’s Business.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Owner who consented to use of vehicle, either expressly or by implication, was responsible for acts of operator even on unauthorized deviation from the owner’s business. Guerin v. Mongeon, 49 R.I. 414, 143 A. 674, 1928 R.I. LEXIS 78 (1928); Massart v. Narragansett Elec. Co., 54 R.I. 154, 171 A. 238, 1934 R.I. LEXIS 29 (1934); F. D. McKendall Lumber Co. v. Ramieri, 85 R.I. 92, 126 A.2d 560, 1956 R.I. LEXIS 123 (1956).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Owner was not liable for injuries caused by employee using vehicle for his own purposes in violation of express prohibition, even though employee had authority to use it for other purposes. Smith v. Tompkins, 52 R.I. 434, 161 A. 221, 1932 R.I. LEXIS 86 (1932).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Exclusionary rule which bars the use of hearsay applies no less to out-of-court utterances which are offered to prove an owner’s consent than it does to those which are offered to establish an agency relationship between owner and operator of vehicle. Gilbert v. Girard, 109 R.I. 68, 279 A.2d 919, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1025 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Lessees.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Owner was not liable for negligence of lessee or lessee’s agent. Badway v. Columbia Motor Mileage Corp., 75 R.I. 39, 63 A.2d 217, 1949 R.I. LEXIS 5 (1949).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the explicit language of R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-33-6, regarding the liability of a vehicle owner for the negligence of someone driving the vehicle with permission, it is irrelevant whether the owner (the person holding title to the vehicle) is a long-term lessor or a short-term rental agency. Oliveira v. Lombardi, 794 A.2d 453, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 62 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-33-6 extended liability to an owner or lessee for the negligence of a user who drove with permission, it excepted drivers who provided proof of financial responsibility and since the son owned his own vehicle and had provided such proof, the car lessee, the mother, was not subject to vicarious liability for any negligence on the son’s part. Regan v. Nissan N. Am., 810 A.2d 255, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 223 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Owner.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Legislative intent in this section was to give to the word “owner” an expanded meaning so as to include those, who though without legal title, do have lawful possession and control thereof, as for example the vendee under a conditional sale. Avedesian v. Butler Auto Sales, 93 R.I. 4, 170 A.2d 604, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 71 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “owner” as used in this statute is to be given a broad comprehensive meaning consistent with its purpose and includes those who by reason of being lawfully in possession of a motor vehicle may give a valid consent to another to use or operate the car. Avedesian v. Butler Auto Sales, 93 R.I. 4, 170 A.2d 604, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 71 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While an automobile salesman who lawfully came into possession of an automobile would be the owner, under the provisions of this section he would not be the owner if he was an agent acting for the dealer and if such action was within the scope of his authority. Avedesian v. Butler Auto Sales, 93 R.I. 4, 170 A.2d 604, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 71 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a defendant used his employer’s “in transit” plate on his personal car contrary to statutory prohibitions, the defendant’s employer was not an owner or possessor of the defendant’s car within the meaning of this section. Pray v. Narragansett Improvement Co., 434 A.2d 923, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1262 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Vehicle lessors, as legal titleholders and registered owners of the vehicles, are “owners” of the vehicles under R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-33-6, and therefore subject to its vicarious liability provisions. Oliveira v. Lombardi, 794 A.2d 453, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 62 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Short-term car rental agencies, long-term leasing companies, and motor-vehicle financing corporations are subject to tort liability under R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 31-33-6 and 31-34-4 as the owners of motor vehicles under these vicarious liability statutes. Oliveira v. Lombardi, 794 A.2d 453, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 62 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Language of R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-33-6 is clear: an owner, having consented to the use of its vehicle by another driver, is liable for the negligence of that driver unless the driver shall have furnished proof of financial responsibility in the amount set forth in R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 31, chapter 32, prior to an accident. Oliveira v. Lombardi, 794 A.2d 453, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 62 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For consenting owners of vehicles leased long-term to protect themselves from liability under R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-33-6 for the negligence of someone driving the vehicle with permission, the authorized drivers of the leased vehicles must have provided proof of financial responsibility before the accident occurred. Oliveira v. Lombardi, 794 A.2d 453, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 62 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence was insufficient to survive an insurer’s motion for judgment as a matter of law in a victim’s action alleging liability under the statute because the victim’s injuries resulted from a physical altercation with the driver of the insured vehicle at a distance from the vehicle and unrelated to the operation of the vehicle; the mere fact that the driver drove to and from the scene of the incident in the insured vehicle did not establish the causal connection required to impute liability. Hough v. McKiernan, 108 A.3d 1030, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 11 (R.I. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Statute imposes vicarious liability upon the owner of a motor vehicle for the acts, intentional as well as unintentional, of anyone using or operating the vehicle with the consent of the owner; a plaintiff carries the burden, however, of establishing a causal relationship between the use of the vehicle and the injuries sustained by the plaintiff. Hough v. McKiernan, 108 A.3d 1030, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 11 (R.I. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Statutory language does not impute liability upon the owner of a motor vehicle for all acts of a permissive driver, particularly those that are not related to the operation of the vehicle; rather, there must be a causal relationship between the operation or use of the vehicle and the injuries sustained by the plaintiff. Hough v. McKiernan, 108 A.3d 1030, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 11 (R.I. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Principal-Agent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant-husband’s liability was not as a tortfeasor but principal for a tortfeasor agent, defendant-husband was an indispensable party having an interest in the controversy of such a nature that any final decree would affect that interest, and by joinder of owner and driver, diversity of citizenship was destroyed which required dismissing action in federal court and maintaining in state court. Codagnone v. Perrin, 351 F. Supp. 1126, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11019 (D.R.I. 1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This statute was not intended to provide a defense based on statutory agency to the operator of a car being sued by the owner/passenger for injuries resulting from a collision which occurred while the operator had the owner’s consent. It is, rather, applicable only in actions where recovery is sought by a third party and was never intended to be a defense in an action brought by a principal against the agent. Mitchell v. Repucci, 514 A.2d 1028, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 538 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Public Highway.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section did not apply to an accident on a private drive even though freely used by the public on invitation of the owner. Pettine v. Tuplin, 71 R.I. 374, 46 A.2d 42, 1946 R.I. LEXIS 7 (1946).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where cause of action arose out of accident on premises of a service station, this section could not be used to establish operator as agent of owner since the accident did not happen on a public highway. Pescosolido v. Crugnale, 93 R.I. 82, 171 A.2d 443, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 83 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a report of a police investigation of an accident referred to the speed limit on a street and contained references to the condition of the street, a reasonable inference could be drawn that the street was a public highway. Budwee v. New England Motors, 99 R.I. 663, 210 A.2d 131, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 499 (1965).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Relationship to Federal Law.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To the extent that this section “impos[es] liability on business entities engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles for failure to meet [Rhode Island’s] financial responsibility or liability insurance requirements”, it is not preempted by the federal Graves Amendment, 49 U.S.C. § 30106, because it falls within the § 30106(b)(2) savings clause of the Graves Amendment. Puerini v. LaPierre, 208 A.3d 1157, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 81 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Release.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since it was absolutely clear that a valid and enforceable contract was formed at the time the parties to the releases exchanged promises, even though the injured persons tried to return the $100,000 settlement payment from the driver’s insurer, the lessor of the car which was involved in the accident was no longer exposed to liability. Davis v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 882 A.2d 557, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 159 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Scope of Agency.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Person operating with the consent of the owner was the agent of the owner so as to bind the owner by consent to the operation of the vehicle by a third person. F. D. McKendall Lumber Co. v. Ramieri, 85 R.I. 92, 126 A.2d 560, 1956 R.I. LEXIS 123 (1956).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant’s liability arose solely by reason of the statutory agency contemplated in this section and for such a finding it would be necessary for jury to find that defendant owned car and that it consented to operation, it was error for court to deny requests for special verdicts on these points. Avedesian v. Butler Auto Sales, 93 R.I. 4, 170 A.2d 604, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 71 (1961).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence of registration of the vehicle in defendant’s name is enough to take the question of consent to the jury even when rebutted. Hill v. Cabral, 62 R.I. 11, 2 A.2d 482, 1938 R.I. LEXIS 2 (1938); Gemma v. Rotondo, 62 R.I. 293, 5 A.2d 297, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 30 (1939); Kent v. Draper Soap Co., 75 R.I. 30, 63 A.2d 571, 1949 R.I. LEXIS 7 (1949).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Independent Contractors.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under former statute evidence that operator was an independent contractor overcame prima facie value of registration so as to make owner not liable for injuries through negligence of operator. Conant v. Giddings, 65 R.I. 79, 13 A.2d 517, 1940 R.I. LEXIS 83 (1940).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Invited Passengers.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence of registration of vehicle was prima facie evidence under former statute that operator had power to bind owner by invitation to passenger. Gemma v. Rotondo, 62 R.I. 293, 5 A.2d 297, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 30 (1939).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Registration.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a dealer in motor vehicles attaches his dealer’s plates, so-called, to an automobile owned by him with the intention of operating it on the highways, he thereby registers that automobile in his name and such is a registration within the purview of this section. Avedesian v. Butler Auto Sales, 93 R.I. 4, 170 A.2d 604, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 71 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A defendant’s affidavit that another was the registered owner of the automobile, when uncontroverted by opposing affidavits, entitled him to summary judgment as to implied consent under this section. Battista v. Muscatelli, 106 R.I. 514, 261 A.2d 636, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 953 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Dealers.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section did not apply where the registered owner was a dealer and the driver a prospective purchaser testing the automobile to determine whether or not he wished to purchase it. Redding v. Picard Motor Sales, Inc., 403 F.2d 788, 1968 U.S. App. LEXIS 4813 (1st Cir. 1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Foreign Registration.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section has to do with Rhode Island internal matters, and does not apply to a vehicle which is not registered in Rhode Island and has Connecticut dealer’s plates. Ostrosky v. Sczapa, 868 F.2d 1, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 1378 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— In Transit Plates.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the defendant used his employer’s “in transit” plate on his personal car contrary to statutory prohibition, the defendant’s car was not on the road with the employer’s consent, pursuant to this section. Pray v. Narragansett Improvement Co., 434 A.2d 923, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1262 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Summary Judgment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although there was no evidence of consent to use of automobile, the jury could nevertheless find that consent existed under the provisions of this statute. Avedesian v. Butler Auto Sales, 93 R.I. 4, 170 A.2d 604, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 71 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant has burden of proving that consent to use car was lacking, therefore where an employee of the defendant obtained dealer’s plates from another employee charged with the responsibility of issuing them, attached them to a car, and drove the car to get it filled with gasoline, the jury could find that defendant was the owner of the car, notwithstanding other testimony that the employee had previously been dismissed for the day for intoxication. Budwee v. New England Motors, 99 R.I. 663, 210 A.2d 131, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 499 (1965).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Exclusionary rule which bars the use of hearsay applies no less to out-of-court utterances which are offered to prove an owner’s consent than it does to those which are offered to establish an agency relationship between owner and operator of vehicle. Gilbert v. Girard, 109 R.I. 68, 279 A.2d 919, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1025 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In absence of objections to hearsay evidence, relevant and material, to the question whether driver of automobile involved in collision had obtained owner’s consent to operate it, such hearsay evidence being competent though uncorroborated or contradicted by positive legal testimony, could be accepted by jury. Gilbert v. Girard, 109 R.I. 68, 279 A.2d 919, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1025 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a lessee of a private motor vehicle had submitted an affidavit that her son had lacked permission to drive the vehicle in support of her summary judgment motion in another driver’s negligence action, and the lease did not limit who could drive, the lessee and the lessor had failed to meet their burden on summary judgment sufficient to find that there were no genuine issues of material fact for trial as to the lessee’s son’s permission to operate the leased vehicle. Andreoni v. Ainsworth, 898 A.2d 1240, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 99 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In vehicle owner 1’s action for damages stemming from a collision, R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 31-33-6 and 31-33-7, a trial court erred in granting summary judgment to vehicle owner 2 because she was the vehicle’s registered owner at the time of the collision, which served as prima facie evidence under § 31-33-7 that she gave consent to the unidentified driver to use her vehicle and owner 2’s submission of an affidavit and a police report created conflicting evidence on the issue of consent, which was a question for a jury to resolve. Pichardo v. Stevens, 55 A.3d 762, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 139 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Summary judgment in a personal injury action on the basis of a car rental company’s lack of consent to the operator of rented motor vehicle, who allegedly struck the accident victim with car which the company loaned to another person, was not appropriate in the case because the determination of this issue required factfinding. Marble v. Faelle, 89 A.3d 830, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 61 (R.I. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Use of Section.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rhode Island limits the use of this section to plaintiffs who plead it. Ostrosky v. Sczapa, 868 F.2d 1, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 1378 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not purport to create an independent substantive basis for the owner-lessor’s liability, such as a theory of negligent entrustment. Instead the statute imposes a form of vicarious liability on the owner-lessor based on the operator’s wrongful conduct. DiQuinzio v. Panciera Lease Co., 612 A.2d 40, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 174 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Lessor-liability statute, R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the Division of Motor Vehicles, which is responsible for enforcing R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 31, requires long-term lessors of motor vehicles to provide proof of their financial responsibility before leasing motor vehicles in Rhode Island, and because great weight is attributed to this agency’s construction of R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-34-4, the regulations support the conclusion that long-term lessors are subject to this lessor-liability statute as an additional surety for the satisfaction of a negligence claim.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a tortfeasor rented a car in Rhode Island, the Rhode Island statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-34-4, applied to a personal injury action arising out of an accident in Massachusetts to make the rental companies jointly and severally liable with the tortfeasor; therefore, the rental companies’ motion for summary judgment was denied. Newcomb v. Haywood, 15 Mass. L. Rep. 531, 2003 Mass. Super. LEXIS 4 (Mass. Super. Ct. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though actual accident occurred in New York, Rhode Island law, which precluded liability on the rental car company when the car was driven outside of the terms and conditions of the rental car agreement, was applicable because all of the parties involved were Rhode Island residents, the trip was initiated in Rhode Island, and the trip would have ended in Rhode Island. Oyola v. Burgos, 864 A.2d 624, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 13 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since it was absolutely clear that a valid and enforceable contract was formed at the time the parties to the releases exchanged promises, even though the injured persons tried to return the $100,000 settlement payment from the driver’s insurer, the lessor of the car which was involved in the accident was no longer exposed to liability.

Gen. Laws § 31-34-4, imposing liability on “any owner of a for hire motor vehicle or truck” for the negligence of the vehicle’s operators regardless of whether proof of financial responsibility had been provided—and there was no genuine issue of material fact that the owner was engaged in the general business of leasing motor vehicles and had complied with the mandatory insurance requirement to furnish proof of financial responsibility as a condition of operating as a lessor of motor vehicles.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Every hearing for the adjudication of a traffic violation, as provided by this chapter, shall be held before a judge or magistrate of the traffic tribunal or a judge of the municipal court, where provided by law. The burden of proof shall be upon the state, city, or town and no charge may be established except by clear and convincing evidence. A verbatim recording shall be made of all proceedings. The chief magistrate of the traffic tribunal may prescribe, by rule or regulation, the procedures for the conduct of the hearings and for pre-hearing discovery.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> After due consideration of the evidence and arguments, the judge or magistrate shall determine whether the charges have been established, and appropriate findings of fact shall be made on the record. If the charges are not established, an order dismissing the charges shall be entered. If a determination is made that a charge has been established or if an answer admitting the charge has been received, an appropriate order shall be entered in the records of the traffic tribunal.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> An order entered after the receipt of an answer admitting the charge or where a determination is made that the charge has been established shall be civil in nature, and shall be treated as an adjudication that a violation has been committed. A judge or magistrate may include in the order the imposition of any penalty authorized by any provisions of this title for the violation, including, but not limited to, license suspension, and/or in the case of a motorist under the age of twenty (20), community service, except that no penalty for it shall include imprisonment. A judge or magistrate may order the suspension or revocation of a license or of a registration in the name of the defendant in accordance with any provisions of this title that authorize the suspension or revocation of a license or of a registration, or may order the suspension of the license and the registration of the defendant for the willful failure to pay a fine previously imposed. In addition, after notice and opportunity to be heard, a judge or magistrate may order the suspension of the registration of the vehicle with which the violation was committed, if the defendant has willfully failed to pay a fine previously imposed.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> A judge or magistrate may, as authorized by law, order a motorist to attend a rehabilitative driving course operated under the jurisdiction of a college or university accredited by the state of Rhode Island, or the trained personnel of the department of revenue.

However, the regulations may provide for the immediate surrender of any item to be suspended or revoked and the issuance of appropriate temporary documentation to be used during the thirty-day (30) period.

<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The burden of proof is proof by clear and convincing evidence, while the burden in a civil case is a preponderance of the evidence. Since the burden is greater than in a superior court civil action, the dismissal of a traffic charge may merely mean that the state or the concerned municipality has failed to satisfy the more rigorous burden, rather than that the specific act charged did not occur. Consequently, evidence concerning the ultimate disposition of the traffic charge is properly excluded in a civil case. Cannone v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 471 A.2d 211, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 448 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Composition of Appeals Board.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An appeals board composed entirely of administrative adjudication judges was not legally constituted under § 31-43-4(1) (repealed; see now § 31-41.1-8). Egan v. State DOT, 617 A.2d 876, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 214 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Right to Jury Trial.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fines pursuant to this section are determined by excess weight. A jury has no role in the determination or alteration of the fines, only the determination of whether there was a violation. Such a fact determination does not give rise to a right to trial by jury. Calore Freight Sys. v. Department of Transp., 576 A.2d 1214, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 126 (R.I. 1990).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supporting Reasons for Decision.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The district court has jurisdiction to entertain appeals from the administrative adjudication division (now traffic tribunal) irrespective of the amount of the fines imposed. Richmond Sand &amp; Gravel v. State, 556 A.2d 52, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 44 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Prospective Application.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The unamended version of this section must be applied to motor-vehicle infraction determinations occurring before the 1992 amendment date even though the aggrieved parties appealed on or after that date, since no logic would be served by a retroactive application of the presently amended version. Walsh v. Rhode Island Dep't of Transp., 637 A.2d 774, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 57 (R.I. 1994) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Scope of Review.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In reviewing a hearing judge’s decision pursuant to subsection (l) of former § 31-43-4, the appeals panel lacks the authority to assess witness credibility or to substitute its judgment for that of the hearing judge concerning the weight of evidence on questions of fact. The review of the appeals panel is confined to a reading of the second record to determine whether a judge’s decision is supported by legally competent evidence or is effected by an error of law. Link v. State, 633 A.2d 1345, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 254 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Supreme Court review of appeals panel judgments is authorized by subsection (j) of former § 31-43-4, and it must conform to the standards embodied in subsection (f) of former § 31-43-4. The Supreme Court, accordingly, must determine whether the appeals panel has exceeded its authority under subsection (f) of former § 31-43-4. The appeals panel’s decision will not be reversed unless the court decides that the panel misapplied the law, misconceived or overlooked material evidence, or made findings that were clearly wrong (See now § 31-41.1-9(h)). Link v. State, 633 A.2d 1345, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 254 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Supporting Reasons for Decision.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the issuance of a decision without supporting reasons is discouraged, such a practice clearly comports with subsection (c) of former § 31-43-4, which simply requires the appeal panel, after reviewing an appeal, to file “an appropriate order” in the court records. Link v. State, 633 A.2d 1345, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 254 (R.I. 1993).</p>

However, the park owner may by rule or contract provision impose reasonable limitations as to size, quality registration of the signs, requirements that the posting of the signs be pursuant to bona fide efforts to sell, and removal when the home is no longer being offered for sale. No limitation as to size or quality shall restrict the use of painted or printed signs which are two feet (2´) by two feet (2´) or less in size and which contains no more than “for sale,” “address” and “phone number”.</p>

The director or his or her designee shall take all reasonable action to effectuate prompt resolution of said claim and shall render a decision within fifteen (15) days of the conclusion of said hearing.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> A mobile and manufactured home shall be presumed to be safe if it is established that the mobile and manufactured home was constructed to any nationally recognized building or construction code or standard.

<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> The mobile and manufactured home park owner shall have the burden of showing that a mobile and manufactured home is unsafe, unsanitary, or fails to meet the aesthetic standards of the development. No aesthetic standard shall be applied against a mobile and manufactured home if the standard relates to physical characteristics, such as size, original construction materials, or color which cannot be changed without undue hardship to the tenant.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> Any homeowner wishing to sell his or her home must request in writing a statement of the park owner’s intentions regarding the conditions of the dwelling. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of the request of the homeowner for the park owner’s intentions, the park owner must approve the home’s condition for resale or deliver a written statement specifying ways in which the home is not safe, sanitary, or in conformance with aesthetic standards. Failure of the park owner to respond within ten (10) days shall be deemed approval of the home’s condition for resale.</p>

A fee of not more than thirty dollars ($30.00) may be charged for the inspection by building officials.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(n)</b> Prior to the execution of a purchase and sale agreement, every owner of a mobile and manufactured home park, shall disclose to the prospective purchaser the rental history for the preceding three (3) years of the land on which the home will be located.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(o)</b> The owner of a mobile and manufactured home park shall not require the purchaser to provide the names of more than three (3) references from whom the park owner can seek information concerning the behavior and financial reliability of the purchaser; nor shall the purchaser be required to obtain a written report from any reference; the park owner shall not require the purchaser to submit copies of any personal income tax returns in order to obtain approval for residency in the park. However, the park owner may require the purchaser to document the amount and source of his or her gross monthly income or means of financial support. If the park owner or management rejects a purchaser as a prospective homeowner, the ownership or management shall inform the selling homeowner in writing no later than ten (10) days of its reasons for the rejection. If the approval of a purchaser is withheld for any reason other than those stated in these articles, the park owner or management may be held liable for all damages proximately resulting in it.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(p)</b> The park owner or management may require the right of prior approval of a purchaser of a mobile and manufactured home that will remain in the park and that the selling homeowner or his or her agent give notice of the sale to the park owner or management before the close of the sale. Approval cannot be withheld if the purchaser has the financial ability to pay the rent and charges of the park unless the park owner or management reasonably determines that, based on the purchaser’s prior tenancies, he or she will not comply with the rules and regulations of the park.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(q)</b> If the park owner or management collects a fee or charge from a prospective purchaser of a mobile and manufactured home in order to obtain a financial report or credit rating, the full amount of the fee or charge shall be credited toward payment of the first month’s rent for that mobile and manufactured home purchaser.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(r)</b> If, for whatever reason, the prospective purchaser is rejected by the park owner or management, the park owner or management shall refund to the prospective purchaser the full amount of that fee or charge within thirty (30) days from the date of rejection. If the prospective purchaser is approved by the park owner or management, but, for whatever reason, the prospective purchaser elects not to purchase the mobile or manufactured home, the park owner or management may retain the fee, or a portion of it, to defray its administrative costs under this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(s)</b> No owner or operator of a mobile and manufactured home park shall require any person as a precondition to renting, leasing, or otherwise occupying a space for mobile and manufactured housing in a mobile and manufactured home park to pay any fee of any kind, unless services are actually rendered.

<p class="p7"><b>Liability Insurance.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provision of Subdivision (12)(i) requiring that every owner’s policy of liability insurance must provide coverage for damages arising out of bodily injury to any person invalidate family-exclusion provisions. Glaude v. Continental Ins. Co., 708 A.2d 190, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 112 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the family-exclusion clause of motor insurance had been rendered void by the passage of the mandatory insurance law, all other provisions of the policy, including the liability coverage limit, were to be enforced in a manner consistent with the parties’ intentions and the law. Glaude v. Continental Ins. Co., 708 A.2d 190, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 112 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, § 34A, which allowed Massachusetts insurers to offer automobile insurance coverage which only applied to losses occurring in Massachusetts, as long as optional coverage for losses occurring outside Massachusetts, as required by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 113C, was also offered, did not conflict with the law of Rhode Island, as stated in R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-47-2(13)(i)(A), requiring liability coverage for losses occurring anywhere in North America, or Rhode Island public policy, because neither Rhode Island law or public policy attempted to regulate the contents of insurance policies sold by insurers in other states, so an insured who purchased “Massachusetts-only” coverage and declined additional coverage was not entitled to reformation of his insurance policy when he was involved in an automobile accident in Rhode Island. Mendez v. Brites, 849 A.2d 329, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since prior case law had already determined that public policy concerns did not preclude enforcement of a Massachusetts auto insurance policy limiting liability coverage to accidents that occurred in Massachusetts, the court should have granted an auto insurer’s motion for summary judgment declaring that the insurer did not have to provide coverage for an accident that occurred in Rhode Island; Rhode Island’s own compulsory coverage provisions applied only to cars registered in Rhode Island.

A certificate of self-insurance issued under § 31-33-9 or this section cannot be used to satisfy requirements of § 31-34-1 as the General Assembly intended all owners of rental vehicles to adhere specifically to the requirements of chapter 34 of title 31 and that the possession of self-insurance certificate issued pursuant to a separate statutory provision does not meet the requirements of §§ 31-34-1 and 31-34-2.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, every police officer of a state, town, or municipality is deemed an agent of the administrator of the division of motor vehicles. Any police officer who, in the performance of his or her duties as authorized by law, becomes aware of a person whose license is under an order of suspension, or whose certificate of registration and registration plates are under an order of impoundment, pursuant to this section may confiscate the license, certificate of registration, and registration plates, and return them to the administrator of the division of motor vehicles. Any forms used by law enforcement agencies in administering this section shall be prescribed by the administrator of the division of motor vehicles, the cost of which shall be borne by these agencies. No police officer, law enforcement agency employing a police officer, or political subdivision or governmental agency that employs a police officer shall be liable in a civil action for damages or loss to persons arising out of the performance of the duty required or authorized by this section. “Police officer” means the full-time police from the rank of patrol up to and including the rank of colonel or chief of any police department in any city or town within the state of Rhode Island or of the state police.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> All fees, except court costs, collected under this chapter shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the highway safety fund in a special account hereby created, to be known as the “financial responsibility compliance special account.” This special account shall be used exclusively to cover costs incurred by the division of motor vehicles in the administration of this chapter, and by any law enforcement agency employing any police officer who returns any license, certificate of registration, and registration plates to the administrator of the division of motor vehicles pursuant to this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The administrator of the division of motor vehicles, court, or traffic tribunal may require proof of financial security. A person may demonstrate proof of financial responsibility under this section by presenting to the court, traffic tribunal, or administrator of the division of motor vehicles any of the following documents or a copy of these documents:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> A certificate of proof of financial responsibility;</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> At the time of investigation of a motor vehicle offense or accident by a police officer or when a motor vehicle is stopped by a police officer for probable cause, the police officer making the investigation or stopping the motor vehicle shall ask for evidence of proof of financial security as defined in this chapter. Proof of financial responsibility may be provided using a mobile electronic device; provided, however, that the police officer requiring the proof of financial responsibility shall be prohibited from viewing any other content on the mobile electronic device. Any person utilizing an electronic device to provide proof of insurance shall assume any and all liability for any damage sustained to the mobile electronic device. If the evidence is not provided, a citation to appear before the traffic tribunal shall be issued to the operator. However, any citation issued solely for failing to provide evidence of financial responsibility shall be held by the issuing police officer or law enforcement agency for at least one business day before submitting the citation to the traffic tribunal. Any operator who receives a citation for failing to provide valid evidence of financial responsibility shall have the opportunity to provide evidence of financial responsibility that existed at the time of the violation within the one-business-day period, at which time the issuing police officer or law enforcement agency shall withdraw the citation, and the motorist shall not be required to appear before the traffic tribunal. Notwithstanding this provision, police officers who issue a citation for lack of evidence of financial responsibility, in addition to one or more other citations, need not wait the one-business-day waiting period before submitting the citation for lack of evidence of financial responsibility to the traffic tribunal. The traffic tribunal may, by rule and regulation, prescribe the procedures for processing the citations. Motor vehicles may not be stopped solely for the purpose of checking for evidence of proof of financial security.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Diesel emissions, due in large part to their high concentrations of particulate matter, are associated with severe and multiple health risks to the citizens of Rhode Island, including increased risks of cancer, decreased lung function, aggravated asthma, heart attacks and premature death. Reducing diesel pollution will also help advance the state’s climate protection goals and climate action plan by reducing black carbon pollution.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Diesel exhaust also contains nitrogen oxides, which contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, or smog. Rhode Island continues to be classified as a “serious-nonattainment area” for ozone.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Reducing diesel pollution may help to stem the tide of the asthma epidemic in Rhode Island where more than one in ten (10) citizens have asthma. Rhode Island ranks eighth (8th) in the U.S. for the worst asthma rates overall, and has the fifth (5th) highest rate for children. Rhode Islanders pay about forty-one million dollars ($41,000,000) per year in asthma-associated health costs. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and responsible for the most school absences in Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The EPA, recognizing the harmful effects of diesel emissions, issued new fuel and engine emission standards that will reduce particulate matter emissions from engines model year 2007 and newer ninety percent (90%) below previous levels.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The same technology that reduces emissions by up to ninety percent (90%) for new engines can be retrofitted onto existing engines, which will continue to operate for years.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> As a first step in tackling the diesel pollution problem in Rhode Island, school buses should be given high priority.</p>

If any action is brought by a prosecutor to punish, prevent or restrain any activity made unlawful under § 31-48-3, the running of the period of limitations shall be suspended during the pendency of the action and for two (2) years following its termination.</p>

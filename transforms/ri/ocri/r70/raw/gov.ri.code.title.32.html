<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen.

The fact that the pedestrian was injured while returning to her car after simply observing a soccer game, as opposed to participating in the soccer game, was insignificant, and the Recreational Use Statute applied.

<p class="p6"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under Rhode Island statutory law, a landowner owes no duty to a trespasser unless the trespasser is first discovered in a position of peril. Cain v. Johnson, 755 A.2d 156, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 173 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where plaintiffs contended that the state negligently caused a defect in a roadway in a state park and had a duty to warn of that defect, but they never alleged, or raised a factual question regarding, willful or malicious conduct by the state, the state was entitled to immunity from liability under the recreational use statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 32-6-3, on the issue of its alleged negligence, and § 32-6-5(a)(1) did not apply. Hanley v. State, 837 A.2d 707, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 230 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiffs’ payment of a camping fee to camp at a state park did not constitute an entrance fee that would cause application of the R.I. Gen. Laws § 32-6-5(a)(2) exclusion from immunity under § 32-6-3 where the state charged camping and parking fees per vehicle entering the park regardless of the number of occupants in said vehicles and where the state did not charge an entrance fee to recreational users who entered on foot or by bicycle. Hanley v. State, 837 A.2d 707, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 230 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Student injured after falling into a drain on the field during a soccer game was entitled to a new trial against the town with regard to the negligence suit she filed against the school district, the town, and a landscaping company, because the trial court erred by concluding that the town was a landowner under the recreational use statute since the student was not a member of the public as contemplated under the recreational use statute. Morales v. Town of Johnston, 895 A.2d 721, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 56 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Illustrative Cases.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where plaintiff was injured when he fell off a cliff, in view of evidence that the city which controlled the cliff walk where plaintiff fell knew about its latent dangers, and that, despite several serious accidents, it failed to either guard against those dangers or post warnings, the city was not entitled to have plaintiff’s negligence suit dismissed on summary judgment under R.I. Gen. Laws § 32-6-5(a) of Rhode Island’s Recreational Use Statute. Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 45 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As a city and a preservation society were not engaged in a joint enterprise with respect to a tourist attraction sufficient to satisfy the limiting language of Rhode Island’s Recreational Use Statute with respect to liability for “the willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity after discovering the user’s peril” under R.I. Gen. Laws § 32-6-5(a)(1), the actions or omissions of the city could not be imputed to the society. Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 45 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in refusing to apply the exceptions in subsection (a)(1) because there was no evidence that the town was aware of a hole, and the town did not know that the citizen was facing peril. Carlson v. Town of S. Kingstown, 111 A.3d 819, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 48 (R.I. 2015).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Exception set forth in subsection (a)(2) did not apply because there was no fee charged to the citizen to walk onto the field and observe her son playing a baseball game; despite any taxes the citizen could have paid to the town, the payment or nonpayment of those taxes did not affect whether she could use the park for recreation, and therefore, the taxes were not charges or fees to use the land. Carlson v. Town of S. Kingstown, 111 A.3d 819, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 48 (R.I. 2015).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Landowner was properly granted summary judgment in a personal injury action, as the exception in this section was inapplicable because there was no evidence that the landowner had knowledge of either the particular defect or similar injuries and thus, the landowner did not willfully disregard a known risk of injury. Symonds v. City of Pawtucket, 126 A.3d 421, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 102 (R.I. 2015).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State of Rhode Island was not liable when an accident victim was injured when diving into the pond at a memorial park because there was no evidence to support a finding that the State willfully or maliciously failed to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity after discovering a user’s peril. Furthermore, the State did not owe a duty of care to the victim because diving was an open and obvious danger. Roy v. State, 139 A.3d 480, 2016 R.I. LEXIS 88 (R.I. 2016).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>City was entitled to summary judgment on an administratrix’s claim that a pothole in a public park caused a decedent’s injuries because the administratrix did not show § 32-6-5 applied, as (1) nothing showed the city had actual knowledge of the pothole, had received complaints about the condition of the roadway, or had notice of past incidents resulting from that condition, as nothing showed the pothole was present when a city employee drove over the roadway or that the city had received any complaints or other notice about the roadway condition, (2) nothing showed the city willfully or maliciously failed to guard or warn against the pothole, and (3) it was undisputed the park was open to the public free of charge and the decedent was engaged in the recreational activity of bicycling when injured. Cancel v. City of Providence, 187 A.3d 347, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 95 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a tort action arising from injuries a bicyclist sustained in a city park, the hearing justice did not err by refusing to apply the exception in subdivision (a)(1) of this section to the bicyclist’s claim because the record was devoid of any evidence that anyone else had ever been injured by the retaining wall or that the city was notified about its defective condition. The record also lacked any indication that the city had actual knowledge of the condition, had received complaints, or had notice of any past incidents resulting from the defective condition of the retaining wall. Yattaw v. City of E. Providence, 203 A.3d 1167, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 45 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court properly granted summary judgment in favor of a city in a mother’s action on behalf of her seriously injured child because the city was immune from liability under Rhode Island’s Recreational Use Statute, the mother’s objection to the city’s motion for summary judgment centered on her contention that discovery was incomplete, and whether verbal notice about the condition of the park to a member of the city council qualified as notice to the city was questionable where the record was devoid of any evidence that anyone else was injured on the baseball field at the park or that the city was on notice of an alleged defect. Rohena v. City of Providence, 154 A.3d 935, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 29 (R.I. 2017).</p>

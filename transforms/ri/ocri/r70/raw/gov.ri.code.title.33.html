Likewise, before probate, an instrument purporting to be a last will may be annexed to a commission for taking depositions in proof of the same, in this or any other state, territory, district or foreign country; a photographic copy of the instrument, duly certified, being retained on the files of the court. From any order of the court granting permission, for annexing a will to a commission as provided above, no appeal shall lie. In case the original will is lost, on proof of loss, the copy may be proved in the same manner and shall have the same effect as the original.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The object of this section is to facilitate the settlement of the estates of deceased persons, and to make all the prescribed steps towards the distribution of the estate conclusive once they have been taken. Lind v. McSoley, 419 A.2d 247, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1724 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction With Other Statutes.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Construction of § 33-11-8, placing jurisdiction in probate court to examine and determine a claim filed by a person who only afterwards becomes administrator, is not inconsistent with the general statutory provisions of this section. KIGGIN v. KIGGIN, 59 R.I. 370, 195 A. 492, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 174 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature intended to require “persons having claims” to file a statement of those claims pursuant to this section before they may assert the status under § 33-23-1 of a “person aggrieved” by a probate court order or decree concerning a decedent’s estate. Lind v. McSoley, 419 A.2d 247, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1724 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Contents of Claim.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claimant is not required to set forth the evidence upon which he relies to justify recovery. White v. Almy, 34 R.I. 29, 82 A. 397, 1912 R.I. LEXIS 27 (1912).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not require any particular language in which claim for services must be set out, if it fairly and substantially informs executor of extent of claim, limited to amount and nature, but need not state evidence to support the claim. Lancaster v. Marshall, 69 R.I. 422, 34 A.2d 718, 1943 R.I. LEXIS 68 (1943).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice did not err in determining that the provision requiring claims filed against the estates of deceased persons to contain an affidavit was not jurisdictional in character, as the primary purpose was to require a copy of the claim to be placed in the hands of the executor or administrator simultaneously with or prior to the filing of the claim in the probate court; therefore, claim of divorced wife filed against the estate of her former husband was not defective for lack of an affidavit. Holt v. Sullivan, 95 R.I. 412, 187 A.2d 533, 1963 R.I. LEXIS 12 (1963).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Expenses of Administration.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Expenses of administration need not be filed as claims against a decedent’s estate and the limitation on filing of claims has no application to such expenses. McLeod v. Fielder, 79 R.I. 321, 88 A.2d 329, 1952 R.I. LEXIS 51 (1952); Cox v. Amend, 97 R.I. 382, 198 A.2d 48, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 95 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Funeral Expenses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The expenses of the funeral of a deceased person contracted for by the estate, either directly or indirectly, are not claims against a deceased person within the meaning of this section. Cox v. Amend, 97 R.I. 382, 198 A.2d 48, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 95 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Payments Under Divorce Decree.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claim by administratrix, who was divorced from bed and board of deceased, for back alimony and support was properly filed with the clerk of the probate court. Gilbert v. Hayward, 37 R.I. 303, 92 A. 625, 1914 R.I. LEXIS 47 (1914).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where provisions for payments to decedent’s former wife, in agreement to establish a trust, were also incorporated in final divorce decree, claim by former wife against decedent’s estate pursuant to such provisions could be adjudicated only in the superior court. Mulry v. Industrial Nat'l Bank, 104 R.I. 597, 247 A.2d 847, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 690 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Persons Entitled to File.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ward who was under guardianship for lack of discretion in managing his estate could file a claim in an estate of a deceased person. Taylor v. Superior Court, 30 R.I. 560, 76 A. 644, 1910 R.I. LEXIS 57 (1910).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A claimant has no potential interest in an estate until he complies with the filing requirements of this chapter. Lind v. McSoley, 419 A.2d 247, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1724 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claimants who fail to file a statement of claim as required by this chapter lack standing to challenge a final account of a decedent’s estate in the probate court. Lind v. McSoley, 419 A.2d 247, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1724 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Creditor of Beneficiary’s Estate.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A judgment creditor of the estate of decedent’s beneficiary has the identical interest in decedent’s estate as the interest asserted by a judgment creditor who commences an action to reach and apply his judgment debtor’s interest in a decedent’s estate. Lind v. McSoley, 419 A.2d 247, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1724 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A judgment creditor of the estate of decedent’s beneficiary has no standing to appeal the closing of decedent’s estate without payment of a legacy to the beneficiary’s estate unless the creditor files a claim directly against decedent’s estate. Lind v. McSoley, 419 A.2d 247, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1724 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Place of Filing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Declaration that plaintiff presented his claim thereon to the administrator was demurrable, since plaintiff was required to file claim in the office of the clerk of probate court, but since administrator did not demur or object to evidence showing filing of claim with the clerk he could not raise question of variance on an appeal. Roberts v. White, 32 R.I. 185, 78 A. 497, 1911 R.I. LEXIS 1 (1911).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Suit on Bond.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In order for creditor to recover in suit on bond to pay debts and legacies he must show that he has filed a claim with the clerk of the probate court within the statutory period.

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although this section discriminates between the rights accorded the creditor and those afforded to the decedent’s estate, the purpose of this section is to give a claimant the opportunity, in the discretion of the Probate Court, to file his claim beyond the six-month period, which is a sufficient rational basis for distinguishing between the rights accorded to a creditor and the estate; hence the section does not violate the equal protection clause of the constitution. Estate of McAlpine v. Estate of McAlpine, 120 R.I. 135, 386 A.2d 179, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 649 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Despite mortgagee’s failure to file a claim in the probate proceedings, the foreclosure was not time-barred as the 20-year statute of limitations applicable to foreclosures, § 9-1-17,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>applied and the limitations period associated with the probate claim-filing statute, § 33-11-5, did not apply. Summers v. Fin. Freedom Acquisition LLC, 807 F.3d 351, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 18507 (1st Cir. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Auto Insurance Policy.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The potential right of a decedent who has been involved in an automobile collision to exoneration or indemnity under her automobile liability insurance policy is an asset of the decedent’s estate and, until it has been listed in the inventory and disposed of, the assets of the estate have not been completely distributed and the estate has not been fully administered. Smith v. Estate of Catterall, 107 R.I. 729, 271 A.2d 300, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 835 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Claim for Corporate Debt.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Administrator of an estate could not be summoned to defend suit against deceased as a stockholder in a corporation against which plaintiff had a judgment, where no claim had been filed in the estate. Andrews v. O'Reilly, 34 R.I. 256, 83 A. 119, 1912 R.I. LEXIS 48 (1912).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Claim on Bond.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In suit by plaintiff to recover on bond of deceased, plea of estate that suit was barred due to failure to file claim within statutory period was good against demurrer, since plaintiff was a “creditor” of the estate. Municipal Court v. Whaley, 26 R.I. 25, 57 A. 1061, 1904 R.I. LEXIS 12 (1904).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Claims Filed Out of Time.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court did not err in finding that a challenge to the denial of a probate claim was not timely filed since the claimant took no further action after the denial of his claim until more than five months after the statute of limitations had run. Heflin v. Koszela, 774 A.2d 25, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 158 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Amendment of Claim.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Creditor was not allowed to amend a claim after time for presenting claims had expired, even though original claim was mistakenly based on company account rather than on decedent’s personal account. Vennerbeck &amp; Clase Co. v. Markham's Estate, 54 R.I. 366, 173 A. 549, 1934 R.I. LEXIS 105 (1934).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Discretion of Court.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The determination of the validity of the reason for late filing of a claim against an estate is left in the first instance in the trial court unless petitioner’s testimony is inherently improbable or utterly unworthy of belief, and the reasons are not limited to “accident, mistake or unforeseen cause.” Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Co. v. Simons, 60 R.I. 108, 197 A. 190, 1938 R.I. LEXIS 105 (1938) (decided prior to 1941 and 1952 amendments).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section will be liberally construed, thus giving the probate court a wide discretion in determining possible relief to be granted under its discretionary power to allow late filings. Dunlop v. McLaughlin, 62 R.I. 417, 6 A.2d 446, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 37 (1939) (decided prior to 1941 and 1952 amendments).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Probate Court is given a wide, although not unlimited, discretion in the matter of filing claims against estate which are out of time, and unless the Probate Court has abused that discretion, its decision will not be reversed and its judgment on the facts after a fair hearing will stand as conclusive, unless such judgment is so lacking in evidence to support it, that there is no valid reason for the exercise of the court’s discretion. Estate of McAlpine v. Estate of McAlpine, 120 R.I. 135, 386 A.2d 179, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 649 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Division of Single Claim.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claimant who filed only a portion of his claim against estate within six-month period, was not entitled to file the part omitted as a new claim within the twelve-month period, hence the administrator was not required to disallow the second claim and was not guilty of unfaithful administration for failure to pay the second claim. Potter v. Harvey, 34 R.I. 71, 82 A. 812, 1912 R.I. LEXIS 37 (1912).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Filing After Distribution.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claim could not be filed after distribution of the estate even though the reason for failure to file was accident, mistake or unforeseen cause and even though the distribution had not been approved by the court. Slaimen v. Curtis, 56 R.I. 351, 185 A. 684, 1936 R.I. LEXIS 108 (1936).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A creditor was not entitled to file a claim out of time where the final account disclosed that all debts were paid, and the remaining balance in the estate had been paid to the heirs, even though the payment to the heirs had been made without a court order. Chatigny v. Gancz, 84 R.I. 255, 123 A.2d 140, 1956 R.I. LEXIS 53 (1956).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Probate court erred in granting a claimant’s petition for leave to file a claim out of time against an estate because the probate court was without jurisdiction to entertain the petition as it was presented for filing after the final distribution had been paid or delivered to the estate’s beneficiaries, although the distribution was made without a prior order of the probate court. The fact that the executor of the estate did not secure a release regarding another claim against the estate before distributing the assets did not alter the analysis. In re Estate of Buonanno, 909 A.2d 494, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 163 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Reasons for Late Filing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Excuse for failure to file claim held valid in trial court’s discretion was held sufficient in supreme court where claimant had been writing a book and therefore had not given further attention to the delinquent claim. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Co. v. Simons, 60 R.I. 108, 197 A. 190, 1938 R.I. LEXIS 105 (1938) (decided prior to 1941 and 1952 amendments).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Claims against the estate not filed within one year from first publication of notice to creditors are barred, except that a creditor who has failed to claim because of accident, mistake or unforeseen cause may file his claim before distribution. Kimball v. Kelly, 65 R.I. 484, 16 A.2d 491, 1940 R.I. LEXIS 145 (1940) (decided prior to 1941 amendment).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Forgetfulness of the attorney for the claimant is not a valid reason for the exercise of discretion by the probate court to grant leave to file a claim which is untimely. Jablonski v. Andrusckiewicz, 70 R.I. 128, 37 A.2d 468, 1944 R.I. LEXIS 21 (1944).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As the six-month limitation period for filing claims against a decedent’s estate was not triggered until the Department of Human Services received notice that the estate had been opened, and as it filed its claim only two months after receiving notice—well within the six-month window—its claim was not time-barred. In re Estate of Manchester, 66 A.3d 426, 2013 R.I. LEXIS 84 (R.I. 2013).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Review of Probate Court.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Decision denying leave to file late claim under the discretionary power of court is reviewable on appeal to superior court and will not be reviewed on certiorari in the supreme court. MacKenzie &amp; Shea v. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Co., 45 R.I. 407, 122 A. 774, 1923 R.I. LEXIS 85 (1923) (decided prior to 1952 amendment).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unless the trial court has abused its wide discretion under this section to allow late filing of claims against an estate or has based its decision upon mistake as to its powers or upon an error of law, the supreme court will not reverse the decision.

<p class="p7"><b>Purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statutory provisions for settlement of estates are specific and designed to effect a prompt settlement. National Casket Co. v. Montgomery, 52 R.I. 158, 158 A. 723, 1932 R.I. LEXIS 16 (1932).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This statute of limitations was created for security and benefit of estates and not for executors and administrators as such. Gray v. Ahern, 63 R.I. 363, 9 A.2d 38, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 108 (1939).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Amendment of Pleadings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Suit against executor as an individual could not be amended so as to be a suit against the estate by amendment filed more than one year after disallowance of the claim by the executor. Carney v. Hawkins, 34 R.I. 297, 83 A. 327, 1912 R.I. LEXIS 51 (1912).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where claim was properly filed and action was duly commenced, the complaint could be amended, if no change in the cause of action originally commenced was effected. Lewis Historical Pub. Co. v. Greene, 40 R.I. 309, 100 A. 1017, 1917 R.I. LEXIS 37 (1917).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Compliance Required.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is jurisdictional. Gray v. Ahern, 63 R.I. 363, 9 A.2d 38, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 108 (1939).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court did not err in finding that a challenge to the denial of a probate claim was not timely filed since the claimant took no further action after the denial of his claim until more than five months after the statute of limitations had run. Heflin v. Koszela, 774 A.2d 25, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 158 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Disallowance of Claim.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Allegation that executor failed to file statement in probate court either allowing or denying claim as required by former statute was proper, even if not necessary, as the presumption would be that he had acted as the law required and had duly rejected such claim. Slocom v. Wilbour, 23 R.I. 97, 49 A. 489, 1901 R.I. LEXIS 95 (1901).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff ’s suit on disallowed claim complied with time limit where brought within six months after opinion of supreme court sustaining a decision of probate court allowing executor’s petition to disallow out of time, even though brought over six months from notice of disallowance. Davis v. Higgins, 63 R.I. 352, 8 A.2d 870, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 98 (1939).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Entry After Return Day.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where claimant failed to file writ against the administrator, allegedly because of the failure of claimant’s attorney to file and belief that he had a sufficient remedy in the probate court, superior court could refuse to enter papers as of that date. National Casket Co. v. Montgomery, 52 R.I. 158, 158 A. 723, 1932 R.I. LEXIS 16 (1932).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Filing of Claim.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiffs could not recover on suit based on personal injuries where a statement of the claim had not been filed nor disallowed within the time limit under § 33-11-5. Kelley v. Harlow, 51 R.I. 137, 152 A. 696, 1930 R.I. LEXIS 69 (1930).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Bringing suit on disallowed claim in strict compliance with this section after executrix had appealed from probate decree granting leave to file such claim out of time, was a purely procedural step not requiring immediate determination by the court. McLaughlin v. Dunlop, 68 R.I. 4, 26 A.2d 3, 1942 R.I. LEXIS 25 (1942).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although recovery for a tortious injury allegedly committed by a person who later dies may be uncertain, at the time of the person’s death the claim already has accrued and is not dependent upon some future event, and thus a person filing a negligence claim, like every other creditor, is required to file his probate court claim pursuant to § 33-11-5 and any subsequent action challenging the denial of that probate claim pursuant to § 33-11-48. Heflin v. Koszela, 774 A.2d 25, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 158 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Foreign Executor.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where claim was filed by executor from another state and after claim was disallowed suit was brought thereon, and thereafter such foreign executor obtained ancillary letters in Rhode Island at which time the time for filing claims had expired, suit could not be maintained thereon. Fitch v. Firestone, 184 F. Supp. 424, 1960 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2855 (D.R.I. 1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Parties to Actions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An administrator whose claim against the estate has been rejected by the commissioners cannot bring an action against himself and plead by way of justification that if he had waited for another administrator to be appointed the time limits prescribed by this section would have been exceeded. Perkins v. Se Ipsam, 11 R.I. 270, 1875 R.I. LEXIS 38 (1875).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Devisees and residuary legatees could not maintain writ of error from judgment in favor of claimant consented to by executor on the ground that they had objected to allowance of claim, since there is no provision permitting them to be parties to a suit against the estate. Carney v. Superior Court, 30 R.I. 276, 74 A. 1018, 1910 R.I. LEXIS 13 (1910).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section and the general statute of limitations, § 9-1-21, do not apply to actions that are pending prior to the death of a party. Hopp v. C.H.B. Dev. Corp., 669 A.2d 1152, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 4 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Voluntary Discontinuance.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff ’s action against executor on disallowed claim against estate was barred when brought over six months from disallowance, where prior action on same cause brought within the six months had been voluntarily discontinued. Gray v. Ahern, 63 R.I. 363, 9 A.2d 38, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 108 (1939).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Approval Required.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The clear and unambiguous language of this section provides that the representative of an estate can sell the real estate of a decedent despite the sufficiency of personal property to pay debts only upon approval of the court for such a sale, and only after obtaining the written consent of specific devisees. Hanley v. Alarie, 746 A.2d 125, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 41 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>General or Specific Devise.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a bankruptcy debtor’s mother generally devised certain real property to the debtor, in common with the debtor’s sister, in the residuary clause of the mother’s will, the debtor had no standing to occupy or intend to occupy the property, after the sister, acting as executrix of the mother’s estate, began proceedings to evict the debtor from the property, because (1) the sister did not require the consent of the debtor or of the court to sell the property, as R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-12-6 did not require the debtor’s consent for generally devised property, and the will gave the sister the authority to sell the property, and (2) the sister took affirmative steps to sell the property before the debtor filed for bankruptcy protection, divesting the debtor of the debtor’s possessory interest in the property.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In doubtful cases presumption is that residuary legacies are general rather than specific, and plaintiff failed to prove the contrary where will, while clearly expressing testatrix’s intent that her sons should receive all property owned by her at time of her death, described no particular real estate.

<p class="p7"><b>Homestead Exemption.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a bankruptcy debtor’s mother generally devised certain real property to the debtor, in common with the debtor’s sister, in the residuary clause of the mother’s will, the debtor could claim a homestead exemption as to the debtor’s interest in the property because (1) the debtor was immediately vested with a fee simple interest, subject to defeasance, upon the debtor’s mother’s death, and (2) any need to sell the property, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-12-6, did not keep title from vesting. In re Tetreault, 11 A.3d 635, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 4 (R.I. 2011).</p>

<p class="p6">The legislature finds that adjudicating a person totally incapacitated and in need of a guardian deprives that person of all his or her civil and legal rights and that this deprivation may be unnecessary. The legislature further finds that it is desirable to make available, the least restrictive form of guardianship to assist persons who are only partially incapable of caring for their needs. Recognizing that every individual has unique needs and differing abilities, the legislature declares that it is the purpose of this act to promote the public welfare by establishing a system that permits incapacitated persons to participate as fully as possible in all decisions affecting them; that assists such persons in meeting the essential requirements for their physical health and safety, in protecting their rights, in managing their financial resources, and developing or regaining their abilities to the maximum extent possible; and that accomplishes these objectives through providing, in each case, the form of assistance that least interferes with the legal capacity of a person to act in his or her own behalf. This chapter shall be liberally construed to accomplish this purpose.</p>

One such decision making assessment tool must be completed by the respondent’s primary care physician, if one exists and is available, otherwise by a physician who has examined and treated the respondent. The probate court may consider such additional decision making assessments tools signed and submitted by one or more non-physicians or consulting physicians.

The court shall authorize the guardian to make decisions for the individual in only those areas where the court finds, based on one or more decision making assessment tools, that the individual lacks the capacity to make decisions. The court must strike a delicate balance between providing the protection and support necessary to assist the individual and preserving, to the largest degree possible, the liberty, property and privacy interests of the individual. The certificate of appointment issued to the limited guardian shall clearly state that it is a limited guardianship. The court order shall clearly indicate the scope of the powers and duties of the limited guardian. The appointment of a limited guardian shall not constitute a finding of legal incompetence.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court properly dismissed the probate appeal of the 93-year-old ward as the ward was under a full guardianship and thus lacked the capacity to retain independent counsel to pursue the probate appeal on his own behalf. Although the petition filed by the ward’s children was titled “petition for limited guardianship”, the certificate of appointment did not comply with this section because it did not clearly state that the guardian was appointed as limited guardian and it qualified the guardian as guardian of both the person and estate of the ward. Further, the December 15, 2015 order was defective because it did not clearly indicate the scope of the powers and duties of the limited guardian, and the December 18, 2015 order superseded the December 15, 2015 order.

<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> For the purposes of this section, “conviction” means, in addition to judgments of conviction entered by a court subsequent to a finding of guilty or a plea of guilty, those instances where the defendant has entered a plea of nolo contendere and has received a sentence of probation and those instances where a defendant has entered into a deferred sentence agreement.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> If any disqualifying information is discovered with respect to the applicant, the bureau of criminal identification of the attorney general, state police, or the local police department will inform the probate court, in writing, without disclosing the nature of the disqualifying information, that an item of disqualifying nature has been discovered.

An applicant against whom disqualifying information has been found may request that a copy of the criminal background report be sent to the probate court which shall make the determination of suitability of the applicant.</p>

In ascertaining and carrying out the ward’s wishes, or in determining which actions are in the ward’s best interests, the court may consider, but shall not be limited to minimization of current or prospective state or federal income, estate and inheritance taxes, and providing for gifts to charities, relatives and friends as would be likely recipients of donations or future inheritances from the ward.</p>

The proposed action or application of funds may include gifts of the ward’s personal property or real estate. Gifts may be for the benefit of prospective legatees, devisees or heirs apparent of the ward, or may be made to individuals or charities in which the ward is believed to have an interest. The conservator, limited guardian or guardian shall also indicate in the petition that any planned disposition is consistent with the intentions of the ward insofar as they can be ascertained, or are otherwise in the best interest of the ward. If the ward’s intentions cannot be ascertained, the ward will be presumed to favor reduction in the incidence of the various forms of taxation, and the partial distribution of the ward’s estate during his or her lifetime, as provided in this section.

To the extent that any such minor child has property or an estate of his or her own, or that there is income or principal of any trust for his or her benefit, which may be used to provide the child with an education in a college, university or private school, the natural guardians shall not be obligated either jointly or separately to provide an education. The foregoing sentence shall not be deemed to create by implication any obligation to provide an education where none would otherwise exist. The natural guardians shall have equal powers and rights and neither shall have any right paramount to the right of the other concerning the custody of the minor children, and both shall be entitled to their services, and to their earnings, the payment of which to either parent shall be a valid and sufficient discharge to the employer of the children until after notice in writing has been given to him or her by both or either of the parents of their intention to both claim the earnings. Provided, however, this section and § 33-15.1-3 shall not affect the right of a probate court duly to appoint a legal guardian of the person and estate, or of the person or estate of any minor children, or the right of any court in the state, in any suit or proceedings duly brought or heard in the court, to make any order, decree, decision or judgment regarding the care, custody, education, estate or otherwise of any minor children, in which event the appointment of the probate court and the order, decree, decision or judgment of any other court shall supersede the natural guardianship insofar as the same shall be inconsistent with the appointment, order, decree, decision or judgment.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-18-17 permits an interested beneficiary to sue “in the name of” an estate, it does not convert such a suit into a suit by the estate. Haffenreffer v. Coleman, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75432 (D.R.I. Oct. 10, 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Applicability</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Motion to disqualify a law firm representing one brother in a state court action brought under R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-18-17 was denied because another brother—who was a co-executor with the first brother—failed to establish that the firm’s representation of the first brother as an interested beneficiary created any attorney-client relationship between the firm and the estate of the brothers’ mother or that the firm’s representation of the first brother in the state court action materially limited its representation of defendant option holders in a case brought by the second brother before the federal court. Haffenreffer v. Coleman, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75432 (D.R.I. Oct. 10, 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-18-17, although other co-executor’s did not authorize a lawsuit, the third co-executor—although barred from suing in that capacity— had standing in his capacity as a principal beneficiary of the estate to bring a state court action for what he perceived to be “the benefit of the estate” and his interest in it. Haffenreffer v. Coleman, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75432 (D.R.I. Oct. 10, 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Counsel.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Co-executor of a decedent’s estate was permitted to engage her own counsel at her own expense because it was essential that the co-executor have the selection of an attorney who was to assist her in the performance of duties imposed on her by law; R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 33-14-12, 33-18-2, and 33-18-17 did not preclude the co-executor from retaining her own counsel. In re Estate of Dermanouelian, 51 A.3d 327, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 103 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Evidence Insufficient.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plaintiff had failed to allege sufficient facts which, if proved, would support the action of the case in the nature of a conspiracy against the probate judge and the administrator of the estate of one sister who was also the guardian of the estate of the other sister, said plaintiffs being the heirs at law of the second sister, they claiming to have been entitled to inherit the entire estate of second sister, there not being sufficient allegations of facts from which an intent to conspire could reasonably be inferred. Stubbs v. Taft, 88 R.I. 462, 149 A.2d 706, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 29 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Exhaustion of Remedies.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where grandchildren alleged tortious interference with their expectancy of inheritance and undue influence regarding an inter vivos property conveyance by their grandmother, their claims failed to survive summary judgment because they did not exhaust their statutory remedies; Rhode Island’s statutory procedure would have provided an adequate remedy.

<p class="p7"><b>Standing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Niece lacked standing under R.I. Gen.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> A person, excluding another state, claiming an interest in any property paid or delivered to the administrator may file with him or her a claim on a form prescribed by him or her and verified by the claimant.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The administrator shall consider each claim within ninety (90) days after it is filed and give written notice to the claimant if the claim is denied in whole or in part. The notice may be given by mailing it to the last address, if any, stated in the claim as the address to which notices are to be sent. If no address for notices is stated in the claim, the notice may be mailed to the last address, if any, of the claimant as stated in the claim. No notice of denial need be given if the claim fails to state either the last address to which notices are to be sent or the address of the claimant.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> If a claim is allowed, the administrator shall pay over or deliver to the claimant the property or the amount the administrator actually received, or the net proceeds if it has been sold by the administrator, together with any additional amount required by § 33-21.1-21. If the claim is for property presumed abandoned under § 33-21.1-10 which was sold by the administrator within three (3) years after the date of delivery, the amount payable for that claim is the value of the property at the time the claim was made or the net proceeds of sale, whichever is greater. If the property claimed was interest bearing to the owner on the date of surrender by the holder, the administrator also shall pay interest at a rate of five percent (5%) a year or any lesser rate the property earned while in the possession of the holder. Interest begins to accrue when the property is delivered to the administrator and ceases on the earlier of the expiration of fifteen (15) years after delivery or the date on which payment is made to the owner. No interest on interest bearing property is payable for any period before the effective date of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Any holder who pays the owner for property that has been delivered to the state and which, if claimed from the administrator, would be subject to subsection (c) shall add interest as provided in subsection (c).

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Any person aggrieved by an order or decree of a probate court (hereinafter “appellant”), may, unless provisions be made to the contrary, appeal to the superior court for the county in which the probate court is established by taking the following procedure:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Within twenty (20) days after execution of the order or decree by the probate judge, the appellant shall file, in the office of the clerk of the probate court, a claim of appeal to the superior court and a request for a certified copy of the claim and shall pay the clerk his or her fees therefor.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Within thirty (30) days after the entry of the order or decree, the appellant shall file, in the superior court, a certified copy of the claim and the reasons of appeal specifically stated, to which reasons the appellant shall be restricted, unless, for cause shown, and with or without terms, the superior court shall allow amendments and additions thereto.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The appellant shall file with the probate clerk an affidavit in proof of the filing and docketing of the probate appeal pursuant to the time deadlines set forth in subdivision (a)(2).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> An appeal under this chapter is not an appeal on error but is to be heard de novo in the superior court. The record of proceedings, including the certified documents and the transcript (if any) from the probate proceedings, may be introduced in the superior court without further authentication. The findings of fact and/or decisions of the probate court may be given as much weight and deference as the superior court deems appropriate, however, the superior court shall not be bound by any such findings or decisions. Nothing herein shall preclude a witness who testified at the probate court proceeding from testifying at the superior court hearing, however, the transcript of such probate court testimony may be used for any evidentiary purpose, consistent with the Rhode Island rules of evidence.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The deadline of subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) are jurisdictional and may not be extended by either the probate court or the superior court.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Nothing in this chapter shall preclude interested parties in a probate proceeding from stipulating to a probate appeal from the probate court to the superior court and, toward that end, to build a record by agreed statement of facts and otherwise; to fashion on a form of order or decree to preserve or frame issues as the parties desire; and to preserve the status quo ante pending appeal through custodianship of assets or otherwise. Such a stipulated probate appeal shall be governed by, and be subject to, the procedural requirements of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The executor, administrator, guardian, or other fiduciary, pending a probate appeal, shall annually, or more often as requested by the probate court, file a written report of the status of the appeal.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The filing fees payable to the superior court clerk for reasons of appeal in a probate appeal shall be the same as those established from time to time for the filing of a complaint in a civil action.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Appeal Bond.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The intent of the provisions requiring an appellant to give bond to cover costs is that the prevailing party, whether appellant or appellee, can recover the costs. Wheeler v. Wheeler, 2 R.I. 1, 1851 R.I. LEXIS 15 (1851).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Appeal Properly Dismissed.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Tenant’s appeal of a probate court’s judgment to a superior court was properly dismissed because the tenant did not make a good faith effort to comply with R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-23-1, as (1) the tenant failed to submit any records from the probate court proceedings, (2) the tenant fatally neglected to file a claim of appeal with the probate court, which was an all-important condition precedent for the taking of an effective appeal, and (3) the superior court did not have the discretion to overlook the tenant’s failure to comply with the jurisdictional requirements of R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-23-1. Ims v. Audette, 40 A.3d 236, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 32 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Tenant’s appeal of a probate court’s judgment to a superior court was properly dismissed because (1) the tenant did not pay the requisite filing fees, (2) the tenant did not substantiate the tenant’s untimely claim that the tenant lacked the means to pay the fees, and (3) the tenant’s claim that the tenant could not afford the fees did not excuse the tenant’s failure to file a claim of appeal in the probate court, and the tenant’s consequent failure to satisfy R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-23-1(a). Ims v. Audette, 40 A.3d 236, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 32 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court properly dismissed a pro se executrix’s appeal from a probate court order because (1) the executrix’s claims about the probate judge’s attitude were irrelevant in a de novo appeal, and (2) the executrix otherwise raised no cognizable legal issue.

<p class="p7"><b>Authority of Court.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An estate’s proper remedy where an appeal was not timely filed was to file a petition pursuant to § 9-21-6, since the probate court lacked the authority to “level the playing field” by extending the time in which the estate could bring its appeal.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Appeal of a decision by a probate court to diminish a co-administrator’s decision-making authority mandated a de novo hearing where the decision was based on deference to the probate court’s findings and the probate court record was devoid of any factual findings.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a trial court properly dismissed a probate appeal by two of a decedent’s heirs because their signatures were not on the claim of appeal, the trial court erred in dismissing the probate appeal by a third heir because the third heir was the only party that satisfied R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-23-1(a)(1), and the consent order, in which the parties stipulated to the appeal and framed the issues that were to form the basis of the appeal to the trial court, was sufficient to provide notice and to confine the appeal to those enumerated issues; the consent order was referred within and attached to the claim of appeal when it was filed in the probate court, and was filed within the thirty-day time limitation of § 33-23-1(a)(2). Mendes v. Factor, 41 A.3d 994, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 51 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Matters Not Included in Reasons.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whether a certain heir should have been appointed administrator was not a part of the proceedings where such heir was not present in the probate court either in person or by counsel, the record did not show that any request was made to the probate court to appoint her and no mention was made of such heir in the reasons of appeal. Whitmarsh v. O'Reilly, 86 R.I. 361, 134 A.2d 469, 1957 R.I. LEXIS 110 (1957).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in dismissing appeals from a probate court order because appellants did not merely fail to produce a transcript of the probate court proceedings, but they failed to produce anything beyond that court’s decision and their own reasons for appeal; the trial court correctly held that R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-23-1(c) applied only to transcripts and that it did not have the authority to extend the deadline to file the record. In re Estate of Griggs, 63 A.3d 867, 2013 R.I.

Spooner v. Tucker, 86 R.I. 266, 134 A.2d 403, 1957 R.I. LEXIS 106 (1957).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under this statute an appellant, if his interest does not appear in the record, must set out in his reasons of appeal the facts and circumstances upon which he bases his claim to be entitled to appeal as a person “aggrieved.” Such allegations will be sufficient however, if they show an interest in the subject matter of the controversy and that the decree has adversely affected some personal or property right or imposes upon him some burden or obligation.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Apportionment of attorneys’ fees and expenses of administration between a life tenant and a remainderman was error because the life estate was taken subject only to any encumbrance or secured lien on the property that existed at time of the decedent’s death, and the apportioned costs were not encumbrances or liens; these expenses, including legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses, were separate and apart from the closing costs associated with the sale of the real estate at issue, which properly were allocated. The fees and expenses incurred during the administration of the probate estate did not exist at the time of the decedent’s death and should have been paid from the remainder interest. Jerome v.

<p class="p7"><b>Illusory Transfer Test.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The illusory transfer test is the proper test to be used when determining whether a now-deceased spouse’s inter vivos transfer of real property is sufficient to defeat a surviving spouse’s statutory share pursuant to this section. Pezza v. Pezza, 690 A.2d 345, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 72 (R.I. 1997) (decided prior to 1999 amendment).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-25-2(b) and the illusory transfer test are incompatible; the illusory transfer test was adopted in the absence of any legislative determination respecting inter vivos trusts of real property or whether a transfer to a trust is sufficient to defeat a surviving spouse’s right to a life estate, and by its enactment of R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-25-2(b), the General Assembly has spoken in the clearest of terms, and has declared that the only predicate to defeating a surviving spouse’s right to a life estate is a conveyance of the real estate that is recorded prior to death. Barrett v. Barrett, 894 A.2d 891, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 37 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly granted summary judgment to the trustees of a trust in an action by the wife of a decedent for a declaration of her rights to property, as pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-25-2(b), the husband’s transfer of the property to the trust extinguished the wife’s right under R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-25-4 to a life estate over the property. Barrett v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice misconstrued the claim-of-right doctrine when the justice ruled that the adverse claimants and their predecessors failed to satisfy the elements of adverse possession; furthermore, the trial court should not have weighed the record-title holder’s out-of-state residence as a factor in deciding that the claimants failed to meet the strict standard of proof required in adverse possession cases. Finally, the trial justice erred in determining that a predecessor of the claimants had engaged in inequitable conduct by attempting to bootstrap himself into owning the property after the predecessor discovered that the predecessor did not hold record title.

<p class="p7"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The recording statute was inapplicable where a developer could not convey any interest in property to which it no longer had title due to the fact that its ownership interest had been extinguished a year earlier. St. Jean Place Condo. Ass'n v. DeLeo, 745 A.2d 738, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 23 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Agency.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A lease for longer than one year signed by the plaintiff’s son “acting on behalf of” the plaintiff was not valid in the absence of evidence that he was ever authorized in writing to sign such lease; moreover, subsequent ratification did not bind plaintiff. Bourne v. Campbell, 21 R.I. 490, 44 A. 806, 1899 R.I. LEXIS 113 (1899).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Bankruptcy.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure to record a mortgage does not, in the absence of other circumstances, show fraud between bankrupt and mortgagee, hence mortgage is valid as between the mortgagee and the bankrupt and can be validly assigned by the mortgagee. In re Anderson, 252 F. 272, 1918 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 939 (D.R.I. 1918).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Breach of Trust.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute of frauds did not apply to prevent the enforcement of an oral promise to reconvey real property where the parties had agreed that plaintiff would convey her property to defendant and that defendant would maintain plaintiff as long as she lived and defendant breached such agreement. Del Greco v. Del Greco, 87 R.I. 435, 142 A.2d 714, 1958 R.I. LEXIS 77 (1958).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Conveyances Required to Be in Writing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Assignment of Mortgage.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Purchaser was entitled to have assignment of a mortgage removed as a cloud on title where record at the time of the purchase showed a release by mortgagee, and assignment of mortgage was recorded after deed of purchase was recorded. Winnerman v. Angell, 26 R.I. 278, 58 A. 882, 1904 R.I. LEXIS 69 (1904).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Easements.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The word “tenements” includes incorporate rights, so that the grant of a perpetual easement cannot be enforced unless the grant complies with the requirements of this section. Foster v. Browning, 4 R.I. 47, 1856 R.I. LEXIS 10 (1856).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Leases.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unacknowledged lease to run so long as a certain building stood was ineffective, as against a subsequent bona fide purchaser, except to create a tenancy from year to year. Thurber v. Dwyer, 10 R.I. 355, 1872 R.I. LEXIS 36 (1872).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Mortgages.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An attachment on real estate made without notice of an unrecorded mortgage thereon would take precedence. McDuff Estate v. Kost, 52 R.I. 136, 158 A. 373, 1932 R.I. LEXIS 8 (1932).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a case alleging an invalid foreclosure in which the defendants moved to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), by and through their conduct, the plaintiffs had validated the mortgage. As such, they failed to allege sufficient facts that the mortgage was not properly executed on which relief can be granted and therefore their first argument under count I for interim relief was rejected. Lister v. Bank of Am., N.A., 8 F. Supp. 3d 74, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42609 (D.R.I. 2014), aff'd on other grounds, 790 F.3d 20, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 9869 (1st Cir. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Restrictive Covenants.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Vendor’s agreement to restrict the use of adjoining land was not binding where it was not included in the deed to the vendee or in any other writing. Ham v. Massasoit Real Estate Co., 42 R.I. 293, 107 A. 205, 1919 R.I. LEXIS 39 (1919).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Sale of Timber.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A sale of standing timber with license to the purchaser to remove the same within a specified time is an executory contract for the sale of chattels which is revocable by a later conveyance of the land to a third person, so that the license to remove the timber is void as to such third person. Fish v. Capwell, 18 R.I. 667, 29 A. 840, 1894 R.I. LEXIS 49 (1894).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Duty of Recorder.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a deed is executed in accordance with the statute, the recorder must record the instrument without adding extraneous words which in any way tend to affect its validity. Redelsperger v. Redelsperger, 71 R.I. 203, 43 A.2d 305, 1945 R.I. LEXIS 39 (1945).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Notarization.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action seeking to determine the proper disposition of insurance proceeds, even if a mortgage lacked proper notarization, it would not have been rendered void, pursuant to the terms of this section. Even if a mortgage was not properly notarized, it still constituted a valid agreement between a borrower and a lender. R.I. Joint Reinsurance Ass'n v. Santana-Sosa, 92 A.3d 192, 2014 R.I. LEXIS 86 (R.I. 2014).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Notice to Subsequent Purchaser.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mortgagee could obtain reformation of the mortgage to attach the necessary seals, even though the property had been attached previously, where the attaching creditor had actual notice of the mortgage. Bullock v. Whipp, 15 R.I. 195, 2 A. 309, 1885 R.I. LEXIS 23 (1885).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Judgment creditor of grantee in unrecorded deed could subject the property to payment of his debt, even though there was a later recorded deed to another, where the circumstances indicated that the grantee in the later deed may have had knowledge of the earlier deed and where the consideration given by the grantee in the later deed was doubtful. Sundlun v. Volpe, 63 R.I. 441, 9 A.2d 41, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 109 (1939).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Advertising the foreclosure sale did not provide notice, constructive or otherwise, under Rhode Island law to a subsequent bona fide purchaser. In re Burns, 183 B.R. 670, 1995 Bankr. LEXIS 917 (Bankr. D.R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the deed in question was neither acknowledged nor recorded until two years after the purported transaction, the deed was insufficient to prevent a good faith purchaser from acquiring superior title before that time. United States v. Lombardi, 924 F. Supp. 361, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6706 (D.R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a recording error existed with respect to a public utility company easement, a property owner was not a bona fide purchaser for value without notice under R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-11-1 because the owner made judicial admissions that he had actual notice of the easement; the owner requested permission from the company to construct a car wash partially on the easement prior to his purchase of the property. Grady v. Narragansett Elec. Co., 962 A.2d 34, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 7 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Assignment of Lease.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Reference in recorded assignment of lease put purchaser on notice that there was an unrecorded lease, so that he should have inquired as to the terms of the lease, particularly where lessee was in open possession of the property. Durepo v. May, 73 R.I. 71, 54 A.2d 15, 1947 R.I. LEXIS 64 (1947).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— One Signature.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A mortgage document duly recorded in the appropriate land evidence records gives constructive notice of a significant interest in the property to a bona fide purchaser five years later, despite the failure of one of the two joint mortgagors to execute a mortgage document. In re Barnacle, 623 A.2d 445, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 115 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Probate Records.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The record of a will devising specific property does not give notice to a subsequent purchaser that there is an unrecorded deed to the testator. Harris v. Arnold, 1 R.I. 125, 1848 R.I. LEXIS 4 (1848).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Signatures.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unacknowledged deeds that had printed names on signature lines were not invalidated under R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-11-1 because cursive signatures were not required and the grantor had admitted, in his deposition, that he intended to convey his interest in property to his mother. Carrozza v. Carrozza, 944 A.2d 161, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 39 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Standing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Appellant lacked standing to challenge the mortgage assignments as they were not void since they were distinguished by signature, notarization, delivery, and recordation, and the parties to the assignments treated them as valid; although appellant questioned whether the assignors possessed the requisite authority to execute the assignments, the summary judgment record did not contain sufficient evidence to create a fact issue in that regard. Summers v. Fin. Freedom Acquisition LLC, 807 F.3d 351, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 18507 (1st Cir. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Testamentary Disposition.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the absence of a testamentary devise or a conveyance or declaration of trust signed by testator, a child will not take despite oral declarations made by testator prior to death. Industrial Trust Co. v. McLaughlin, 44 R.I. 350, 117 A. 428, 1922 R.I. LEXIS 53 (1922).</p>

The justice should have first determined whether an implied easement or easement by necessity existed. McElroy v. Stephens, 226 A.3d 1288, 2020 R.I. LEXIS 31 (R.I. 2020).</p>

Such a result occurs without the necessity of a specific mention of the term “appurtenances.” Manish v. Potvin, 472 A.2d 1220, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 472 (R.I. 1984).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A recorder of deeds is a purely ministerial officer who, when presented with a deed executed in compliance with controlling statutes, must receive and record the instrument. Bionomic Church v. Gerardi, 414 A.2d 474, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1555 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Act of a proposed buyer of real estate, who is unable to obtain financing, in recording his purchase-and-sale agreement for the purpose of preventing the owner from selling the property to others is a proper subject of mandatory preliminary injunctive relief barring such misuse of the recording statutes.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mortgagee was not entitled to bona fide purchaser (BFF) status, as it was charged with constructive notice of a debtor’s adverse claim to property under R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 34-13-2 and 34-13-1. It had knowledge that the debtor conveyed the property for clearly inadequate consideration to the grantee/mortgagor and then remained in possession, it had knowledge that the grantee had signed a prior mortgage covenant in which he declared his intention to reside at the property, and a mortgage broker’s successful effort to prevent an interior inspection should have triggered an obligation of further inquiry. Lima v. Conlon (In re Lima), 2012 Bankr. LEXIS 3499 (Bankr. D.R.I. July 30, 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Requirements for Recording of Deeds.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Constructive Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an action for specific performance and damages charging defendants conspired to deprive the plaintiffs of an opportunity to exercise an option to purchase a parcel of real estate, the failure to disclose the right of first refusal to purchase the land described in the lease was not fraudulent where such right was referred to in the lease which was recorded in the land records of the county and thus gave constructive notice to all persons of the recorded document. Davies v. Little, 111 R.I. 496, 304 A.2d 661, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 1235 (1973).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>False Representations.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Action for deceit and false representation of ownership inducing plaintiff to contract to furnish heating apparatus for a house was not barred by plaintiff’s failure to examine land records, because contractor had a right to rely on positive assertion of existing fact and was not put upon inquiry, even though a recorded deed is constructive notice of true state of title to land. Hunt v. Barker, 22 R.I. 18, 46 A. 46, 1900 R.I. LEXIS 42 (1900).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Filing Equivalent to Recording.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Filing deed with clerk is equivalent to entry in record, so far as necessary to perfect title, since filing is implied direction to record, and failure of clerk to make record entry does not affect grantee’s title. Nichols v. Reynolds, 1 R.I. 30, 1835 R.I. LEXIS 2 (1835).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>One Signature Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A mortgage document duly recorded in the appropriate land evidence records gives constructive notice of a significant interest in the property to a bona fide purchaser five years later, despite the failure of one of the two joint mortgagors to execute a mortgage document. In re Barnacle, 623 A.2d 445, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 115 (R.I. 1993).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Only if the grantor has engaged in fraudulent conduct or deceit will the recording of restrictive covenants fail to serve as constructive notice of their content.

<p class="p7"><b>Divorce Proceedings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the superior court and the family court may have concurrent jurisdiction over the partition of real estate in instances in which divorce or separation proceedings have been commenced, when a complaint for partition is addressed to the superior court under circumstances in which a divorce decree of the family court constitutes an impediment to the partition of the real estate, the superior court either may properly dismiss the complaint without prejudice pending application to the family court for modification of the decree constituting the impediment or, in the alternative, may stay proceedings pending such application by the plaintiff to the family court. However, the superior court may not grant partition as though such decree did not exist. Frazier v. Frazier, 472 A.2d 1227, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 475 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Parties.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Upon a bill for partition by tenants in common, the court would not order joinder of mortgagee whose lien extended over the entire tract, such incumbrancer not being a necessary party, as no relief could be decreed against him. Updike v. Adams, 22 R.I. 432, 48 A. 384, 1901 R.I. LEXIS 26 (1901).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trustee in bankruptcy is not a proper party to maintain an action for partition under this section, since it is intended to exclude those who have merely the legal title but are not actually seised or possessed of any estate in their own right. Adelson v. McKenna, 55 R.I. 363, 181 A. 799, 1935 R.I. LEXIS 39 (1935) (decision prior to 1956 amendment.).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Procedure.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a bill in equity for partition of jointly owned realty is a statutory proceeding the strict rules of equity pleading are applicable and respondent should have replied by a demurrer, plea or answer within thirty days after the return day. Dunn v. Dunn, 90 R.I. 386, 158 A.2d 276, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 28 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Right to Partition.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Tenant in common could enforce partition in equity against co-tenants, where no legal objection existed to complainant’s title, even though the result would work hardship on respondents, as partition in equity is a matter of right and not discretionary. Updike v. Adams, 22 R.I. 432, 48 A. 384, 1901 R.I. LEXIS 26 (1901).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where division by metes and bounds was not practicable, this section did not apply insofar as it made partition between joint tenants a matter of right, and the court had discretion under § 34-15-16 as to whether sale would be decreed. Bianchini v. Bianchini, 76 R.I. 30, 68 A.2d 59, 1949 R.I. LEXIS 89 (1949).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-15-12 abrogates the common law right of survivorship in a joint tenancy when an action for partition is pending; when a joint tenant commences a civil action for partition but dies before the case terminates, the statute clearly requires that the action continue to judgment with the heirs or devisees of the decedent, in the same manner as might have been done had the heirs or devisees been original parties in the action.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Except as provided in this section, a landlord may not retaliate by increasing rent or decreasing services or by bringing or threatening to bring an action for possession because:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The tenant has complained to a governmental agency charged with responsibility for enforcement of a building or housing code of a violation applicable to the premises materially affecting health and safety; or</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> If the landlord acts in violation of subsection (a), the tenant is entitled to the remedies provided in § 34-18-34 and has a defense in any retaliatory action against him or her for possession. In an action by or against the tenant, evidence of a complaint within six (6) months before the alleged act of retaliation creates a presumption that the landlord’s conduct was in retaliation. The presumption does not arise if the tenant made the complaint after notice of a proposed rental increase or diminution of services. “Presumption” means that the trier of fact must find the existence of the fact presumed unless and until evidence is introduced which would support a finding of its nonexistence.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), a landlord may bring an action for possession if:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The violation of the applicable building or housing code was caused primarily by lack of reasonable care by the tenant, a member of his or her family, or other person on the premises with his or her consent; or</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> In any instance in which a landowner has been sent a certified letter from an incorporated homeowners’ association indicating that the association has at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the homeowners owning residential dwellings on the landowners’ land as members and has articles of incorporation specifying all rights and powers, including the power to negotiate for and acquire land on behalf of the member homeowners, then, before leased land may be sold for any purpose and before it may be leased for any purpose that would result in a discontinuance, the owner shall notify the association by certified mail of any bona fide offer that the owner intends to accept, to buy the leased land or to lease it for a use that would result in a discontinuance. The owner shall also give notice by certified mail to the incorporated homeowners’ association of any intention to sell or lease the land for a use which will result in a discontinuance within fourteen (14) days of any advertisement or other public notice by the owner or his or her agent that the land is for sale or the land upon which the residential dwelling is located is for lease.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The notice to the homeowners’ association shall include the price, calculated as a single lump sum amount which reflects the present value of any installment payments offered and of any promissory notes offered in lieu of cash payments or, in the case of an offer to rent the capitalized value of the annual rent, and the terms and conditions of the offer. Any incorporated homeowners’ association entitled to notice under this section shall have the right to purchase, in the case of a third party bona fide offer to purchase, or to lease in the case of a third party bona fide offer to lease, the land, provided it meets the same price and the same terms and conditions of any offer of which it is entitled to notice under this section by executing a contract or purchase and sale or lease agreement with the owner within one hundred eighty (180) days of notice of the offer. No owner shall attempt to terminate the tenancy of any member of the incorporated homeowners’ association except for nonpayment of rent for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days following a notice of sale or lease under this section. No owner shall unreasonably refuse to enter into, or unreasonably delay the execution of a purchase and sale or lease agreement with a homeowners’ association that has made a bona fide offer to meet the same price and the same terms and conditions of an offer for which notice is required to be given pursuant to this section. Failure of the incorporated homeowners’ association to execute such a purchase and sale agreement or lease within the first one hundred eighty (180) day period shall serve to terminate the right of the association to purchase or lease the land. The time periods may be extended by agreement of the association and the owner. Nothing herein shall be construed to require an owner to provide financing to any association or to prohibit an owner from requiring an association which is offering to lease land to have within its possession a sum equivalent to the capitalized value of the proposed rent of the land and requiring that a portion of the sum, of an amount necessary to pay the rent on the land for a period of no greater that two (2) years, be kept in escrow for such purpose during the term of the lease. In the event that an incorporated homeowners’ association accepts an offer under this section, the tenancy of the members of the association shall be extended on a month to month basis until the time set in the offer for closing on the offer.</p>

The effective period of the right of first refusal shall apply separately for each substantially different bona fide offer to purchase the land or to lease it for a purpose that would result in a discontinuance, and for each offer the same as an offer made more than three (3) months prior to the later offer; provided, however, that in the case of the same offer made by a prospective buyer who has previously made an offer for which notice to a homeowners’ association was required by this section, the right of first refusal shall apply only if the subsequent offer is made more than six (6) months after the earlier offer. The right of first refusal shall not apply with respect to any offer received by the owner for which notice to a homeowners’ association is not required pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> No right of first refusal shall apply to a government taking by eminent domain or negotiated purchase, a forced sale pursuant to a foreclosure, transfer by gift, devise or operation of law, or a sale to a person who would be included within the table of descent and distribution if there were to be a death intestate of a landowner.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> In any instance in which the incorporated homeowners’ association of leased land is not the successful purchaser or lessee of the land, the seller or lessor of the land shall prove compliance with this section by filing an affidavit of compliance in the official land evidence records of the city or town where the property is located within seven (7) days of the sale or lease of the land.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> No landowner shall attempt to increase any rental amount due regarding leased land from the time of his or her receipt of any bona fide offer to purchase or to lease for a purpose which would result in a discontinuance, until the expiration of the time period during which a homeowners’ association may exercise its right of first refusal or until the time set in the offer for closing on the offer.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> In the event that an owner terminates the tenancies of all of the members of the incorporated association, the right of first refusal created by this section shall inure to the benefit of the former membership of the association for a period of one year after the termination of the tenancies, or until the houses which they occupied are removed or destroyed, whichever first occurs, with the former members having the same rights and obligations as existed prior to the terminations.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> The landowner shall tender a written lease incorporating the terms and conditions of the tenancy to all tenants and prospective tenants. The lease shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The replevin statute applies only when the plaintiff seeks pretrial seizure of personal property pending a trial to determine ownership. When the plaintiff brings a civil action seeking a determination of who owns the personal property at issue and prays for an equitable remedy, the trial justice after a trial on the merits may exercise the equitable powers conferred upon him or her by § 8-2-13 to grant relief such as recovery of personal property. Therefore, the plaintiff does not need to file a writ pursuant to the replevin statute to be entitled to a return of its property after a trial on the merits, he need only pray for this equitable remedy in its complaint. Moseman Constr. Co. v. State DOT, 608 A.2d 34, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 93 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 64, a writ of replevin in accordance with R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-21-1 was issued for a painting sold at auction in 1937 under orders of an organization of the Nazi German government because the possessor’s predecessor-in-interest, who acquired the painting through the forced sale, did not acquire good title to the painting. Vineberg v. Bissonnette, 529 F. Supp. 2d 300, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94509 (D.R.I. 2007), aff'd, 548 F.3d 50, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 24043 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Attached Property.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>After defendant in his plea of property in replevin action asserts his right to present possession of the property replevied, the burden to establish the right to present possession is on the plaintiff.

<p class="p7"><b>Demand for Return.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>No mention is made within this chapter of the necessity of a demand for the return of the goods as a condition precedent to the institution of a replevin action, and such a condition ought not to be read into the replevin statute. Brunswick Corp. v. Sposato, 120 R.I. 673, 389 A.2d 1251, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 708 (1978).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction of Court.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Vendee who filed writ of replevin to secure possession of goods and who was nonsuited since writ returnable to superior court alleged value of the goods at less than minimum jurisdictional amount was not entitled to maintain bill in equity to determine title to goods in his possession since superior court, being without jurisdiction, could not determine title. McKittrick v. Bates, 47 R.I. 240, 132 A. 610, 1926 R.I. LEXIS 40 (1926).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Mortgagee as Plaintiff.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action in replevin may be maintained by a mortgagee against a mortgagor in possession for wood and timber cut upon the mortgaged premises which substantially diminished the security of the mortgagee since the statute permits replevin actions for goods unlawfully detained as well as those unlawfully taken. Waterman v. Matteson, 4 R.I. 539, 1857 R.I. LEXIS 35 (1857).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Possessory Right.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Nothing but a right of present possession founded upon a general or special ownership in goods is necessary to enable a plaintiff to maintain a writ of replevin.

(2) The reverse mortgage loan shall close within one hundred eighty (180) days after the prospective mortgagor(s) sign(s) the counseling certificate. If the reverse mortgage loan does not close within such one hundred eighty (180) day period, the parties shall be required to again comply with the counseling requirements of this section.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The general assembly finds that predatory lending has become an increasing problem in this state, threatening the viability of many communities and causing decreases in home ownership. While the marketplace may appear to be operating effectively for most home loans, too many homeowners are falling victim to unprincipled creditors who provide loans at exorbitant costs and include terms which are unnecessary to secure repayment of the loan. The general assembly finds that as competition and self-regulation have not eliminated the predatory terms for home-secured loans, the consumer protection provisions of this chapter are necessary to encourage responsible lending.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Discharge.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Based on a reading of the plain language of the ancient mortgages statute, § 34-26-7, the period of validity for a 1992 mortgage that stated a term of 10 years, with no maturity date, was 10 years plus five years following expiration of that term; therefore, the superior court properly ruled that the mortgage had been discharged by operation of the statute. Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC v. Providence Bus. Loan Fund, Inc., 200 A.3d 153, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 18 (R.I. 2019).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Extension.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the amended mortgage was recorded, the purported extension of the mortgage set forth in a modification agreement was not recorded in the land evidence records and the modification agreement was the only document that stated the duration of the extension. Thus, the amendment failed to extend the term of the mortgage for the purposes set forth in the ancient mortgages statute, § 34-26-7. Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC v. Providence Bus. Loan Fund, Inc., 200 A.3d 153, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 18 (R.I. 2019).</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> <b>Statement of policy.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is hereby declared that residential mortgage foreclosure actions, caused in part by unemployment and underemployment, have negatively impacted a substantial number of homeowners throughout the state, creating a situation that endangers the economic stability of many of the citizens of this state as the increasing numbers of foreclosures lead to increases in unoccupied and unattended buildings and the unwanted displacement of homeowners and tenants who desire to live and work within the state.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> <b>Purpose.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The statutory framework for foreclosure proceedings is prescribed under the provisions of chapter 27 of this title. As the need for a mortgage mediation process has evolved, it is important for the state to develop a standardized, statewide process for foreclosure mediation rather than a process based on local ordinances that may vary from municipality to municipality. By providing a uniform standard for an early HUD-approved, independent counseling process in owner-occupied principal residence mortgage foreclosure cases, the chances of achieving a positive outcome for homeowners and lenders will be enhanced.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> <b>Definitions.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The following definitions apply in the interpretations of the provisions of this section unless the context requires another meaning:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> “Default” means the failure of the mortgagor to make a timely payment of an amount due under the terms of the mortgage contract, which failure has not been subsequently cured.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> “Good faith” means that the mortgagor and mortgagee deal honestly and fairly with the mediation coordinator with an intent to determine whether an alternative to foreclosure is economically feasible for the mortgagor and mortgagee, as evidenced by some or all of the following factors:</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the bank as the bank did not conduct an illegal foreclosure sale. Despite the trust asserting at oral argument that notice was improper, its written submission to the court was devoid of any mention that the foreclosure sale was improper based on the trust not being notified; and, even if the trust had properly raised the argument that notice was improper in its written submission, that argument lacked merit as the undisputed evidence demonstrated that both mortgagors were mailed written notice of the bank’s intent to foreclose at their last known addresses, in accordance with this section.

<p class="p6">The general assembly finds and declares that the uniqueness of the construction industry requires a special system to ensure that payment is received by those businesses, contractors and owners who expend materials and/or labor prior to the completion of a construction project, but then must wait to be made financially compensated for the materials and/or labor. The general assembly also recognizes that once the materials and labor are placed into the building, or other construction project, it is impossible to reclaim the goods or services so that the only means of compensation is to receive monetary payment. In addition, the general assembly finds that the Comprehensive Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2005 expanded § 523(a) of the Uniform Code of chapter 13, and created a new section known as UC Bankruptcy Code 1328 that gives building material suppliers recourse when a contractor, “commits fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity.” Under the new UC Bankruptcy Code 1328, if any person commits fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny the debt is nondischargeable under chapter 7 (liquidation), chapter 11 (adjustment of debt) or chapter 13 (reorganization).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Amount of Lien.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where subcontractor’s lien for materials and labor was based only on written subcontract for lump sum, the lien cannot be established for more than the total sum remaining unpaid of the contract price, plus interest on all unpaid portions from the time payable. Art Metal Constr. Co. v. Knight, 56 R.I. 228, 185 A. 136, 1936 R.I. LEXIS 98 (1936).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The contract sum, which included a profit, was a reasonable and proper judgment for the holder of a mechanic’s lien. Frank N. Gustafson &amp; Sons v. Walek, 643 A.2d 179, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 230 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Combination of Projects.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A lien under this chapter can be enforced only against the property upon which the labor and materials are bestowed, even though the work is done under a joint contract for work to be performed upon more than one estate. James H. Butler &amp; Co. v. Rivers, 4 R.I. 38, 1856 R.I. LEXIS 7 (1856).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Petitioner, who furnished material and labor to contractor for use in building of two houses on defendant’s property was not entitled to a joint lien against the property for material and labor furnished where the amounts were not segregated as to each house. McElroy v. Keily, 27 R.I. 64, 60 A. 679, 1905 R.I. LEXIS 27 (1905), aff'd in part, vacated in part, 27 R.I. 474, 63 A. 238, 1906 R.I. LEXIS 22 (1906).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Lien could not be enforced for material used in construction of house where material was delivered for use on several jobs but was not designated for use in a particular building. Phillips Lead &amp; Supply Co. v. Swartz, 47 R.I. 203, 132 A. 4, 1926 R.I. LEXIS 30 (1926).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Credit Extended.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff was not barred from asserting a lien for material furnished by the fact that he extended credit for thirty days; instead, this merely suspended his right to enforce his lien. Phillips Lead &amp; Supply Co. v. Swartz, 47 R.I. 203, 132 A. 4, 1926 R.I. LEXIS 30 (1926).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Delivery on General Account.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Materialman was not entitled to lien against owner of dwelling house for materials furnished to contractor on contractor’s general account and delivered without knowledge of where or when they would be used and without reference to the use to be made. H. A. Grimwood Co. v. Greene, 42 R.I. 225, 106 A. 739, 1919 R.I. LEXIS 24 (1919).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Interest on Lien.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Interest was properly allowed from date of notice of claim of lien on balance found to be due on written contract under which final payment was due on completion, even though respondent’s claim by way of recoupment for unsatisfactory workmanship and materials was partially allowed. Pearson v. Ryan, 42 R.I. 83, 105 A. 513, 1919 R.I. LEXIS 7 (1919).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court did not add prejudgment interest referable to the amount a contractor previously recovered pursuant to a partial settlement though prejudgment interest was granted with respect to the amount recovered through a proceeding under the Rhode Island Mechanics’ Lien statute, §§ 34-28-1 to 34-28-36. Commercial Assoc. v. Tilcon Gammino, Inc., 801 F. Supp. 939, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14787 (D.R.I. 1992), aff'd, 998 F.2d 1092, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 18520 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Land Subject to Sale Contract.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A mechanic’s lien cannot be enforced against the equitable interest of one holding possession under a contract of sale where the petition does not run against him. Long Island Brick Co. v. Arnold, 18 R.I. 455, 28 A. 801, 1894 R.I. LEXIS 14 (1894).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A petition for a mechanic’s lien for goods or services furnished by agreement with one in possession of land under a contract of sale cannot be maintained against the legal owner when he is not a party to the agreement for the goods or services. Long Island Brick Co. v. Arnold, 18 R.I. 455, 28 A. 801, 1894 R.I. LEXIS 14 (1894).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a surveyor, in compliance with a purchase-and-sale agreement, was hired by the potential buyer of property to determine the number of possible subdivisions, but the sale was never completed, and the subdivision, as well as any future construction that would have resulted therefrom, was never commenced, the work done by the surveyor does not fall within the parameters of § 34-28-7, and prohibits the plaintiff from enforcing a mechanic’s lien under this section. Federici &amp; Assocs. v. Lantini, 589 A.2d 1202, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 81 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Married Woman’s Property.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is necessary that the consent of the wife be in writing to any contract or request of her husband for work to be done upon her property before her estate can be subjected to a lien. Briggs v. Titus, 7 R.I. 441, 1863 R.I. LEXIS 13 (1863) (decision prior to 1965 amendment).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a contract was made by the wife and the husband had merely withdrawn opposition to the work and permitted it to proceed, a lien could not attach. Cameron v. McCullough, 11 R.I. 173, 1877 R.I. LEXIS 4 (1877).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Materials Furnished.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Dealer in sash, blinds, doors and other similar articles could not claim a lien for such goods furnished for the construction of a house, even though he expended a small amount of labor on the articles furnished, since the labor was incidental to the sale. Arnold v. Budlong, 11 R.I. 561, 1877 R.I. LEXIS 44 (1877).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A contractor who furnishes labor and material in installing wires, conduits, and switching for the purpose of lighting a house is entitled to a mechanic’s lien. Scannevin &amp; Potter v. Consolidated Mineral Water Co., 25 R.I. 318, 55 A. 754, 1903 R.I. LEXIS 70 (1903).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Notice of Lien.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A notice of a lien was fatally defective where it stated that it was pursuant to a section providing for the enforcement of liens, since liens are provided for in this section. Glynn v. Zabriskie, 19 R.I. 215, 36 A. 3, 1895 R.I. LEXIS 94 (1895). See also Art Metal Constr. Co. v. Knight, 56 R.I. 228, 185 A. 136, 1936 R.I. LEXIS 98 (1936).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Practice and Procedure.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A mechanic’s lien proceeding is an equitable in rem proceeding. Such equitable proceedings have always been tried before a justice sitting without a jury. Tilcon Gammino v. Commercial Assoc., 570 A.2d 1102, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 40 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Legal counterclaim raised by respondents does not recharacterize a mechanic’s lien proceeding from an equitable proceeding to an action at law demanding a right to a jury trial. Tilcon Gammino v. Commercial Assoc., 570 A.2d 1102, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 40 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Priority Between Liens.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statute in effect plainly provides that the priorities of lienors of whatever class shall be fully protected. Blackmar v. Sharp, 23 R.I. 412, 50 A. 852, 1901 R.I. LEXIS 163 (1901).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Assignee of Mortgage.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where mortgage given to a third person in consideration of a promise by the grantor of land to advance money to the mortgagor was duly recorded, the lien of such mortgage attached at once and took priority over subsequent mechanic’s lien; and the grantor, who held such mortgage by unrecorded assignment executed after the mechanic’s lien had attached but before any advances were made, could claim the mortgage lien’s priority, because the grantor was an equitable owner thereof at date of its recordation. Blackmar v. Sharp, 23 R.I. 412, 50 A. 852, 1901 R.I. LEXIS 163 (1901).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Purchase Money Mortgage.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mortgage given to secure purchase price and future advances, duly recorded, and given for a valid consideration took priority over subsequent mechanic’s lien for all obligatory advances made by mortgagee under contract with mortgagor, even though mechanic’s lien attached before any advance was made. Blackmar v. Sharp, 23 R.I. 412, 50 A. 852, 1901 R.I. LEXIS 163 (1901).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Subsequent Mortgage.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A master could properly find that the lien had priority over a mortgage given after the work was commenced. J. J. McDonald &amp; Co. v. Kelly, 14 R.I. 335, 1884 R.I. LEXIS 7 (1884).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A mechanics’ lien for labor and material furnished after a mortgage was given took precedence over the mortgage when the cellar of the building had been excavated and the foundation piles driven prior to the time the mortgage was given, since such work constituted the commencement of the construction of the building within the meaning of this section. Bassett v. Swarts, 17 R.I. 215, 21 A. 352, 1891 R.I. LEXIS 9 (1891).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Lien for materials furnished for construction of house on mortgaged premises took priority over mortgage lien, even though materials were furnished after date of the mortgage, where excavation for cellar had been made prior to date of mortgage and there was no abandonment of the work but merely delay of it. Lansing v. Campbell, 41 R.I. 347, 101 A. 1, 1917 R.I. LEXIS 59 (1917).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Time of Attachment of Mortgage.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In question of priority between mortgage and subsequent mechanic’s lien, a mortgage, duly recorded, need not show on its face that it was given for future advances nor need the contract for advances be recorded, but the lien of such mortgage attached from date of recording, as the extent of the incumbrance could be ascertained from the record. Blackmar v. Sharp, 23 R.I. 412, 50 A. 852, 1901 R.I. LEXIS 163 (1901).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Purpose of Statute.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mechanic’s lien statute was designed to prevent unjust enrichment by one person at the expense of another. Art Metal Constr. Co. v. Knight, 56 R.I. 228, 185 A. 136, 1936 R.I. LEXIS 98 (1936); Tilcon Gammino v. Commercial Assoc., 570 A.2d 1102, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 40 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In mechanics’ lien disputes, the law attempts to deal with the familiar dilemma of placing the burden of expense upon one of two individuals who are generally blameless. Faraone v. Faraone, 413 A.2d 90, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1512 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Rhode Island mechanic’s-lien law has long been construed to be a statute intended to afford a liberal remedy to all who have contributed labor or material towards adding to the value of the property to which the lien attaches. Roofing Concepts v. Barry, 559 A.2d 1059, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 112 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mechanics’ lien is not intended as a remedy for those lacking privity of contract. Tilcon Gammino v. Commercial Assoc., 570 A.2d 1102, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 40 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Rental of Equipment.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A bare rental of equipment will not serve as the basis for a mechanic’s lien. Logan Equipment Corp. v. Profile Constr. Co., 585 A.2d 73, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 9 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Rescission of Contract.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Petitioners are entitled to a lien for work performed on an uncompleted project where the respondent has acted in such a manner as to prevent further work from being done. Additionally the petitioners can treat the contract as rescinded. Greene &amp; Brown v. Haley, 5 R.I. 260, 1858 R.I. LEXIS 25 (1858).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Time of Attachment of Lien.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a mechanic commences work by virtue of a contract with the owner of the land, his lien attaches from that moment. Blackmar v. Sharp, 23 R.I. 412, 50 A. 852, 1901 R.I. LEXIS 163 (1901).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Excavation for cellar on lot in real estate subdivision was constructive notice that liens for labor and materials in further construction work might attach and be entitled to priority. Lansing v. Campbell, 41 R.I. 347, 101 A. 1, 1917 R.I. LEXIS 59 (1917).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A mechanic’s lien comes into existence when the work begins or the materials are furnished. Art Metal Constr. Co. v. Knight, 56 R.I. 228, 185 A. 136, 1936 R.I. LEXIS 98 (1936).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Work Performed.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The intent of the legislature in enacting this section was to provide a remedy by which a supplier of labor or materials could recover on a bond, this remedy to be in addition to other statutory remedies whose notice provisions are inapplicable. Providence Elec. Co. v. Donatelli Bldg. Co., 116 R.I. 340, 356 A.2d 483, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1283 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Alternate Remedies.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Steel supplier could maintain an action under this section, regardless of the remedy that might have been available to it under the contractors’ bond provisions of Chapter 12 of Title 37. Bethlehem Rebar Indus. v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 582 A.2d 442, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 165 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Application of Mechanics’ Lien Statutes.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A supplier of material can recover from a general contractor for the value of material supplied without giving notice to the general contractor by certified mail as is contemplated in the contractors’ bonds statute, because the supplier’s remedy is provided for by the mechanics’ lien statutes which act as a supplement to the contractors’ bonds provisions. Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Co. v. Forte Bros., Inc., 474 A.2d 1250, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 505 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subcontractor could sue an insurer under a payment bond that failed to limit the scope of its coverage to just construction-management services and allowed subcontractors to sue on the bond in assumpsit for unpaid supplies, materials, and labor. Extrusions Inc., Win-Vent Div. v. Nat'l Grange Mut. Ins. Co., 824 A.2d 439, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 152 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Notification of Claim.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Union is not estopped from bringing a claim for unpaid fringe benefits against a general contractor and the contractor’s surety because of its failure to notify them of the claim prior to instituting court action. This section clearly states that such notice is not required before an action may lie. International Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Local No. 99 v. United Pac. Ins. Co., 573 A.2d 270, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 81 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Time Limitations.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where contractor’s bond for labor and materials contained a clause stating that any action on the bond must be commenced within one year after the principal ceased work on the project a suit brought after such period was properly dismissed. Vaudreuil v. Nelson Eng'g &amp; Constr. Co., 121 R.I. 418, 399 A.2d 1220, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1794 (1979).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a condominium association’s declaratory judgment action, a trial court properly determined that a condominium unit owner was not permitted to rent his unit to a third tenant because the unambiguous condominium declaration clearly stated that a unit could not be rented more than two times in a single calendar year, the owner held individual, month-to-month tenancies with two tenants and, as such, the owner had reached the maximum number of annual rentals that were allowed under the declaration; thus, the owner’s proposed third lease agreement violated the declaration.

<p class="p5">Annotations</p>
<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. The question of the extent to which a state statute should apply to particular condominiums involves two problems: first, the extent to which the statute should require or permit different results from condominiums created before and after the statute becomes effective; and second, whether the statute should impose any or all of its substantive requirements on condominiums located outside the state.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Two conflicting policies are proposed when considering the applicability of this Act to “old” and “new” condominiums located in the enacting state. On the one hand, it is desirable, for reasons of uniformity, for the Act to apply to all condominiums located in a particular state, regardless of whether the condominium was created before or after adoption of the Act in that state. To the extent that different laws apply within the same state to different condominiums, confusion results in the minds of both lenders and consumers. Moreover, because of the inadequacies and uncertainties of condominiums created under old law, and because of the requirements placed on declarants and unit owners’ associations by this Act which might increase the costs of new condominiums, different markets might tend to develop for condominiums created before and after adoption of the Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>On the other hand, to make all provisions of this Act automatically apply to “old” condominiums might violate the constitutional prohibition of impairment of contracts. In addition, aside from the constitutional issue, automatic applicability of the entire Act almost certainly would unduly alter the legitimate expectations of some present unit owners and declarants.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Accordingly, the philosophy of this section reflects a desire to maximize the uniform applicability of the Act to all condominiums in the enacting state, while avoiding the difficulties raised by automatic application of the entire Act to pre-existing condominiums.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. In carrying out this philosophy with respect to “new” condominiums, the Act applies to all condominiums “created” within the state after the Act’s effective date. This is the effect of the first sentence of subsection (a). The first sentence of subsection (b) makes clear that the provisions of old statutes expressly applicable to condominiums do <i>not </i>apply to condominiums created after the effective date of this Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Creation” of a condominium pursuant to this Act occurs upon recordation of a declaration pursuant to Section [34-36.1-2.01]; however, the definition of “condominium” in Section [34-36.1-1.03(7)] contemplates that <i>de facto </i>condominiums may exist, if the nature of the ownership interest fits the definition, and the Act would apply to such a condominium. Any real estate project which includes individually owned units and common elements owned by the unit owners as tenants in common is therefore subject to the Act if created within the state after the Act’s effective date. No intent to subject the condominium to the Act is required, and an express intention to the contrary would be invalid and ineffective.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. The section adopts a novel three-step approach to condominiums created before the effective date of the Act. First, certain provisions of the Act automatically apply to “old” condominiums, but only prospectively, and only in a manner which does not invalidate provisions of condominium declarations and bylaws valid under “old” law. Second, “old” law remains applicable to previously created condominiums where not automatically displaced by the Act. Third, owners of “old” condominiums may amend any provisions of their declaration or bylaws, even if the amendment would not be permitted by “old” law, so long as (a) the amendment is adopted in accordance with the procedure required by “old” law and the existing declaration and bylaws, and (b) the substance of the amendment does not violate this Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Elaboration of the principles described in Comment 3 may be helpful.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>First, the second sentence of subsection (a) provides that the enumerated provisions automatically apply to condominiums created under pre-existing law, even though no action is taken by the unit owners. Many of the sections which do apply should measurably increase the ability of the unit owners to effectively manage the association, and should help to encourage the marketability of condominiums created under early condominium statutes. To avoid possible constitutional challenges, these provisions, as applied to “old” condominiums, apply only to “events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this Act”; moreover, the provisions of this Act are subject to the provisions of the instruments creating the condominium, and this Act does not invalidate those instruments.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. In considering the permissible amendments under subsection (b), it is important to distinguish between the law governing the procedure for amending declarations, and the substance of the amendments themselves. An amendment to the declaration of the condominium created under “old” law, even if permissible under this Act, must nevertheless be adopted “in conformity with the procedures and requirements specified” by the original condominium instruments, and in compliance with the old law.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. The last sentence of subsection (b) addresses the potential problem of a declarant seeking to take undue advantage of the amendment provisions to assume a power granted by the Act without being subject to the Act’s limitations on the power. The last sentence insures that, if declarants or other persons assume any of the powers and rights which the Act grants, the correlative obligations, liabilities, and restrictions of the Act also apply to that person, even if the amendment itself does not require that result.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. [Enacting instructions.]</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>8. [Enacting instructions.]</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>9. This section does not permit a pre-existing condominium to elect to come entirely within the provisions of the Act, disregarding old law. However, the owners of a pre-existing condominium may elect to terminate the condominium under pre-existing law and create a new condominium which would be subject to all the provisions of this Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>10. Subsection (c) reflects the fact that there are practical as well as constitutional limits regarding the extent to which a state should or may extend its jurisdiction to out-of-state transactions. A state may, of course, properly exercise its authority to protect its citizens from false or misleading information relating to condominiums located in other states but sold in this state. However, where sale contracts are executed solely outside the enacting state and relate to condominiums located outside the state, it seems more appropriate for the courts of the jurisdiction(s) in which the condominium is located and where the transaction occurs to have jurisdiction over the transaction.</p>

<p class="p5">Annotations</p>
<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. The first clause of this section permits the defined terms used in the Act to be defined differently in the declaration and bylaws. Regardless of how terms are used in those documents, however, terms have an unvarying meaning in the Act, and any restricted practice which depends on the definition of a term is not affected by a changed term in the documents.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. The definition of “affiliate of a declarant” (Section [34-36.1-1.03(1)]) is similar to the definitions in 12 U.S.C. § 1730(a), which prescribes the authority of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to regulate the activities of savings and loan holding companies, and in 15 U.S.C. § 78(c)(18), which defines persons deemed to be associated with a broker or dealer for purposes of the federal securities laws.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The objective standards of the definition permit a ready determination of the existence of affiliate status to be made. Unlike 12 U.S.C. § 1730(a)(2)(B), no power is vested in an agency to subjectively determine the existence of “control” necessary to establish affiliate status. Thus, affiliate status does not exist under the Act unless these objective criteria are met.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Definition (2), “allocated interests,” refers to all of the interests which this Act requires the declaration to allocate. <i>See </i>Section [34-36.1-2.07].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Definitions (4) and (25) [(28)], treating “common elements” and “units,” should be examined in light of Section [34-36.1-2.02], which specifies in detail how the precise differentiation between units and common elements is to be determined in any given condominium to the extent that the declaration does not provide a different scheme. No exhaustive list of items comprising the common elements is necessary in this Act or in the declaration; as long as the boundaries between units and common elements can be ascertained with certainty, the common elements include by definition all of the real estate in the condominium not designated as part of the units.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Definition (7), “condominium,” makes clear that, unless the ownership interest in the common elements is vested in the owners of the units, the project is not a condominium. Thus, for example, if the common elements were owned by an association in which each unit owner was a member, the project would not be a condominium. Similarly, if a declarant sold units in a building but retained title to the common areas, granting easements over them to unit owners, no condominium would have been created. Such projects have many of the attributes of condominiums, but they are not covered by this Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Definition (8), “conversion building,” is important because of the protection which the Act provides in Section [34-36.1-1.10] for tenants of buildings which are being converted into a condominium. The definition distinguishes between buildings which have never been occupied by any person before the time that the building is submitted to the condominium form of ownership, and buildings, whether new or old, which have been previously occupied by tenants. In the former case, because there have been no tenants in the building, the building would not be a conversion building, and no protection of tenants is necessary.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. Definition (9), “declarant,” is designed to exclude persons who may be called upon to execute the declaration in order to ratify the creation of the condominium, but who are not intended to be charged with the responsibilities imposed on declarants by this Act if that is all they do. Examples of such persons include holders of pre-existing liens and, in the case of leasehold condominiums, ground lessors. (Of course, such a person could become a declarant by subsequently succeeding to a special declarant right.) Other persons similarly protected by the narrow wording of this definition include real estate brokers, because they do not offer to dispose of their own interest in a unit. Similarly, unit owners reselling their units are not declarants because their units were “previously disposed of ” when originally conveyed.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>[Enacting instruction.]</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>8. Definition (11), “development rights,” includes a panoply of sophisticated development techniques that have evolved over time throughout the United States and which have been expressly recognized (and regulated) in an increasing number of jurisdictions, beginning with Virginia in 1974.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Some of these techniques relate to the phased (or incremental) development of condominiums which the declarant hopes, but cannot be sure, will be successful enough to grow to include more land than he is initially willing to commit to the condominium. For example, a declarant may be building (or converting) a 50-unit building on Parcel A with the intention, if all goes well, to “expand” the condominium by adding an additional building on Parcel B, containing additional units, as part of the same condominium. If he reserves the right to do so, <i>i. e., </i>to “add real estate to a condominium,” he has reserved a “development right.”</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In certain cases, however, the declarant may desire, for a variety of reasons, to include both parcels in the condominium from the outset, even though he may subsequently be obliged to withdraw all or part of one parcel. Assume, for example, that in the example just given the declarant intends to build an underground parking garage that will extend into both parcels. If the project is a success, his documentation will be simpler if both parcels were included in the condominium from the beginning. If his hopes are not realized, however, and it becomes necessary to withdraw all or part of Parcel B from the condominium and devote it to some other use, he may do so if he has reserved such a development right “to withdraw real estate from a condominium.” The portion of the garage which extends into Parcel B may be left in the condominium (separated from the remainder of Parcel B by a horizontal boundary), or the garage may be divided between Parcels A and B with appropriate cross-easement agreements.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The right “to create units, common elements, or limited common elements” is frequently useful in commercial or mixed-use condominiums where the declarant needs to retain a high degree of flexibility to meet the space requirements of prospective purchasers who may not approach him until the condominium has already been created. For example, an entire floor of a high-rise building may be intended for commercial buyers, but the declarant may not know in advance whether one purchaser will want to buy the whole floor as a single unit or whether several purchasers will want the floor divided into several units, separated by common element walls and served by a limited common element corridor. This development right is sometimes useful even in purely residential condominiums, especially those designed to appeal to affluent buyers. Similarly, the development rights “to subdivide units or convert units into common elements” is most often of value in commercial condominiums, but can occasionally be useful in certain kinds of residential condominiums as well.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>9. Definition (12) [(13)], “dispose” or “disposition,” includes voluntary transfers to purchasers of any interest in a unit, other than as security for an obligation. Consequently, the grant of a mortgage or other security interest is not a “disposition,” nor is any transfer of any interest to a person who is excluded from the definition of “purchaser,” <i>infra. </i>However, the term includes more than conveyances and would, for example, cover contracts of sale.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>10. Definition (15) [(18)], “leasehold condominium,” should be distinguished from land which is leased to a condominium but not subjected to the condominium regime. A leasehold condominium means, by definition, real estate which has been subjected to the condominium form of ownership. In such a case, units located on the leasehold real estate are typically leased for long terms. At the expiration of such a lease, the condominium unit or the real estate underlying the unit would be removed from the condominium if the lease were not extended or renewed. On the other hand, real estate may not be subjected to condominium ownership, but may be leased directly to the association or to one or more unit owners for a term of years.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This distinction is very significant. Under Section [34-36.1-3.05], the unit owners’ association is empowered, following expiration of the period of declarant control, to cancel any lease of recreational or parking areas or facilities to which it is a party, regardless of who the lessor is. The association also has the power to cancel any lease for any land if the declarant or an affiliate of the declarant is a party to that lease. If the leased real estate, however, is subjected by the declarant to condominium form of ownership, that lease may not be cancelled unless it is unconscionable or unless the real estate was submitted to the condominium regime for the purpose of avoiding the right to terminate the lease. <i>See </i>Section [34-36.1-3.05].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the subjective test of declarant’s “purpose” may not always be clear, the rights of the association to cancel a lease depend upon the test. Thus, for example, a declarant who wishes to lease a swimming pool to the unit owners would have a choice of subjecting the pool for, say, a term of 20 years to the condominium form of ownership as a common element. At the end of the term, the lease would terminate and the real estate containing the pool would be automatically removed from the condominium unless there were a right to renew the lease. During the 20-year term, the lease would not be cancellable, regardless of the terms, unless it were found to be unconscionable under Section [34-36.1-1.10], or cancellable because submitted for the purpose of avoiding the right to cancel. On the other hand, if the pool were not submitted to the condominium form of ownership and was leased directly to the association for a 20-year term, the association could cancel that lease 90 days after the period of declarant control expired, even if, for example, 18 years remained of the term.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In either case, the terms of the lease would have to be disclosed in the public offering statement.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>11. Definition (20) [(23)], “purchaser,” includes a person who acquires any interest in a unit, even as a tenant, if his tenancy entitles him to occupy the premises for more than 20 years. This would include a tenant who holds a lease of a unit in a fee simple condominium for one year, if the lease entitles the tenant to renew the lease for more than 4 additional years. Excluded from the definition, however, are mortgagees, declarants, and people in the business of selling real estate for their account. Persons excluded from the definition of “purchaser” do not receive certain benefits under Article 4, such as the right to a public offering statement (Section [34-36.1-4.02(c)]) and the right to rescind (Section [34-36.1-4.08] ).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>12. Definition (21) [(24)], “real estate,” is very broad, and is very similar to the definition of “real estate” in Section 1-201(16) of the Uniform Land Transactions Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although often thought of in two-dimensional terms, real estate is a three-dimensional concept and the third dimension is unusually important in the condominium context. Where real estate is described in only two dimensions (length and width), it is correctly assumed that the property extends indefinitely above the earth’s surface and downwards toward a point in the center of the planet. In most condominiums, however, as in so-called “air rights” projects, ownership does not extend <i>ab solo usque ad coelum, </i>because units are stacked on top of units or units and common elements are interstratified. In such cases the upper and lower boundaries must be identified with the same precision as the other boundaries.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>13. Definition (23) [(26)], “special declarant rights,” seeks to isolate those rights reserved for the benefit of a declarant which are unique to the declarant and not shared in common with other unit owners. The list, while short, encompasses virtually every significant right which a declarant might seek in the course of creating or expanding a condominium.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Any person who possesses a special declarant right would be a “declarant”, including any who succeed under Section [34-36.1-3.04] to any of those rights. Thus, the concept of special declarant rights triggers the imposition of obligations on those who possess the rights. Under Section [34-36.1-3.04], those obligations vary significantly, depending upon the particular special declarant rights possessed by a particular declarant. These circumstances are described more fully in the comments to Section [34-36.1-3.04].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>14. Definition (24) [(27)], “time share,” is based on Section 1-102(14) and (18) of the Uniform Law Commissioners’ Model Real Estate Time-Share Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>15. Definition (25) [(28)], “unit,” describes a tangible, physical part of the project, rather than a right in, or claim to, a tangible physical part of the property. Therefore, for example, a “time-share” arrangement in which a unit is sold to 12 different persons each of whom has the right to occupy the unit for one month does not create 12 new units — there are, rather, 12 owners of the unit. (Under the section on voting (Section [34-36.1-2.10]), a majority of the time-share owners of a unit are entitled to cast the votes assigned to that unit.)</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While a separately described part of the project is not a unit unless it is designed for, and is subject to, separate ownership by persons other than the association, the association developer can hold or acquire units unless otherwise provided in the declaration. <i>See, </i>also, Comment 4.</p>

Definition (26) [(29)], “unit owners,” contemplates that a seller under a land installment contract would remain the unit owner until the contract is fulfilled.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The definition makes it clear that declarants, so long as they own units in the condominium, are unit owners and are therefore subject to all of the obligations imposed on other unit owners, including the obligation to pay common expense assessments against those units.

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. The Act is generally designed to provide great flexibility in the creation of condominiums and, to that end, the Act permits the parties to vary many of its provisions. In many instances, however, provisions of the Act may not be varied, because of the need to protect purchasers, lenders, and declarants. Accordingly, this section adopts the approach of prohibiting variation by agreement except in those cases where it is expressly permitted by the terms of the Act itself.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. One of the consumer protections in this Act is the requirement for consent by specified percentages of unit owners to particular actions or changes in the declaration. In order to prevent declarants from evading these requirements by obtaining powers of attorney from all unit owners, or in some other fashion controlling the votes of unit owners, this section forbids the use by a declarant of any device to evade the limitations or prohibitions of the Act or of the declaration.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. The following sections permit variation:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><i>Section [34-36.1-1.02]. Applicability. </i>Pre-existing condominiums may elect to conform to the Act.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><i>Section [34-36.1-3.13]. Insurance. </i>The declaration may vary the provisions of this section in non-residential condominiums, and may require additional insurance in any condominium.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><i>Section [34-36.1-3.14]. Surplus Funds. </i>Unless otherwise provided in the declaration, surplus funds are paid or credited to unit owners in proportion to common expense liability.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><i>Section [34-36.1-3.15]. Assessments for Common Expenses. </i>To the extent otherwise provided in the declaration, common expenses for limited common elements must be assessed against the units to which they are assigned, common expenses benefiting fewer than all the units must be assessed only against the units benefited, insurance costs must be assessed in proportion to risk, and utility costs must be assessed in proportion to usage.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><i>Section [34-36.1-4.01]. Applicability; Waiver. </i>All of Article 4 is modifiable or waivable by agreement in a condominium restricted to non-residential use.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. The second sentence of the section is an important limitation upon the rights of a declarant. It is the practice in many jurisdictions today, particularly jurisdictions which do not permit expansion of a condominium by statute, for a declarant to secure powers of attorney from all unit purchasers permitting the declarant unilaterally to expand the condominium by “unanimous consent” to include new units and to reallocate common element interests, common expense liability, and votes. With such powers of attorney, many declarants have purported to comply with the typical provision of “first generation” condominium statutes requiring unanimous consent for amendments of the declaration concerning such matters.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Section [34-36.1-2.17] requires unanimous consent to make certain amendments to the declaration and bylaws. If a declarant were permitted to use powers of attorney to accomplish such changes, the substantial protection which Section [34-36.1-2.17(d)] provides to unit owners would be illusory. Section [34-36.1-1.04] prohibits the declarant from using powers of attorney for such purposes.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. While freedom of contract is a principle of this Act, and variation by agreement is accordingly widely available, freedom of contract does not extend so far as to permit parties to disclaim obligations of good faith, <i>see </i>Section [34-36.1-1.03], or to enter into contracts which are unconscionable when viewed as a whole, or which contain unconscionable terms. <i>See </i>Section [34-36.1-1.10]. This section derives from Section 1-102(3) of the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. A condominium may be created, by the recordation of a declaration, long before the first unit is conveyed. This happens frequently with existing rental apartment projects which are converted into condominiums. Subsection (d) spares the local taxing authorities from having to assess each unit separately until such time as the declarant begins conveying units, although separate assessment from the date the condominium is created may be permitted under other law. <i>See </i>subsection (d). When separate tax assessments become mandatory under this section, the assessment for each unit must include the value of that unit’s common element interest, and no separate tax bill on the common elements is to be rendered to the association or the unit owners collectively. Any common elements subject to development rights, however, are separately taxed to the declarant.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Even if real estate subject to development rights is a part of the condominium and lawfully “owned” by the unit owners in common, it is in fact an asset of the declarant, and must not be taxed and assessed against unit owners. Under subsection (c), the declarant is exclusively liable for those taxes.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. If there is any question in a particular state that a unit occupied as a residential dwelling is not entitled to treatment as any other residential single-family detached dwelling under the homestead statutes, this section should be modified to insure that units are similarly treated.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Unlike the law of New York and perhaps other states, this section imposes no limitation on the power of a jurisdiction to tax the condominium unit based on its fair market value. In most jurisdictions, experience has shown that the conversion of an apartment building to the condominium form of ownership greatly increases the fair market value of that building. Accordingly, a jurisdiction under this Act may impose real estate taxes on condominium units which reflect the fair market value of those units in the same way that the jurisdiction taxes other forms of real estate.</p>

<p class="p6">A zoning, subdivision, building code, or other real estate use law, ordinance, or regulation may not prohibit the condominium form of ownership or impose any requirement upon a condominium which it would not impose upon a physically identical development under a different form of ownership, or otherwise regulate the creation, governance, or existence of the condominium form of ownership.

<p class="p5">Annotations</p>
<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. The first sentence of this section prohibits discrimination against condominiums by local law-making authorities. Thus, if a local law, ordinance, or regulation imposes a requirement which cannot be met if property is subdivided as a condominium but which would not be violated if all of the property constituting the condominium were owned by a single owner, this section makes it unlawful to apply that requirement or restriction to the condominium. For example, in the case of a high-rise apartment building, if a local requirement imposing a minimum number of parking spaces per apartment would not prevent a rental apartment building from being built, this Act would override any requirement that might impose a higher number of spaces per apartment merely by virtue of the same building being owned as a condominium.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. The second sentence makes clear that, except for the prohibition on discrimination against condominiums, the Act has no effect on real estate use laws. For example, a particular piece of real estate submitted to the condominium form of ownership might be of such size that all of the real estate is required to support a proposed density of units or to satisfy minimum setback requirements. Under this Act, part of the submitted real estate might be subject to a development right entitling the declarant to withdraw it from the condominium, but the mere reservation of this right would not constitute a subdivision of the parcel into separate ownership. If a declarant or foreclosing lender at a later time sought to exercise the option to withdraw the real estate, however, withdrawal would constitute a subdivision and would be illegal if the effect of withdrawal would be to violate setback requirements, or to exceed the density of units permitted on the remaining parcel.</p>

<p class="p5">Annotations</p>
<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. The provisions of this statute are not intended to supplant the usual rules of eminent domain but merely to supplement the rules to address the unique problems which eminent domain raises in the context of a <i>condominium. </i>Nevertheless, because the law of eminent domain differs widely among the various states, the law of each state should be reviewed to ensure that the eminent domain code and this section are properly integrated.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. When a unit is taken or partially taken by eminent domain, this section provides for a recalculation of the allocated interests of all units.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. An important issue raised by this section is whether or not a governmental body acquiring a unit by eminent domain has a right to also take that unit’s allocated interests and thereby assume membership in the association by virtue of its power of eminent domain. While there is no question that a governmental body may acquire any real property by eminent domain, there is no case law on the question of whether or not the governmental body may take a condominium unit as a part of the condominium or must take the unit and have the unit excluded from the condominium.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (a) merely requires that the taking body compensate the unit owner for all of his unit and its interest in the common elements, whether or not the common element interest is acquired. The Act also requires that the allocated interests are automatically reallocated upon taking to the remaining units unless the decree provides otherwise. Whether or not the decree may constitutionally provide otherwise in the case of a particular taking (for example, by allocating the common element interest, votes, and common expense liability to the government) is an unanswered question.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. In the circumstances of a taking of part of a unit, it is important to have some objective test by which to measure the portion of allocated interest to be reallocated. Subsection (b) sets forth a formula based on relative size, but permits the declaration to vary that formula to some other more appropriate formula in a particular circumstance.

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. A condominium is created pursuant to this Act only by recording a declaration. As with any instrument affecting real estate, the declaration must be recorded in every recording district in which any portion of the condominium is located and must be indexed in the manner described in subsection (a). Specific indexing rules are suggested in brackets and should be used in those states where this result would not otherwise occur. For example, the declaration commonly has not been indexed in the grantee’s index in the name of the condominium. Moreover, when multiple persons execute the declaration, the declaration has often been indexed solely in the name of the declarant and not in the name, for example, of lenders and other persons who might have executed the declaration. Because it is important that the names of the association and all persons executing the declaration appear in the index in order to locate all instruments in the land records, that language is not included in brackets.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. In Section [34-36.1-1.03], the Act defines the term “Declaration” as any instruments, however denominated, which create a condominium, and any amendments to those instruments. “Condominium,” in turn, is defined as “real estate, portions of which are designated for separate ownership and the remainder of which is designated for common ownership solely by the owners of those portions.” It is important to emphasize that other covenants, conditions or restrictions applicable to the real estate in the condominium might be recorded before or after the instruments are recorded which divide the real estate into units and common elements, thereby creating the condominium.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Until the actual recordation of the document which accomplished that result, however, the condominium has not been created.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. A condominium has not been lawfully created unless the requirements of this section have been complied with. Nevertheless, a project which meets the definition of “condominium” in Section [34-36.1-1.03(7)] is subject to this Act even if this or other sections of the Act have not been complied with.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Mortgagees and other lienholders need not execute the declaration, and foreclosure of a mortgage or other lien will not, of itself, terminate the condominium. However, if that lien is prior to the declaration itself, the lienholder may exclude that real estate from the condominium. <i>See </i>Sections [34-36.1-2.18(i) and (j)]. Moreover, the declarant may wish to obtain agreements from mortgagees or other lienholders that they will give partial releases permitting lien-free conveyance of the condominium units. <i>See </i>Section [34-36.1-4.11(a)].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Except when development proceeds pursuant to Section 5-103 [Not enacted in Rhode Island], this Act contemplates that two different stages of construction must be reached before (1) a condominium may be created or (2) a unit in the condominium may be conveyed. These stages are described, respectively, in subsection (b) and Section [34-36.1-4.20]. The purpose of imposing these requirements is to insure that a purchaser will in fact take title to a unit which may be used for its intended purpose.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a condominium were said to consist from the beginning of a certain number of units, even though some of those units had not yet been completed or even begun, serious problems would arise if the remaining units were never constructed and if no obligation to complete the construction could be enforced against any solvent person. If the insolvent owner of the unbuilt units failed to pay his common expense assessments for example, the unit owners’ association might be left with no remedy except a lien of doubtful value against mere cubicles of airspace. Moreover, votes in the unit owners’ association could be assigned to units, and those votes could be cast, even though the units were never built. The Act therefore requires that significant construction take place before units are assigned an interest in the common elements, a vote in the association, and a share of the common expense liabilities, and before units are conveyed. This requirement of substantial completion (or the alternative bonding procedure and other assurances required by Section 5-103 [Not enacted in Rhode Island]) reduces the possibility that a failure to complete will upset the expectations of purchasers or otherwise harm their interests in case the declarant becomes insolvent and no solvent person has the obligation to complete the unit.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Section [34-36.1-2.01(b)] requires that “all structural components and mechanical systems of all buildings containing or comprising any units” which will be created by recording a declaration, must be substantially completed in accordance with the plans. The intent of subsection (b) is that if any buildings are depicted on the plats and plans which are required by Section [34-36.1-2.09], and these buildings contain or comprise spaces which become units by virtue of recording the declaration, the structural components and mechanical systems of these buildings must be substantially complete before the declaration is recorded. This is required even though the plats and plans recorded pursuant to Section [34-36.1-2.09] depict only the boundaries of the buildings and the units created in those buildings, and not the structural components or mechanical systems (which need not be shown). If the boundaries of units are not depicted, of course, then no units are created. If the declarant fails to comply with this section, title is not affected. <i>See </i>Comment 8, below.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The concept of “structural components and mechanical systems” is one commonly understood in the construction field and this comment is not intended as a comprehensive list of those components. For example, however, the term “structural components” is generally understood to include those portions of a building necessary to keep any part of the building from collapsing, and to maintain the building in a weathertight condition. This would include the foundations, bearing walls and columns, exterior walls, roof, floors and similar components. It would clearly not include such components as interior non-bearing partitions, surface finishes, interior doors, carpeting, and the like. Similarly, typical examples of “mechanical systems” include the plumbing, heating, air conditioning and other like systems. Whether or not “electrical systems” are included within the meaning of the term depends on local practice.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. Section [34-36.1-4.20], requires that, before an individual unit is conveyed, the unit must be “substantially completed.” “Substantial completion” is a well understood term in the construction industry. For example, the American Institute of Architects Document A201, General Conditions of the Contract for Construction (1976 Ed.) at para. 8.1.3, states:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>The Date of Substantial Completion of the Work . . . is the date certified by the Architect when construction is sufficiently complete, in accordance with the Contract Documents (that is, the owner-contractor agreement, the conditions of the contract, and the specifications and all addenda and modifications), so the Owner can occupy or utilize the Work . . . for the use for which it is intended.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This standard is also one often used by building officials in issuing certificates of occupancy. It does not suggest that the unit is “entirely completed” as that term is understood in the construction industry; lesser details, such as sticking doors, leaking windows, or some decorative items, might still remain, and the Act contemplates that they need not be completed prior to lawful conveyance.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>8. Sections [34-36.1-2.01(b)] and [34-36.1-4.20] require that completion certificates be recorded, or local certificates of occupancy be issued, as evidence of the fact that the required levels of construction have been met. In the case of “substantial completion,” issuance of “a certificate of occupancy authorized by law,” as is commonly required by local ordinance or state building codes, will suffice. Once the certificates have been recorded, or issued, as the case may be, good title to the units may be conveyed in reliance on the record. It is possible, of course, that the declarant may have failed to complete the required levels of construction; the architect, surveyor or engineer (whichever is appropriate in a particular jurisdiction) may have filed a false certificate. Such acts would create a cause of action in the purchaser under Section [34-36.1-4.15], but would not affect the validity of the purchasers’ title to the condominium.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>9. The requirement of “substantial completion” does not mean that the declarant must complete all buildings in which all possible units would be located before creating the condominium. If only some of the buildings in which units which may ultimately be located have been “structurally” completed, the declarant may create a condominium in which he reserves particular development rights (Section [34-36.1-2.05(a)(8)]). In such a project, only the completed units might be treated as units from the outset, and the development rights would be reserved to create additional units, either by adding additional real estate and units to the condominium, by creating new units on common elements, or by subdividing units previously created. The optional units may never be completed or added to the condominium; however, this will not affect the integrity of the condominium as originally created.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>10. Requiring “substantial completion” of the structural components and mechanical systems in the buildings containing or comprising the units in a condominium may encourage creation of more phased condominiums under Section [34-36.1-2.05] in projects which once were in fact built in phases, but under a single nonexpandable declaration. Experience in the several states where significantly more rigorous requirements are imposed by statute, however, has shown that this does not create a difficult situation either for the developer or the lender. Moreover, it appears likely that the size of the initial phase of a multi-building project will be dictated largely by economics, as occurs in most jurisdictions today, rather than this Act. Finally, many lenders and developers are increasingly sensitive to the secondary mortgage market requirements particularly those of the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). Experience indicates that the pre-sale requirements imposed by FNMA and FHLMC frequently dictate that multi-building condominium projects be structured on a phased or expandable condominium basis.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>11. The requirement of completion would be irrelevant in some types of condominiums, such as campsite condominiums or some subdivision condominiums where the units might consist of unimproved lots, and the airspace above them, within which each purchaser would be free to construct or not construct a residence. Any residence actually constructed would ordinarily become a part of the “unit” by the doctrine of fixtures, but nothing in this Act would require any residence to be built before the lots could be treated as units.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>12. The term “independent” architect, surveyor or engineer in subsection (b) and elsewhere in the Act distinguishes any such professional person who acts as an independent contractor in his relationship to the declarant or lender.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For example, in a townhouse project structured as a condominium, it may be desirable that the boundaries of the unit constitute the exterior surfaces of the roof and exterior walls, with the center line of the party walls constituting the perimetric boundaries of the units in that plane, and the undersurface of the bottom slab dividing the unit itself from the underlying land. Alternatively, the boundaries of the units at the party walls might be extended to include actual division of underlying land itself. In those cases it would not be appropriate for walls, floors and ceilings to be designated as boundaries, and the declaration would describe the boundaries in the above manner. The differentiations made clear here, in conjunction with the provisions of Section [34-36.1-3.07], will assist in minimizing disputes which have historically arisen in association administration with respect to liability for repair of such things as pipes, porches and other components of a building which unit owners may expect the association to pay for and which the association may wish to have repaired by unit owners. Problems which may arise as a result of negligence in the use of components — such as stoops and pipes — are resolved by Section [34-36.1-3.07], which imposes liability on the unit owner who causes damage to common elements, or under the broader provisions of Section [34-36.1-3.15(e)], which permits the association to assess common expenses “caused by the misconduct of any unit owner” exclusively against that owner. This would include, of course, not only damages to common elements, but fines or unusual service fees, such as cleanup costs, incurred as a result of the unit owner’s misuse of common elements.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. The differentiation between components constituting common elements and components which are part of the units is particularly important in light of Section [34-36.1-3.07(a)], which (subject to the exceptions therein mentioned) makes the association responsible for upkeep of common elements and each unit owner individually responsible for upkeep of his unit.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. The differentiation between unit components and common element components may or may not be important for insurance purposes under this Act. While the common elements in a project must always be insured, the units themselves need not be insured by the association unless the project contains units divided by horizontal boundaries; <i>see </i>Section [34-36.1-3.13(b)]. In a “high rise” configuration, however, Section [34-36.1-3.13(a)] contemplates that both will normally be insured by the association (exclusive of improvements and betterments in individual units) and that the cost of such insurance will be a common expense. That common expense may be allocated, however, on the basis of risk if the declaration so requires. <i>See </i>Section [34-36.1-3.15(c)(3)].</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Subsection (b) does not totally invalidate the rule against perpetuities as applied to condominiums. The language does provide that the rule against perpetuities is ineffective as to documents which would govern the condominium during the entire life of the project, regardless of how long that should be. With respect to deeds or devises of units, however, the policies underlying the rule against perpetuities continue to have validity and remain applicable under this Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. In considering the effect of failures to comply with this Act on title matters, subsection (d) refers only to defects in the declaration — which includes the plats and plans — because the declaration is the instrument which creates and defines the units and common elements. No reference is made to other instruments, such as bylaws, because these instruments have no impact on title, whether or not recorded. However, in all cases of violations of the Act, a failure of the bylaws — or any other instrument — to comply with the Act, would entitle any affected persons to appropriate relief under Section [34-36.1-4.17].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. No special prohibition against racial or other forms of discrimination is included in this Act because the provisions of generally applicable federal and state law apply as much to condominiums as to other forms of real estate.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Some examples may help to clarify what sorts of defects in the declaration are to be regarded as “insubstantial” within the meaning of the first sentence of subsection (d).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Suppose the declaration allocates common element interests to all the units, but fails to indicate the formula for the allocation as required by Section [34-36.1-2.07]. This would be a substantial defect if the assigned interests were unequal, but if all units were assigned identical interests it would be possible to infer that the basis of allocation was equality — and the failure of the declaration to say so would be an insubstantial defect. Were this to happen in a condominium where the right to add new units is reserved, however, it should be noted that a subsequent amendment to the declaration adding new units could not use any formula other than equality for reallocating the common element interests unless a different formula were specified pursuant to Section [34-36.1-2.07(b)].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Other examples of insubstantial defects that might occur include failure of the declaration to include the word “condominium” in the name of the project, as required by Section [34-36.1-2.05(a)(1)], or failure of the plats and plans to comply satisfactorily with the requirement of Section [34-36.1-2.09(a)] that they be “clear and legible,” so long as they can at least be deciphered by persons with proper expertise. Failure to organize the unit owners’ association at the time specified in Section [34-36.1-3.01] would not be a defect in the declaration at all, and would not affect the validity or marketability of titles in the condominium. It would, however, be a violation of this Act, and create a claim for relief under Section [34-36.1-4.17].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Each state has case or statutory law dealing with marketability of titles, and the question of whether substantial failures of the declaration to comply with the Act affect marketability of title should be determined by that law and not by this Act.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Many statutes and other regulatory schemes in the multi-owner project field do not separate the functions of a recorded declaration and unrecorded public offering statements or disclosure documents. As a result, many of the developer’s representations and assurances concerning his future plans must appear in the declaration as well as the public offering statement, even though they may have nothing to do with the legal structure or title of the project. <i>See </i>e.g., Section 47-70, Conn.Gen.Stat. (1980). This results in duplicative requirements and unnecessarily complex declarations.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This Act seeks functionally to distinguish between the declaration and the public offering statement. It requires the declaration to contain only those matters which affect the legal structure or title of the condominium. This includes the reserved powers of the declarant to exercise development rights within the condominium. A narrative description of those rights, however, and the possible consequences flowing from their exercise, are required to be disclosed only in the public offering statement and not in the declaration.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. This section requires a statement of the name of the association for the condominium as well as the name of the condominium itself, in order that the declaration may be indexed in the name of the association. <i>See </i>Section [34-36.1-2.01].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. The Act requires that the declaration for a condominium situated in two or more recording districts be recorded in each of those districts. [Enacting Instruction].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Paragraph (a)(5) requires the declarant to state the largest number of units he reserves the right to build. Unlike many current condominium statutes, this Act imposes no time limit, measured by an absolute number of years, at the expiration of which the declarant must relinquish control of the association. Instead, declarant control ends when 75% of the maximum number of units which may be created by the declarant have been sold, or at the end of a 2-year period during which development is not proceeding. <i>See </i>Section [34-36.1-3.03(d)]. The flexibility afforded by this section may be important to a declarant as he responds to unanticipated future changes in his market.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In theory, a declarant might overstate the maximum number of units in an attempt to artificially extend the period of declarant control, since the time might never come when a declarant had sold 75% of that number of units. As a practical matter, however, such a practice would not likely achieve long-term control.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Paragraph (a)(5) requires that the boundaries of each unit created by the declaration be identified. The words “created by the declaration” emphasize that in an expandable project, new units may be created in the future by amendments to the declaration. Until those new units are actually added to the project by amending the declaration, however, they are not units within the meaning of that defined term, and they need not be described.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Section [34-36.1-2.02] makes it possible in many projects to satisfy paragraph (a)(5) of this section by merely providing the identifying number of the units and stating that each unit is bounded by its ceiling, floor, and walls. The plats and plans will show where those ceilings, floors, and perimetric walls are located, and Section [34-36.1-2.02] provides all other details, except to the extent the declaration may make additional or contradictory specifications because of the unique nature of the project.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. Paragraph (a)(6) makes clear that the limited common elements described in Section [34-36.1-2.02(2) and (4)] need not be described in the declaration. These limited common elements are typically porches, balconies, patios, or other amenities which may be included in a project. Such improvements are treated by the Act as limited common elements, rather than either common elements or parts of units, in order to minimize the attention which the documents need to give them, and to secure the result that would be desired in the usual case. Thus, if these improvements remain limited common elements, and no special provisions concerning them are included in the declaration, they may be used only by the units to which they are physically attached; maintenance of those improvements must be paid for by the association; and such improvements need not be specially referred to in the declaration. Porches, balconies and patios must be shown on the plats and plans (<i>see </i>Section [34-36.1-2.09(b)(10)]), but other limited common elements described in Section [34-36.1-2.02(2) and (4)] need not be shown.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>8. Paragraph (a)(7) contemplates that the common elements in the project may be allocated as limited common elements at some future time, either by the declarant or the association. For example, a swimming pool might serve an entire project during early phases of development. At the outset, that pool might be a common element which all the unit owners may use. At a later time, with more units and additional pools built in subsequent phases, either the declarant or the association might determine that the first pool should become a limited common element reserved for the use only of units in the first phase, while the other pools should be reserved exclusively for units in the subsequent phases. Such a potential allocation should be described in the declaration pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>9. Paragraph (a)(8) requires the declaration to describe all development rights and other special declarant rights which the declarant reserves. The declaration must describe the real estate to which each right applies, and state the time limit within which each of those rights must be exercised. The Act imposes no maximum time limit for the exercise of those rights, and the particular language of a declaration will vary from project to project depending on the requirements of each project. This Act contemplates that those rights may be exercised after the period of declarant control terminates.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>10. Plats and plans are made a part of the declaration for legal purposes by Section [34-36.1-2.10], and their content may in part provide some of the information required by this section.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>11. Paragraph (a)(14) is a cross-reference to other sections of the Act which require the declaration to contain particular matters. Some of these sections, such as [34-36.1-2.07] on the allocations of allocated interests or [34-36.1-2.09] on plats and plans, will affect all projects. Others, such as [34-36.1-2.06] on leasehold condominiums, will apply only to particular kinds of projects.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>12. Subsection (b) contemplates that, in addition to the content required by subsection (a), other matters may also be included in the declaration if the declarant or lender feel they are appropriate to the particular project. In particular, the draftsman should carefully consider any desired provisions which would vary any of the many sections of the Act where variation is permitted, including such matters as expanding or restricting the association’s powers. A list of sections which may be varied appears in the comment to Section [34-36.1-1.04].</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Subsection (a) requires that the lessor of any lease, which upon termination will terminate the condominium or reduce its size, must sign the declaration. This requirement insures that the lessor has consented to use of his land as a condominium.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. [Enacting Instructions].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. This section sets out requirements concerning leasehold condominiums which are not typically contained in the statutes of most states. In particular, it requires that the declaration describe the rights of the unit owners, or state that they have no rights concerning a variety of significant matters. The section also contains a number of other consumer protection provisions. However, in contrast to the result under some states’ laws, unit owners have no statutory right to renewal of a lease upon termination.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. The most significant matter of consumer protection in this section is subsection (b), which provides that unit owners who pay their share of the rent of the underlying lease may not be deprived of their enjoyment of the leasehold premises.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (b) is intended to protect the “unit owner” regardless of whether he is a lessee, sublessee, or even further down in a chain of transfer of leasehold interests. Thus, for example, if the “unit owner” is a sublessee, the term “lessor (or) his successor in interest” includes not only the lessor, but also the lessee.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Most existing condominium statutes require a single common basis, usually related to the “value” of the units, to be used in the allocation of common element interests, votes in the association, and common expense liabilities. This Act departs radically from such requirements by permitting each of these allocations to be made on different bases, and by permitting allocations which are unrelated to value.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Thus, all three allocations might be made equally among all units, or in proportion to the relative size of each unit, or on the basis of any other formula the declarant may select, regardless of the values of those units. Moreover, “size” might be used, for example, in allocating common expenses and common element interests, while equality is used in allocating votes in the association. This section does not require that the formulas used by the declarant be justified, but it does require that the formulas be explained. The sole restriction on the formulas to be used in these allocations is that they not discriminate in favor of the units owned by the declarant. Otherwise, each of the separate allocations may be made on any basis which the declarant chooses, and none of the allocations need be tied to any other allocation.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. While the flexibility permitted in allocations is broader than that permitted by any present statutes, it is likely that the traditional bases for allocation will continue to be used, and that the allocations for all allocated interests will often be based on the same formulas. Most commonly, those bases include size, equality, or value of units. Each of these is discussed below.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. If size is chosen as a basis of allocation, the declarant must choose between reliance on area or volume, and the choice must be indicated in the declaration. The declarant might further refine the formula by, for example, excluding unheated areas from the calculation or by partially discounting such areas by means of a ratio. Again, the declarant must indicate the choices he has made and explain the formulas he has chosen.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Most existing condominium statutes require that “value” be used as the basis of all allocations. Under this Act a declarant is free to select such a basis if he wishes to do so. For example, he might designate the “par value” of each unit as a stated number of dollars or points. However, the formula used to develop the par values of the various units would have to be explained in the declaration. For example, the declaration for a high-rise condominium might disclose that the par value of each unit is based on the relative area of each unit on the lower floors, but increases by specified percentages at designated higher levels. The formula for determining area in this example could be further refined in the manner suggested in Comment 2, above, and any other factors (such as the direction in which a unit faces) could also be given weight so long as the weight given to each factor is explained in the declaration.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. The purpose of subsection (b) is to afford some advance disclosure to purchasers of units in the first phase of a flexible condominium of how common element interests, votes and common expense liabilities will be reallocated if additional units are added.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Subsection (e) means what it says when it states that a lien or encumbrance on a common element interest without the unit to which that common element interest is allocated is void. Thus, consider the case of a flexible condominium in which there are 50 units in the first phase, each of which initially has a 2 percent undivided interest in the common elements. The declarant borrows money by mortgaging additional real estate. When the declarant expands the condominium by adding phase 2 containing an additional 50 units, he reallocates the common element interests in the manner described in his original declaration, to give each of the 100 units a 1 percent undivided interest in the common elements in both phases of the condominium. At this point, the construction lender cannot have a lien on the undivided interest of phase 1 owners in the common elements of phase 2 because of the wording of the statute. Thus, the most that the construction lender can have is a lien on the phase 2 units together with their common element interests. The mortgage documents may be written to reflect the fact that upon the addition of phase 2 of the condominium, the lien on the additional real estate will be converted into a lien on the phase 2 units and on the common element interest as they pertain to those units in both phase 1 and phase 2; however, <i>see </i>Comment to Section [34-36.1-2.10].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unless the lender also requires phase 2 to be designated as withdrawable real estate, the phase 2 portion may not be foreclosed upon other than as condominium units and the construction lender may not dispose of phase 2 other than as units which are a part of the condominium. In the event that phase 2 is designated as withdrawable land, then the construction lender may force withdrawal of phase 2 and dispose of it as he wishes, subject to the provisions of the declaration. If one unit in phase 2, however, has been sold to anyone other than the declarant, then phase 2 ceases to be withdrawable land by operation of Section [34-36.1-2.10(d)(2)].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. If a unit owned only by the declarant — as opposed to the same unit if owned by another person — may be subdivided into 2 or more units but cannot be converted in whole or in part into common elements, it is still a unit that may be subdivided or converted into 2 or more units or common elements, within the meaning of the definition of development rights, and is not governed by Section [34-36.1-2.13] (Subdivision of Units).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>8. Subsection (c) represents a significant departure from practice in most states concerning the allocation of votes. The usual rule is that a single allocation of votes is made to each unit, and that allocation applies to all matters on which those votes may be cast. This section recognizes that the increasingly complex nature of some projects requires different allocation on particular questions. It may be appropriate, for example, in a project where common expense liabilities, or questions concerning rules and regulations, affect different units differently.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>9. This section recognizes that there may be certain instances in which class voting in the association would be desirable. For example, in a mixed-use condominium consisting of both residential and commercial units, there may be certain kinds of issues upon which the residential or commercial unit owners should have a special voice, and the device described in Comment 9 was not desired. To prevent abuse of class voting by the declarant, subsection (c) permits class voting only with respect to specified issues directly affecting the designated class and only insofar as necessary to protect valid interests of the designated class.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>10. The last clause of subsection (c) prohibits a practice common in the planned community or other non-condominium multi-ownership projects, where units owned by declarant constitute a separate class of units for voting and other purposes. Upon transfer of title, those units lose these more favorable voting rights. This section makes clear that the votes and other attributes of ownership of a unit may not change by virtue of the identity of the owner. In those circumstances which such classes were legitimately intended to address, principally control of the association, the Act provides other, more balanced devices for declarant control. <i>See </i>Section [34-36.1-3.03(d)].</p>

<p class="p5">Annotations</p>
<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Like all other common elements, limited common elements are owned in common by all unit owners. The use of a limited common element, however, is reserved to less than all of the unit owners. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, the association is responsible for the upkeep of a limited common element and the cost of such upkeep is assessed against all the units. <i>See </i>Sections [34-36.1-3.07(a)] and [34-36.1-3.15(c)(1)]. This might include the costs of repainting all shutters, or balconies, for example, which are limited common elements pursuant to Section [34-36.1-2.02(4)]. Accordingly, there may be occasions where, to meet the expectations of owners and to have costs borne directly by those who benefit from those amenities, the declaration might provide that the costs will be borne, not by all unit owners as part of their common expense assessments, but only by the owners to which the limited common elements are assigned.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Even common elements which are not “limited” within the meaning of this Act may nevertheless be restricted by the unit owners’ association pursuant to the powers set forth in Section [34-36.1-3.02(6) and (10)], unless that power is limited in the declaration. For example, the association might assign reserved parking spaces to designated unit owners, or even to persons who are not unit owners. Such a parking space would differ from a limited common element in that its use would be merely a personal right of the person to whom it is assigned and this section would not have to be complied with to allocate it or to reallocate it.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Because a mortgage or deed of trust may restrict the borrower’s right to transfer the use of a limited common element without the lender’s consent, the terms of the encumbrance should be examined to determine whether the lender’s consent or release is needed to transfer that right of use to another person.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>History of Section.</b> <br>
P.L. 1982, ch. 329, § 2.</p>
<p class="p5">Annotations</p>
<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. The terms “plat” or “plan” have been given a variety of meanings by custom and usage in the various jurisdictions. Under this Act, it is important to recognize that a “plat” need not mean a “survey” of the entire real estate constituting a project at the time the initial plat is recorded, although, through amendments to the plat as development proceeds, it ultimately becomes a survey of the entire project.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As to “plan,” the Act does not use that term to mean the actual building plans used for construction of the project. Instead, the required content of the plans in this Act is described in subsection (d). Essentially, the plans constitute a boundary survey of each unit. Typically, the walls will be the vertical (“up and down” or “perimetric”) boundaries, and the floors and ceilings will be the horizontal boundaries. Importantly, these boundaries need not be physically measured, but may instead be projected from the plat or from actual building construction plans. Thus, the plans under this Act are not conceived to be “as built” plans.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Subsection (c) permits, but does not require, the plats to show the location of contemplated improvements. Since construction of contemplated improvements by a declarant involves the exercise of development rights, a declarant may not create any improvement within real estate where no development rights have been reserved, unless the plats actually show that proposed improvement or unless the association (which the declarant may control) makes the improvement pursuant to Section [34-36.1-3.02(7)]. Should the association attempt that improvement, in the face of unit owner’s objections, it may involve risk of challenge. Within land subject to development rights, of course, construction may take place in accordance with the reserved rights, even if no contemplated improvements are shown on the plats. As to the declarant’s obligation to complete an improvement that is shown, <i>see </i>Section [34-36.1-4.19(a)].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. As noted in the Comments to Section [34-36.1-2.01], a condominium unit may consist of unenclosed ground and/or airspace, with no “building” involved. If this were true of all units in a particular condominium, the provisions of Section [34-36.1-2.09] relating to plans (but not plats) would be inapplicable.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. In detailing the required contents of the plats, two different types of legal description are contemplated. First, in subsection (b)(1), the plat must show at least a general schematic map of the entire project. While this may be by survey, the Act recognizes that a survey may be unduly expensive or impractical in a large project, and accordingly permits a general schematic map of the entire project at the commencement of development. With respect to those portions of the project, however, where no future development may take place, the flexibility of a general schematic map is not necessary. At the same time, it becomes important for title purposes to be able to identify precisely that portion of the project which is essentially completed. Accordingly, as development ceases in particular phases, subsection (b)(2) contemplates that the locations and dimensions of that real estate will be identified. As this process continues, all of the real estate originally shown in a general schematic map will have been surveyed, and the location and dimensions of that real estate identified, at the expiration of development rights. In addition, subsection (2) contemplates that existing improvements must be shown within real estate where no further development will take place. This does not mean the units which may be within each building, but it does mean the external physical dimensions of the buildings themselves. As implied by subsection (11), the nature of “existing improvements” required to be surveyed under subsection (2) should be determined by local practices in the particular state.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Subsection (b)(3) requires that the real estate which is subject to development rights must be identified with a legally sufficient description, that is, either a metes and bounds description, or reference to the deeds of that real estate. Since different portions of the real estate may be subject to differing development rights — for example, only a portion of the total real estate may be added as well as withdrawn from the project — the plan must identify the rights applicable to each portion of that real estate. The same reasoning applies to the legally sufficient description of easements affecting the condominium and any leasehold real estate.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Subsection (f) describes the amendments to the plats and plans which must be made as development rights are exercised. This section requires that the plats and plans be amended at each stage of development to reflect actual progress to date. If an original schematic map was initially recorded as required by subsection (b)(1), the survey required by (b)(2) would also constitute the amendments required by subsection (f).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. The terms “horizontal” and “vertical” are now commonly understood in condominium parlance to refer, respectively, to “upper and lower” and “lateral or perimetric.” Thus, Section [34-36.1-2.02] contemplates that the perimetric walls may be designated as the “vertical” boundaries of a unit and the floor and ceiling as its “horizontal” boundaries. That is the sense in which the words “horizontal” and “vertical” are to be understood in this section and throughout this Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>8. Sections [34-36.1-4.18] and [34-36.1- 4.19] reveal the effect of labeling an improvement “MUST BE BUILT” or “NEED NOT BE BUILT,” as required by subsection (b)(3).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This section generally describes the method by which any development right may be exercised. Importantly, while new development rights may be reserved within new real estate which is added to the condominium, the original time limits on the exercise of these rights which the declarant must include in the original declaration may not be extended. Thus, the development process may continue only within the self-determined constraints originally described by the declarant.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. The reservation and exercise of development rights is and must be closely co-ordinated with financing for the project. As a result, lender review and control of that process is common, and the financing documents should reflect the proposed development process.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A typical construction loan mortgage on a portion of a phased condominium might provide that as soon as new units are built on new land to be added (or, if the portion is also designated withdrawable land, as soon thereafter as anyone other than the declarant becomes the unit owner of a unit in the withdrawable land) the mortgage on that land converts into a mortgage on all of the units located within that portion, together with their respective common element interests. The common element interest of those units will, of course, extend to the common elements in other sections of the condominium. However, failure of a construction loan mortgage to so provide is inconsequential, because conveyance of the units in that phase to the lender or to a purchaser at a foreclosure sale would automatically transfer all of those units’ common element interests, as a result of the requirements of Sections [34-36.1-2.07(d)] and [34-36.1-2.07(a)].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. A lender who holds a mortgage lien on one portion of a condominium may not cause that portion to be withdrawn from the condominium unless the portion constitutes withdrawable real estate in which there is no unit owner other than the declarant. Even then, the amendment effectuating the withdrawal must be executed by the declarant. Consequently, unless the lender wishes to become a declarant subsequent to foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure in order to execute the amendment, or forecloses in order to require an amendment from the association under Section [34-36.1-2.18(i)], a lender might require that the signed amendment be deposited in escrow at the time the loan is made in order to protect against a recalcitrant borrower.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. As indicated in the Comments to Sections [34-36.1-1.03(24)] and [34-36.1-1.06], the withdrawal of real estate from a condominium may constitute a subdivision of land under the applicable subdivision ordinance. Under most subdivision ordinances, the owner of the real estate is regarded as the “subdivider.” In the event of a withdrawal under this section, however, the declarant is in fact the subdivider because of his unique interest in and control over the real estate, even though the real estate, for title purposes, is a common element until withdrawn. Accordingly, he would bear the cost of compliance with any subdivision ordinance required to withdraw a part of the real estate from the condominium.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Subsection (c) deals with special problems surrounding allocated interests when the declarant subdivides or converts units which were originally created in the declaration into additional units, common elements or both. This development right permits the declarant to defer a final decision as to the size of certain units by permitting the subdivision of larger interior spaces into smaller units. The declarant may thus “build to suit” for purchasers’ needs or to meet changing market demand. The concept is called “convertible space” in several existing state statutes.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>For example, a declarant of a 5-story office building condominium may have purchasers committed at the time of the filing of the condominium declaration but a lack of purchasers for the upper 2 floors. In such a circumstance, the declarant could designate the upper 2 floors as a unit, reserving to himself the right to subdivide or convert that unit into additional units, common elements or a combination of units and common elements as needed to suit the requirements of ultimate purchasers.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If, at a later time, a purchaser wishes to purchase half of one floor as unit, the declarant could exercise the development right to subdivide his 2-floor unit into 2 or more units. He may also wish to reserve a portion of the divided floor as a corridor which will constitute common elements. In that case, he would proceed pursuant to this subsection to reallocate the allocated interests among the units in the manner described in this section.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Alternatively, the declarant may ultimately decide that the entire 2 floors should be turned over to the unit owners’ association not as a unit but as common elements to be used perhaps as a cafeteria serving the balance of the building, or for retail space to be rented by the association. In that case, should he choose to make the entire 2 floors common elements, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) would apply.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This section deals with permissible alterations of the interior of a unit, and impermissible alterations of the exterior of a unit and the common elements, in ways which reflect common practice. The stated rules, of course, may be varied by the declaration where desired.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Subsection (3) deals in a unique manner with the problem of creating access between adjoining units owned by the same person. The subsection provides a specific rule which would permit a door, stairwell, or removal of a partition wall between those units, so long as structural integrity is not impaired. That alteration would not be an alteration of boundaries, but would be an exception to the basic rule stated in subsection (2).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. In considering permissible alteration of the interior of a unit, an example may be useful. A nail driven by a unit owner to hang a picture might enter a portion of the wall designated as part of the common elements, but this section would not be violated because structural integrity would not be impaired. Moreover, no trespass would be committed because each unit owner, as a part owner of the common elements, has a right to utilize them subject only to such restrictions as may be created by the Act, the declaration, bylaws, and the unit owners’ association pursuant to Section [34-36.1-3.02].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Removal of a partition or the creation of an aperture between adjoining units would permit the units to be used as one, but they would not become one unit. They would continue to be separate units within the meaning of Section [34-36.1-1.04] and would continue to be treated separately for the purposes of this Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. In addition to the restrictions placed on unit owners by this section, the declaration or bylaws may restrict a unit owner from altering the interior appearance of his unit. Although this might be an undue restriction if imposed upon the primary residence of a unit owner, it may be appropriate in the case of time-share or other condominiums.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This section provides for subdivision of units by unit owners, thereby creating more and smaller units than were originally created. The underlying policy of this section is that the original development plan of the project must be followed, and the expectations of unit owners realized.

A subdivision itself is accomplished by an amendment to the declaration.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. At the same time, situations will often occur where future subdivision is appropriate, and this section permits the declaration to provide for it. Most state statutes do not presently provide for subdivision of units.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The easement approach of Alternative A creates easements for whatever discrepancies may arise, while the “monuments as boundaries” approach of Alternative B would make the title lines move to follow movement of the physical boundaries caused by such discrepancies or subsequent settling or shifting.</p>

<p class="p6">A declarant may maintain sales offices, management offices, and models in units or on common elements in the condominium only if the declaration so provides and specifies the rights of a declarant with regard to the number, size, location, and relocation thereof. Any sales office, management office, or model not designated a unit by the declaration is a common element, and if a declarant ceases to be a unit owner, he or she ceases to have any rights with regard thereto unless it is removed promptly from the condominium in accordance with a right to remove reserved in the declaration.

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This section prescribes the circumstances under which portions of the condominium — either units or common elements — may be used for sales offices, management offices, or models. The basic requirement is that the declarant must describe his rights to maintain such offices in the declaration. There are no limitations on that right, so that either units owned by the declarant or other persons, or the common elements themselves, may be used for that purpose. Typical common element uses might include a sales booth in the lobby of the building, or a trailer or temporary building located outside the buildings on the grounds of the property.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. In addition, this section contains a permissive provision permitting advertising on the common elements. The declarant may choose to limit his rights in terms of the size, location, or other matters affecting the advertising. The Act, however, imposes no limitation. At the same time, the last sentence of the section recognizes that state or local zoning or other laws may limit advertising, both in terms of size and content of the advertising, or the use of the units or common elements for such purposes. This section makes it clear that local law would apply in those cases.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This section grants to declarant an easement across the common elements, subject to any self-imposed restrictions on that easement contained in the declaration. At the same time, the easement is not an easement for all purposes and under all circumstances, but only a grant of such rights as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of exercising the declarant’s rights. Thus, for example, if other access were equally available to the land where new units are being created, which did not require the declarant’s construction equipment to pass and repass over the common elements in a manner which significantly inconvenienced the unit owners, a court might apply the “reasonably necessary” test contained in this section to consider limitations on the declarant’s easement. The rights granted by this section may be enlarged by a specific reservation in the declaration.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain § 34-36.1-1.07, a condominium may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units to which at least eighty percent (80%) of the votes in the association are allocated, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the condominium are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the execution of a termination agreement, or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners. The termination agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every municipality in which a portion of the condominium is situated, and is effective only upon recordation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> In the case of a condominium containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide that all the common elements and units of the condominium shall be sold following termination. If, pursuant to the agreement, any real estate in the condominium is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the minimum terms of the sale.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> In the case of a condominium containing any units not having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide for sale of the common elements, but may not require that the units be sold following termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise or unless all the unit owners consent to the sale.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real estate in the condominium, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). If any real estate in the condominium is to be sold following termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lien holders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided in subsection (h). Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and his or her successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his or her unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and his or her successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this chapter or the declaration.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> If the real estate constituting the condominium is not to be sold following termination, title to the common elements and, in a condominium containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real estate in the condominium, vests in the unit owners upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (h), and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and his or her successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his or her unit.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> Following termination of the condominium, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear. Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the units, which were recorded prior to termination, may enforce those liens in the same manner as any lien holder. All other creditors of the association shall be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately prior to termination.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> The respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections (e), (f), and (g) are as follows:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Except as provided in subdivision (h)(2), the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units, limited common elements, and common elements interests immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within thirty (30) days after distribution by unit owners of units to which a majority of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner’s interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner’s unit and common element interest by the total fair market values of all the units and common elements.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value thereof prior to destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are their respective common element interests immediately before the termination.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> Except as provided in subsection (j), foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire condominium does not of itself terminate the condominium, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the condominium, other than withdrawable real estate, does not withdraw that portion from the condominium. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real estate does not of itself withdraw that real estate from the condominium, but the person taking title thereto has the right to require from the association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the condominium.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(j)</b> If a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real estate comprising the condominium has priority over the declaration, and the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing the lien or encumbrance may upon foreclosure, record an instrument excluding the real estate subject to that lien or encumbrance from the condominium.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. While few condominiums have yet been terminated under present state law, a number of problems are certain to arise upon termination which have not been adequately addressed by most of those statutes. These include such matters as the percentage of unit owners which should be required for termination; the time frame within which written consents from all unit owners must be secured; the manner in which common elements and units should be disposed of following termination, both in the case of sale and non-sale of all of the real estate; the circumstances under which sale of units may be imposed on dissenting owners; the powers held by the Board of Directors on behalf of the association to negotiate a sales agreement; the practical consequences to the project from the time the unit owners approve the termination until the transfer of title and occupancy actually occurs; the impact of termination on liens on the units and common elements; distribution of sales proceeds; the effect of foreclosure or enforcement of liens against the entire condominium with respect to the validity of the project; and other matters.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Recognizing that unanimous consent from all unit owners would be impossible to secure as a practical matter on a project of any size, subsection (a) states a general rule that 80% consent of the unit owners would be required for termination of a project. The declaration may require a larger percentage of the unit owners and, in a non-residential project, it may also require a smaller percentage. Pursuant to Section [34-36.1-2.19] (Rights of Secured Lenders), lenders may require that the declaration specify a larger percentage of unit owner consent or, more typically, will require the consent of a percentage of the lenders before the project may be terminated.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. As a result of subsection (d), unless the declaration requires unanimous consent for termination, the declarant may be able to terminate the condominium despite the unanimous opposition of other unit owners if the declarant owns units to which the requisite number of votes are allocated. Such a result might occur, for example, should a declarant be unable to continue sales in a project where some sales have been made.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Subsection (a) describes the procedure for execution of the termination agreement. It recognizes that not all unit owners will be able to execute the same instrument, and permits execution or ratification of the master termination agreement. Since the transfer of an interest in real estate is being accomplished by the agreements, each of the ratifications must be executed in the same manner as a deed. Importantly, the agreement must specify the time within which it will be effective; otherwise, the project might be indefinitely in “limbo” if ratifications had been signed by some, but not all, required unit owners, and the signing unit owners fail to revoke their agreements. Importantly, the agreement becomes effective only when it is recorded.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Subsections (c) and (d) deal with the question of when all the real estate in the condominium, or the common elements, may be sold without unanimous consent of the unit owners. The section reaches a different result based on the physical configuration of the project.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsection (c) states that if a condominium contains only units having horizontal boundaries — a typical high rise building — the unit owners may be required to sell their units upon termination despite objection. Under subsection (d), however, if the project contains any units which do not have horizontal boundaries — for example, a single family home project where some of the units include title to <i>land </i>and could theoretically continue apart from a condominium as a title matter — then the termination agreement may not force dissenting unit owners to sell their units unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise. Obviously, of course, if all the unit owners consent to the sale of the units, sale of the entire development would be possible.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Subsection (e) describes the powers of the association during the pendency of the termination proceedings. It empowers the association to negotiate for the sale, but makes the validity of any contract dependent on unit owner approval. This section also makes clear that, upon termination, title to the real estate shall be held by the association, so that the association may convey title without the necessity of each unit owner signing the deed. Finally, this section makes clear that, until the association delivers title to the condominium property, the project will continue to operate as it had prior to the termination, thus insuring that the practical necessities of operation of the real estate will not be impaired.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. Subsection (f) contemplates the possibility that a condominium might be terminated but the real estate not sold. While this is not likely to be the usual case, it is important to provide for the possibility.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>8. A complex series of creditors’ rights questions may arise upon termination. Those questions involve competing claims of first mortgage holders on individual units, other secured and unsecured creditors of individual unit owners, judgment creditors of the association, creditors of the association to whom a security interest in the common elements has been granted, and unsecured creditors of the association. Subsection (g) attempts to establish general rules with respect to these competing claims, but leaves to state law the resolution of the priorities of those competing claims.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>9. Subsection (h) departs significantly from the usual result under most condominium acts. Under those acts the proceeds of the sale of the entire project are distributed upon termination to each unit owner in accordance with the common element interest which was allocated at the outset of the project. Of course, in an older development, those original allocations will bear little resemblance to the actual value of the units. For that reason, the Act adopts an appraisal procedure for distribution of the sales proceeds. This appraisal may dramatically affect the amount of dollars actually received by unit owners. Accordingly, it is likely the appraisal will be required to be distributed prior to the time the termination agreement is approved, so that unit owners may understand the likely financial consequences of the termination.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>10. Subsection (h)(2) is an exception to the “fair market value” rule. It provides that, if appraisal of any unit cannot be made, either through pictures or comparison with other units, so that any unit’s appropriate share in the overall proceeds cannot be calculated, then the distribution will fall back on the only objective, albeit artificial, standard available, which is the common element interest allocated to each unit.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>11. Foreclosure of a mortgage or other lien or encumbrance does not automatically terminate the condominium, but, if a mortgagee or other lienholder (or any other party) acquires units with a sufficient number of votes, that party can cause the condominium to be terminated pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>12. A mortgage or deed of trust on a condominium unit may provide for the lien to shift, upon termination, to become a lien on what will then be the borrower’s undivided interest in the whole property. However, such a shift would be deemed to occur even in the absence of express language, pursuant to the first sentence of subsection (d).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>13. With respect to the association’s role as trustee under subsection (c), see Section [34-36.1-3.17].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>14. If an initial appraisal made pursuant to subsection (f) were rejected by vote of the unit owners, the association would be obligated to secure a new appraisal.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>15. “Foreclosure” in subsection (i) includes deeds in lieu of foreclosure, and “liens” includes tax and other liens on real estate which may be converted or withdrawn from the project.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>16. The termination agreement should adopt or contain any restrictions, covenants and other provisions for the governance and operation of the property formerly constituting the condominium which the owners deem appropriate. These might closely parallel the provisions of the declaration and bylaws. This is particularly important in the case of a condominium which is not to be sold pursuant to the terms of the termination agreement. In the absence of such provisions, the general law of the state governing tenancies in common would apply.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>17. Subsection (j) recognizes the possibility that a pre-existing lien might not have been released prior to the time the condominium declaration was recorded. In the absence of a provision such as subsection (j), recordation of the declaration would constitute a changing of the priority of those liens; and it is contrary to all expectations that a prior lienholder may be involuntarily subjected to the condominium documents. For that reason, this section permits the non consenting prior lienholder upon foreclosure to exclude the real estate subject to his lien from the condominium.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. In a number of instances, particularly sale or encumbrance of common elements, or termination of a condominium, a lender’s security may be dramatically affected by acts of the association. For that reason, this section permits ratification of those acts of the association which are specified in that declaration as a condition of their effectiveness.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. There are three important limitations on the rights of lender consent. They are: (1) a prohibition on control over the general administrative affairs of the association; (2) restrictions on control over the association’s powers during litigation or other proceedings; and (3) prohibition of receipt or distribution of insurance proceeds prior to application of those proceeds for rebuilding.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. It is important that lenders not be able to step in and unilaterally act as receiver or trustee of the association. There may, of course, be occasions when a court of competent jurisdiction would order appointment of a receiver for an association. While this would be possible in a court proceeding, the Act prohibits private contractual granting of such a power.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Since it may well be that the association might find itself involved in litigation which would be adverse to the interests of the lender or the declarant, it is inappropriate for a secured party to be able to control the course of litigation in the absence of the consent of the other parties. In an appropriate case, of course, where the lenders’ interests are affected, a lender might seek to intervene as a party in that proceeding.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Section [34-36.1-3.13] provides for the distribution of insurance proceeds in a particular manner. In particular, it prevents distribution of those proceeds to lenders until the intended purpose of the insurance has been met. For that reason, under this section the declaration may not provide the lender a right to receive insurance proceeds in any manner except the manner provided in Section [34-36.1-3.13].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. In addition to the provision of the declaration, the provisions of individual deeds to units may require that unit owner to secure his lender’s consent before taking particular actions.</p>

<p class="p5">Annotations</p>
<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. It is very common in large or multi-phased condominiums, particularly those developed under existing laws, for the declarant to create a master or umbrella association which provides management services or decision-making functions for a series of smaller condominiums. While it is expected that this phenomenon will be less necessary under this Act because of the permissible period of time for declarant control over the project, it is nonetheless possible in larger developments that this form of management will continue. Moreover, this section should be of significant benefit to the larger number of condominiums created under prior law which have need for the benefits of a provision on master associations.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Subsection (a) states the general rule that the powers of a unit owners’ association may only be exercised by, or delegated to, a master association if the declaration for the condominium permits that result. The declaration may have originally provided for a master association; alternatively, the unit owners of several condominiums may amend their declarations in similar fashion to provide for this power. Subsection (a) makes it clear that, if any of the powers of the unit owners’ association may be exercised by, or delegated to, a master association, all other provisions of this Act which apply to a unit owners’ association apply to that master association except as modified by this section. Accordingly, such provisions on notice, voting, quorums, records, meetings, and other matters which apply to the unit owners’ association would apply with equal validity to such a master association.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Subsection (b) changes the usual presumption with respect to the powers of the unit owners’ association, except in those cases where the master association is actually acting as the only association for one or more condominiums. In those cases where it is not so acting, however, the only powers of the unit owners’ association which the master association may exercise are the ones expressly permitted in the declaration or in the delegation of power. This is in significant contrast with the rule of Section [34-36.1-2.02] that all of the powers described in that section may be exercised unless limited by the declaration.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Subsection (c) clarifies the liability of the members of the executive board of a unit owners’ association when the condominium for which the unit owners’ association acts has delegated some of its powers to a master association. In that instance, subsection (c) makes it clear that the members of the executive board of the unit owners’ association have no liability for acts and omissions of the master association board; under subsection (a), that liability lies with the members of the master association.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Subsection (d) addresses the question of the rights and responsibilities of the unit owners in their dealings with the master board. A variety of sections enumerated in subsection (d) provide certain rights and powers to unit owners in their dealings with their association. In the affairs of the master association, however, it would be incongruous for the unit owners to maintain those same rights if those unit owners were not in fact electing the master board. Thus, for example, the question of election of directors, meetings, notice of meetings, quorums, and other matters enumerated in those sections would have little meaning if those sections were read literally when applied to a master board which was not elected by all members of the condominiums subject to the master board. For that reason, the rights of notice, voting, and other rights enumerated in the Act are available only to the persons who actually elect the board.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Subsection (e) recognizes that there may be reasons for a representative form of election of directors of the master association. Alternatively, there may be cases where at-large election is reasonable. For that reason, subsection (e) provides that, after the period of declarant control has terminated, there may be 4 ways of electing the master association board. Those four ways are: (1) at-large election of the master board among all the condominiums subject to the master association; (2) at-large election of the master board only among the members of the executive boards of all condominiums subject to the master association; (3) each condominium might have designated positions on the master board, and those spaces could be filled by an at-large election among all the members of each condominium; or (4) the designated positions could be filled by an election only among the members of the executive board of the unit owners’ association for each condominium. It would only be in the case of an at-large election of the master board among all condominiums that subsection (d) would have no relevance.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Alternatively, the merger or consolidation agreement may state the percentage of overall common element interests, common expense liabilities, and votes in the association allocated to “all of the units comprising each of the pre-existing condominiums.” The agreement might then also provide that the portion of the percentage allocated to each unit from among the shares allocated to each condominium will be equal to the percentage of common expense liability and votes in the association allocated to that unit by the declaration of the preexisting condominium.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This section permits the declaration, subject to the limitations of subsection (b), to include limitations on the exercise of any of the enumerated powers. [Enacting Instructions.]</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Required provisions of the bylaws of the association, referenced in paragraph (1), are set forth in Section [34-36.1-3.06].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Many state condominium statutes give the association the power to sue and be sued in its own name. In the absence of a statutory grant of standing such as that set forth in paragraph (4), some courts have held that the association, because it has no ownership interest in the condominium, has no standing to bring, defend, or to intervene in litigation or administrative proceedings in its own name.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Paragraph (8) refers to the power granted by Section [34-36.1-3.12] to sell or encumber common elements without a termination of the condominium upon a vote of the requisite number of unit owners. Paragraph (9) permits the association to grant easements, leases, licenses, and concessions with respect to the common elements without a vote of the unit owners.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. The powers granted the association in paragraph (11) to impose charges for late payment of assessments and to levy reasonable fines for violations of the association’s rules reflect the need to provide the association with sufficient powers to exercise its “governmental” functions as the ruling body of the condominium community. These powers are intended to be in addition to any rights which the association may have under other law.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Under paragraph (14), the declaration may provide for the assignment of income of the association, including common expense assessment income, as security for, or payment of, debts of the association. The power may be limited in any manner specified in the declaration — for example, the power might be limited to specified purposes such as repair of existing structures, or to income from particular sources such as income from tenants, or to a specified percentage of common expense assessments. The power, in many instances, should help materially in securing credit for the association at favorable interest rates. The inability of associations to borrow because of a lack of assets, in spite of its income stream, has been a significant problem.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. If the association is incorporated, it may, pursuant to paragraph (16), exercise all other powers of a corporation. Similarly, if the association is unincorporated, the association may, by virtue of paragraph (16), exercise all other powers of an unincorporated association. Inconsistent provisions of state corporation or unincorporated association law are subject to the provisions of this Act, as provided in Section [34-36.1-1.08].</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Within thirty (30) days after adoption of any proposed budget for the condominium, the executive board shall provide a summary of the budget to all the unit owners, and shall set a date for a meeting of the unit owners to consider ratification of the budget not less than fourteen (14) nor more than thirty (30) days after mailing of the summary.

P.L. 1982, ch. 329, § 2.</p>
<p class="p5">Annotations</p>
<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Subsection (a) makes members of the executive board appointed by the declarant liable as fiduciaries of the unit owners with respect to their actions or omissions as members of the board. This provision imposes a very high standard of duty because the board is vested with great power over the property interests of unit owners, and because there is a great potential for conflicts of interest between the unit owners and the declarant.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Officers and board members elected by the unit owners are required only to exercise ordinary and reasonable care. This lower standard of care should increase the willingness of unit owners to serve as officers and members of the board.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. The provisions of paragraph (c) permit the unit owners to disapprove any proposed budget, but a rejection of the budget does not result in cessation of assessments until a budget is approved. Rather, assessments continue on the basis of the last approved periodic budget until the new budget is in effect.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Subsections (d) and (e) recognize the practical necessity for the declarant to control the association during the developmental phases of a condominium project. However, any executive board member appointed by the declarant pursuant to subsection (d) is liable as a fiduciary to any unit owner for his acts or omissions in such capacity.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Subsection (d) permits a declarant to surrender his right to appoint and remove officers and executive board members prior to the termination of the period of declarant control in exchange for a veto right over certain actions of the association or its executive board. This provision is designed to encourage transfer of control by declarants to unit owners as early as possible, without impinging upon the declarant’s rights (for the duration of the period of declarant control) to maintain ultimate control of those matters which he may deem particularly important to him. It might be noted that the declarant at all times (even after the expiration of the period of declarant control) is entitled to cast the votes allocated to his units in the same manner as any other unit owner.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Subsection (e), in combination with subsection (d), provides for a gradual transfer of control of the association to the unit owners from the declarant. Such a gradual transfer is preferable to a one-time turnover of control since it assures that the unit owners will be involved, to some extent, in the affairs of the association from a relatively early date and that some unit owners will acquire experience in dealing with association matters.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This section deals with the issue of the extent to which obligations and liabilities imposed upon a declarant by this Act are transferred to a third party by a transfer of the declarant’s interest in a condominium. There are two parts to the problem. First, what obligations and liabilities to unit owners (both existing unit owners and persons who become unit owners in the future) should a declarant retain, notwithstanding his transfer of interests. Second, what obligations and liabilities may fairly be imposed upon the declarant’s successor in interest. No present condominium statute adequately addresses these issues.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. This section strikes a balance between the obvious need to protect the interests of unit owners and the equally important need to protect innocent successors to a declarant’s rights, especially persons such as mortgagees whose only interest in the condominium project is to protect their debt security. The general scheme of the section is to impose upon a declarant continuing obligations and liabilities for promises, acts, or omissions undertaken during the period that he was in control of the condominium, while relieving a declarant who transfers all or part of his special declarant rights in a project of such responsibilities with respect to the promises, acts, or omissions of a successor over whom he has no control. Similarly, the section imposes obligations and liabilities arising after the transfer upon a non-affiliated successor to a declarant’s interests, but absolves such a transferee of responsibility for the promises, acts, or omissions of a transferor declarant over which he had no control. Finally, the section makes special provision for the interests of certain successor declarants (<i>e. g., </i>a mortgagee who succeeds to the rights of the declarant pursuant to a “deed in lieu of foreclosure” and who holds the project solely for transfer to another person) by relieving such persons of virtually all of the obligations and liabilities imposed upon declarants by this Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Subsection (a) provides that a successor in interest to a declarant may acquire the special rights of the declarant only by recording an instrument which reflects a transfer of those rights. This recordation requirement is important to determine the duration of the period of declarant control pursuant to Section [34-36.1-3.03(d) and (e)], as well as to place unit owners on notice of all persons entitled to exercise the special rights of a declarant under this Act. The transfer by a declarant of all of his interest in a condominium project to a successor, without a concomitant transfer of the special rights of a declarant pursuant to this subsection, results in the automatic termination of such special declarant rights and of any period of declarant control.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Under subsection (b), a transferor declarant remains liable to unit owners (both existing unit owners and persons who subsequently become unit owners) for all obligations and liabilities, including warranty obligations on all improvements made by him, arising prior to the transfer. If a declarant transfers any special declarant right to an affiliate (as defined in Section [34-36.1-1.03(1)]), the transferor remains subject to all liabilities specified in paragraph (1) of subsection (b) and, in addition, is jointly and severally liable with his successor in interest for all obligations and liabilities of the successor.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. The obligations and liabilities imposed upon transferee declarants under the Act are set forth in subsection (e). In general, a transferee declarant (other than an affiliate of the original declarant and other than a successor whose interest in the project is solely for the protection of debt security) becomes subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed upon a declarant by the Act or by the declaration with respect to any promises, acts, or omissions undertaken subsequent to the transfer which relate to the rights he holds. Such a transferee is liable for the promises, acts, or omissions of the original declarant undertaken prior to the transfer, except as set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(ii). For example, a successor declarant would not be liable for the warranty obligations of the original declarant with respect to improvements to the project made by the original declarant. Similarly, a successor would not be liable, under normal circumstances, for any misrepresentation or breach of fiduciary duty by the original declarant prior to the transfer. The successor is liable, however, to complete improvements labeled “MUST BE BUILT” on the original plans.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. To preclude declarants from evading their obligations and liabilities under this Act by transferring their interests to affiliated companies, paragraph (1) of subsection (e) makes clear that any successor declarant who is an affiliate of the original declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed upon the original declarant by the Act or by the declaration. Similarly, as previously noted, paragraph (2) of subsection (b) provides that an original declarant who transfers his rights to an affiliate remains jointly and severally liable with his successor for all obligations and liabilities imposed upon declarants by the Act or by the declaration.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. The section handles the problem of certain successor declarants (<i>i. e., </i>persons whose sole interest in the condominium project is the protection of debt security) in three ways. First, subsection (c) provides that, in the case of a foreclosure of a mortgage, a sale by a trustee under a deed of trust, or a sale by a trustee in bankruptcy of any units owned by a declarant, any person acquiring title to all of the units being foreclosed or sold may request the transfer of special declarant rights. In that event, and only upon such request, such rights will be transferred in the instrument conveying title to the units and such transferee will thereafter become a successor declarant subject to the other provisions of this section. In the event of a foreclosure, sale by a trustee under a deed of trust, or sale by a trustee in bankruptcy of <i>all </i>units owned by a declarant, if the transferee of such units does not request the transfer of special declarant rights, then, under subsection (d), such special declarant rights cease to exist and any period of declarant control terminates.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Second, any person who succeeds to special declarant rights as a result of the transfers just described or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, may, pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection (e), declare his intention (in a recorded instrument) to hold those rights solely for transfer to another person. Thereafter, such a successor may transfer all special declarant rights to a third party acquiring title to any units owned by the successor but may not, prior to such transfer, exercise any special declarant rights other than the right to control the executive board of the association in accordance with the provisions of Section [34-36.1-3.03(c)]. A successor declarant who exercises such a right is relieved of any liability under the Act except liability for any acts or omissions related to his control of the executive board of the association. This provision is designed to deal with the typical problem of a foreclosing mortgage lender who opts to bid in and obtain the project at the foreclosure sale solely for the purpose of subsequent resale. It permits such a foreclosing lender to undertake such a transaction without incurring the full burden of declarant obligations and liabilities. At the same time, the provision recognizes the need for continuing operation of the association and, to that end, permits a foreclosing lender to assume control of the association for the purpose of ensuring a smooth transition.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Third, paragraph (3) of subsection (e) provides that a successor who has only the right to maintain model units, sales offices, and signs does not thereby become subject to any obligations or liabilities as a declarant except for the obligation to provide a public offering statement and any liability resulting therefrom. This provision also is designed to protect mortgage lenders and contemplates the situation where a lender takes over a condominium project and desires to sell out existing units without making any additional improvements to the project. This provision facilitates such a transaction by relieving the mortgage lender, in that instance, from the full burden of obligations and liabilities ordinarily imposed upon a declarant under the Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under Section [34-36.1-2.10], a declarant may reserve the right to create additional units in portions of the condominium which were originally designated as common elements. The declarant becomes the owner of any units created, but, prior to creation of units, the title to those portions of the condominium is in the unit owners. The right to create the units is an interest in land in which a security interest might be granted. If the mortgagee of that interest forecloses, the purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the choices concerning development rights and resulting liability which are described in the preceding paragraph. That is, under subsections (c) and (d), the purchaser may limit his liability by agreeing to hold the developments only for the purpose of transfer as provided by paragraph (e)(4) or may buy the rights under paragraph (c).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This section deals with a common problem in the development of condominium projects: the temptation on the part of the developer, while in control of the association, to enter into, on behalf of the association, long-term contracts and leases with himself or with an affiliated entity.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Act deals with this problem in two ways. First, Section [34-36.1-3.03(a)] imposes upon all executive board members appointed by the declarant liability as fiduciaries of the unit owners for all of their acts or omissions as members of the board. Second, Section [34-36.1-3.05] provides for the termination of certain contracts and leases made during a period of declarant control.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. In addition to contracts or leases made by a declarant with himself or with an affiliated entity, there are also certain contracts and leases so critical to the operation of the condominium and to the unit owners’ full enjoyment of their rights of ownership that they too should be voidable by the unit owners upon the expiration of any period of declarant control. At the same time, a statutorily-sanctioned right of cancellation should not be applicable to all contracts or leases which a declarant may enter into in the course of developing a condominium project. For example, a commercial tenant would not be willing to invest substantial amounts in equipment and other improvements for the operation of his business if the lease could unilaterally be cancelled by the association. Accordingly, this section provides that (subject to the exception set forth in the last sentence thereof), upon the expiration of any period of declarant control, the association may terminate without penalty, any “critical” contract (<i>i.e., </i>any management contract, employment contract, or lease of recreational or parking areas or facilities) entered into during a period of declarant control, any contract or lease to which the declarant or an affiliate of the declarant is a party, or any contract or lease previously entered into by the declarant which is not <i>bona fide </i>or which was unconscionable to the unit owners at the time entered into under the circumstances then prevailing.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. The last sentence of the section addresses the usual leasehold condominium situation where the underlying real estate is subject to a long-term ground lease which is then submitted to the Act. Because termination of the ground lease would terminate the condominium, this sentence prevents cancellation. However, in order to avoid the possibility that recreation and other leases otherwise cancellable under subsection (a) will be restructured to come within the exception, a subjective test of “intent” is imposed. Under the test, if a declarant’s principal purpose in subjecting the leased real estate to the condominium was to prevent termination of the lease, the lease may nevertheless be terminated.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Because the Act does not require the recordation of bylaws, it is contemplated that unrecorded bylaws will set forth only matters relating to the internal operations of the association and various “housekeeping” matters with respect to the condominium.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. The Act permits the declaration to separate maintenance responsibility from ownership. This is commonly done in practice. In the absence of any provision in the declaration, maintenance responsibility follows ownership of the unit or rests with the association in the case of common elements. Under this Act, limited common elements (which might include, for example, patios, balconies, and parking spaces) are common elements. <i>See </i>Section [34-36.1-1.03(16)]. As a result, under subsection (a), unless the declaration requires that unit owners are responsible for the upkeep of such limited common elements, the association will be responsible for their maintenance. Under Section [34-36.1-3.15(c)], the cost of maintenance, repair, and replacement for such limited common elements is assessed against all the units in the condominium, unless the declaration provides for such expenses to be paid only by the units <i>benefited. See </i>Comment 1 to Section [34-36.1-2.08].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Under Section [34-36.1-2.10], a declarant may reserve the right to create units in portions of the condominium originally designated as common elements. Prior to creation of the units, title to those portions of the condominium is in the unit owners. However, under Section [34-36.1-3.07(b)], the developer is obligated to pay all of the expenses of (including real estate taxes properly apportionable to) that real estate.

If the wrong occurred during any period of declarant control and the association gives the declarant reasonable notice of and an opportunity to defend against the action, the declarant who then controlled the association is liable to the association or to any unit owner: (1) for all tort losses not covered by insurance suffered by the association or that unit owner, and (2) for all costs which the association would not have incurred but for a breach of contract or other wrongful act or omission. Whenever the declarant is liable to the association under this section, the declarant is also liable for all litigation expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by the association. Any statute of limitation affecting the association’s right of action under this section is tolled until the period of declarant control terminates. A unit owner is not precluded from bringing an action contemplated by this section because he or she is a unit owner or a member or officer of the association.

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This section provides that any action in tort or contract arising out of acts or omissions of the association shall be brought against the association and not against the individual unit owners. This changes the law in states where plaintiffs are forced to name individual unit owners as the real parties in interest to any action brought against the association. The subsection also provides that a unit owner is not precluded from bringing an action in tort or contract against the association solely because he is a unit owner or a member or officer of the association.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. In recognition of the practical control that can (and in most cases will) be exercised by a declarant over the affairs of the association during any period of declarant control permitted pursuant to Section [34-36.1-3.03], subsection (a) provides that the association or any unit owner shall have a right of action against the declarant for any losses (including both payment of damages and attorneys’ fees) suffered by the association or any unit owner as a result of an action based upon a tort or breach of contract arising during any period of declarant control. To assure that the decision to bring such an action can be made by an executive board free from the influence of the declarant, the subsection also provides that any statute of limitations affecting such a right of action by the association shall be tolled until the expiration of any period of declarant control.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. If a suit based on a claim which accrued during the period of developer control is brought against the association after control of the association has passed from the developer, reasonable notice to, and grant of an opportunity to the developer to defend, are conditions to developer liability. If, however, suit is brought against the association while the developer is still in control, obviously the developer cannot later resist a suit by the association for reimbursement on the grounds of failure to notify.</p>

<p class="p5">Annotations</p>
<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Subsection (a) provides that, on agreement of unit owners holding 80% of the votes in the association, parts of the common elements may be sold or encumbered. (80% is the percentage required for termination of the condominium under Section [34-36.1-2.18].) This power may be exercised during the period of declarant control, but, in order to be effective, 80% of non-declarant unit owners must approve the action.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The ability to sell a portion of the common elements without termination of the condominium gives the condominium regime desirable flexibility. For example, the unit owners, some years after the initial creation of the condominium, may decide to convey away a portion of the open space which has been reserved as a part of the common elements because they no longer find the area useful or because they wish to use sale proceeds to make other improvements. Similarly, the ability to encumber common elements gives the association power to raise money for improvements through the device of mortgaging the improvements themselves. Of course, recreational improvements will frequently not be sufficient security for a loan for their construction. Nevertheless, the ability to take a security interest in such improvements may lead lenders to be more favorably disposed toward making a loan in larger amounts and at lower interest rates.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Subsection (b) requires that the agreement for sale or encumbrance be evidenced by the execution of an agreement in the same manner as a deed by the requisite majority of the unit owners. The agreement then must be recorded in the land records. The recorded agreement signed by the unit owners is not the conveyance itself, but is rather a supporting document which shows that the association has full power to execute a deed or mortgage. Under subsection (c), it is contemplated that the association will execute the actual instrument of conveyance. Under subsection (e), a conveyance or encumbrance of common elements may not deprive a unit owner of rights of access and support.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Under the condominium form of ownership, each unit owner owns a share of the common elements as an appurtenant interest to his unit and, when the unit owner mortgages his unit, he also mortgages his appurtenant interest. The unit owner himself cannot convey his unit separately from its interest in the common elements nor can he convey his common element interest separately from the unit. Therefore, if there is a mortgage or other lien against any unit, the problem arises as to whether the association under this section can convey a part of the common elements free from the mortgage interest of the unit mortgagee. Subsection (f) answers that question <i>no. </i>Therefore, a sale or encumbrance of common elements under this section would be subject to the superior priority of any prior mortgagee on the unit unless the mortgagee releases his interest therein.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The introductory language is intended to permit the declaration to vary the rule of subsection (f). The declaration might provide, for example, that any subsequent conveyance of specified portions of the common elements would be free of prior security interests. In that case, the security interest in the common elements held by unit mortgagees would be cut off. Since the loss of the security interest in the common elements could significantly affect mortgagees, states considering inclusion of the bracketed language probably should consult mortgagee groups. If limited to particular common element real estate such as portions of recreational area land, and if protections are provided for lender interests, the ability to convey free of prior security interests could contribute significantly to the continued economic viability of a project.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The declaration could protect lender interests in connection with a conveyance free of the security interests in a number of ways. For example, the declaration might provide for payment of a specified percentage of the sales price to unit mortgagees or it might provide that a specified percentage of the mortgage debt be paid to them. Also, the declaration might provide that no sale or encumbrance of common elements would be effective without the approval of a specified percentage of lenders. There are, no doubt, other devices which could afford substantial protection to lenders.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> In the case of a building containing units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, the insurance maintained under subdivision (a)(1), to the extent reasonably available, shall include the units, but need not include improvements and betterments installed by unit owners.</p>

The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for unit owners and lien holders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of subsection (h), the proceeds must be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged property, and unit owners and lien holders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completed, repaired or restored, or the condominium is terminated.</p>

The cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves is a common expense. If the entire condominium is not repaired or replaced, (1) the insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements must be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the condominium; (2) the insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited, common elements that are not rebuilt must be distributed to the owners of those units and the owners of the units to which those limited common elements were allocated, or to lienholders, as their interests may appear; and (3) the remainder of the proceeds must be distributed to all the unit owners or lienholders, as their interests may appear, in proportion to the common element interests of all the units. If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit’s allocated interests are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under § 34-36.1-1.07(a) and the association promptly shall prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations.

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Subsections (a) and (b) provide that the required insurance must be maintained only to the extent reasonably available. This permits the association to comply with the insurance requirements even if certain coverages are unavailable or unreasonably expensive.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Subsection (b) represents a significant departure from the present law in virtually all states by requiring that the association obtain and maintain property insurance on <i>both </i>the common elements <i>and </i>the units within buildings with “stacked” units. <i>See </i>Comment 3. While it has been common practice in many parts of the country (either by custom or as mandated by statute) for associations to maintain property insurance on the common elements, it has generally not been the practice for the property insurance policy to cover individual units as well. However, given the great interdependence of the unit owners in the stacked unit condominium situation, mandating property insurance for the entire building is the preferable approach. Moreover, such an approach will greatly simplify claims procedures, particularly where both common elements and portions of a unit have been destroyed. If common elements and units are insured separately, the insurers could be involved in disputes as to the coverage provided by each policy.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Act does not mandate association insurance on units in town house or other arrangements in which there are no stacked units. However, if the developer wishes, the declaration may require association insurance as to units having shared walls or as to all units in the development. Many developments will have some units with horizontal boundaries and other units with no horizontal boundaries. In that case, association insurance as to the units having horizontal boundaries is required, but it is not necessary as to other units.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. The distinction between what is a common element and what is a unit with respect to the insurance coverage required by this section is complex. The definitions of common elements and a unit in Section [34-36.1-1.03(4) and (28)] are not sufficient for this purpose. To determine the distinction between the common elements and units, one must refer first to the declaration’s section on unit boundaries. That section will define the unit boundaries. If the declaration fails to do so, the provisions of Section [34-36.1-2.02] apply.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In summary, Section [34-36.1-2.02] provides that, if the declaration is silent, all non-loadbearing and non-structural portions of the walls, floors and ceilings are part of the unit, while all loadbearing and structural portions of the walls, floors and ceilings are common elements. Further, with respect to any structure partially within and partially outside of the boundaries of a unit, any portion thereof serving only that unit is a limited common element (<i>see </i>definition in Section [34-36.1-1.03(19)]), and any portion thereof serving more than one unit or any portion of the common elements is a part of the common elements. This treats and defines ownership of all portions of the electrical, plumbing and mechanical systems serving the building not entirely within the boundaries of a unit.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>All spaces, interior partitions, electrical, plumbing and mechanical systems, and all other items within the boundaries of the unit which are attached to the unit boundaries, whether or not deemed fixtures under state law, are part of the unit.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Put simply, if any item is installed, constructed, repaired or replaced by the declarant or his successor in connection with the original sale of a stacked unit, the item is insured by the association. Clearly, this does not include items of personal property easily movable within the unit or easily removable from the unit (whether or not deemed a fixture under state law), such as a vase, table or other furnishings. If installed by the unit owner, the item should be insured by the unit owner. Those items, installed by the unit owner and not covered by the association policy, are called “improvements and betterments”.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Although “all risk” coverage is not required as to conversion buildings, but merely fire and extended coverage, this is not intended to imply that such coverage is unnecessary. “All risk” coverage is not required because it may not be appropriate in the case of an unrenovated conversion where cost is a critical factor.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. The minimum requirement as to the amount of insurance, which is 80% of the actual cash value, should not be viewed as a recommendation; rather, the 80% is a floor. Typically, many condominium documents require insurance in an amount equal to <i>100% of the replacement cost </i>of the insured property. The Act permits greater flexibility, however, inasmuch as different types of construction and varieties of projects may not require such total coverage with its attendant higher premium cost.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Subsection (a)(2) covers only the liability of the association, and unit owners as members, but does not cover the unit owner’s individual liability for his acts or omissions or liability for occurrences within his unit.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. Clause (1) of the third sentence of subsection (h) would operate as follows: (1) if the condominium consists of campsites, restoration after fire damage might consist of merely resodding the area damaged; (2) if the condominium consists of separate garden-type buildings, restoration after fire damage might consist of demolishing the remaining structure and paving or landscaping the area; and (3) if the condominium consists of a single highrise building, restoration may not be required (if the building is substantially destroyed) inasmuch as “a condition compatible with the remainder of the condominium” would be damaged and unrestored.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>8. The scheme of this section, as set forth in subsection (h), is that any damage or destruction to any portion of the condominium must be repaired (if repairs can be made consistent with applicable safety and health laws) absent a decision to terminate the condominium or a decision by 80% of the unit owners (including the owners of any damaged units) not to rebuild. Unless a decision is made not to rebuild, any available insurance proceeds must be used to effectuate such repairs. For this reason, subsection (e) provides that any loss covered by the association’s property insurance policy shall be adjusted with the association and that the proceeds for any loss shall be payable to the association or to any insurance trustee that may be designated for such purpose. Significantly, such insurance proceeds may not be paid to any mortgagee or other outside party. This provision is necessary to insure that insurance proceeds are available to effectuate any repairs or restoration to the condominium that may be required.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>9. In the case of commercial or industrial condominiums, unit owners may prefer to act as self-insurers or make other arrangements with respect to property insurance. Accordingly, subsection (i) provides that the insurance requirements of this section may be varied or waived in the case of a condominium all of the units of which are reserved exclusively for non-residential use. Such waiver or modification is not possible in the case of a mixed-use condominium, some of the units of which are used for residential purposes.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This section contemplates that a declarant might find it advantageous, particularly in the early stages of condominium development, to pay all of the expenses of the condominium himself rather than assessing each unit individually. Such a situation might arise, for example, where a declarant owns most of the units in the condominium and wishes to avoid billing the costs of each unit separately and crediting payment to each unit. It might also arise in the case of a declarant who, although willing to assume all expenses of the condominium, is unwilling to make payments for replacement reserves or for other expenses which he expects will ultimately be part of the association’s budget. Subsection (a) grants the declarant such flexibility while at the same time providing that once an assessment is made against any unit, all units, including those owned by the declarant, must be assessed for their full portion of the common expense liability.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Under subsection (c), the declaration may provide for assessment on a basis other than the allocation made in Section [34-36.1-2.07] as to limited common elements, other expenses benefiting less than all units, insurance costs, and utility costs.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. If additional units are added to a condominium after a judgment has been entered against the association, the new units are not assessed any part of the judgment debt. Since unit owners will know the assessment, and since such unpaid judgment assessments would affect the price paid by purchasers of units, it would be complicated and unnecessary to fairness to reallocate judgment assessments when new units are added.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Subsection (f) refers to those instances in which various provisions of this Act require that common expense liabilities be reallocated among the units of a condominium by amendment to the declaration. These provisions include Section [34-36.1-1.07] (Eminent Domain), Section [34-36.1-2.06] (Leasehold Condominiums), Section [34-36.1-2.10] (Exercise of Development Rights) and Section [34-36.1-2.13(b)] (Subdivision of Units).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Subsection (a) provides that the association’s lien on a unit for unpaid assessments shall be enforceable in the same manner as mortgage liens. [Enacting Instructions].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. To ensure prompt and efficient enforcement of the association’s lien for unpaid assessments, such liens should enjoy statutory priority over most other liens. Accordingly, subsection (a) provides that the association’s lien takes priority over all other liens and encumbrances except those recorded prior to the recordation of the declaration, those imposed for real estate taxes or other governmental assessments or charges against the unit, and first mortgages recorded before the date the assessment became delinquent. However, as to prior first mortgages, the association’s lien does have priority for 6 months’ assessments based on the periodic budget. A significant departure from existing practice, the 6 months’ priority for the assessment lien strikes an equitable balance between the need to enforce collection of unpaid assessments and the obvious necessity for protecting the priority of the security interests of mortgage lenders. As a practical matter, mortgage lenders will most likely pay the 6 months’ assessments demanded by the association rather than having the association foreclose on the unit. If the mortgage lender wishes, an escrow for assessments can be required. Since this provision may conflict with the provisions of some state statutes which forbid some lending institutions from making loans not secured by first priority liens, the law of each state should be reviewed and amended when necessary.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Subsection (e) makes clear that the association may have remedies short of foreclosure of its lien that can be used to collect unpaid assessments. The association, for example, might bring an action in debt or breach of contract against a recalcitrant unit owner rather than resorting to foreclosure.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. In view of the association’s powers to enforce its lien for unpaid assessments, subsection (f) provides unit owners with a method to determine the amount presently due and owing. A unit owner may obtain a statement of any unpaid assessment, including fines and other charges enforceable as assessments under subsection (a), currently levied against his unit. The statement is binding on the association, the executive board, and every unit owner in any subsequent action to collect such unpaid assessments.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Units may be part of a condominium and of a larger real estate regime (<i>see </i>the Uniform Planned Community Act, promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1980, which would govern most associations with assessment powers). For example, a large real estate development may consist of a larger planned community which contains detached single family dwellings and town houses which are not part of any condominium and a highrise building which is organized as a condominium within the planned community. In that case, the planned community association might assess the condominium units for the general maintenance expenses of the planned community and the condominium association would assess for the direct maintenance expenses of the building itself. In such a situation, subsection (c) provides that unpaid liens of the two associations have equal priority regardless of the relative time of creation of the two regimes and regardless of the time the assessments were made or become delinquent.</p>

<p class="p5">Annotations</p>
<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This section deals with the effect on unit owners of judgments against the association. The issue is not free from difficulty. Presently, in most states, if the association is organized as a corporation, the unit owners are likely to receive the insulation from liability given shareholders of a corporation, so that the judgment lienholder can satisfy his judgment only against the property of the association. On the other hand, if the association is organized as an unincorporated association, under the law of most states each unit owner would have joint and several liability on the judgment. This Act strikes a balance between the two extremes, making the judgment lien a direct lien against each individual unit, but allowing the individual unit owner to discharge the lien by payment of his pro-rata share of the judgment. The judgment would also be a lien against any property owned by the association.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. It should be noted that, while the judgment lien runs directly against unit owners, the actual liability of the unit owner is almost identical with what it would be if the ordinary corporation rule insulating the unit owner from direct liability were applied. If the incorporated association only is liable for a judgment, it will, of course, have no assets to satisfy the judgment except whatever personal property and real estate not a part of the common elements it owns. If a checking account or other cash funds of the association are attached or garnisheed by the creditor, the association, in order to maintain its operations and fulfill its other obligations, will be obliged to make an additional assessment against the unit owners to cover the judgment. The same result follows if the association is to prevent the sale of other assets at an execution sale. That additional assessment would be in precisely the amount for which this Act gives a direct lien against the individual unit owners. Further, if an association which is without sufficient assets to satisfy a judgment refuses to make assessments from which the creditor can have his claim satisfied, it is very likely that a court, in a supplemental proceeding on the judgment, would direct the association to make the necessary assessments against the unit owners. Unpaid assessments made by the association constitute liens against units just as do judgments.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Therefore, whether the lien of the judgment creditor runs against the units directly, or whether the lien is only against the association which finds it necessary to make additional assessments to satisfy the judgment, the unit owner who does not pay his proportionate share will end up with a lien against his unit.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The differences, therefore, between the lien system established by Section [34-36.1-3.17] and the system which would be applicable if ordinary corporation rules were applied are these:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(1) The unit owner can discharge his unit from the lien and free it from the possibility of being subsequently assessed by the association for the judgment by making a payment directly to the lien holder. This ability may be valuable to a unit owner who is in the process of selling or securing a mortgage on his unit during the period between the time the judgment is entered and the time the association makes a formal assessment against individual unit owners for the amount of the judgment lien.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(2) The judgment creditor through his ability to threaten to foreclose the lien on an individual unit if the judgment is not paid is given some leverage over individual unit owners to encourage them to see that the association pays the judgment. Procuring an assessment through pressure on individual unit owners may be quicker and cheaper for the judgment creditor than using supplemental proceedings and having a judge order that the board of directors make the necessary assessment.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the rare case where, under corporation law an association could avoid payment of a judgment by dissolution of the association and vesting of title to the units in the unit owners as tenants-in-common or otherwise, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws believes that that result is inappropriate, and that the unit in the condominium itself should be viewed as equity property of the association capable of being reached by judgment creditors in satisfaction of the judgment. As a matter of social policy the condominium association is in quite a different position than the ordinary corporation. The corporation statutes provide shareholders immunity from liability for debts of the corporation to encourage investment in corporations whose entrepreneurial activities in the marketplace contribute to the general wealth and well-being of society. The condominium association, in managing the affairs of the homeowners, does not serve the same entrepreneurial function. It seems reasonable, as a matter of social policy, that an individual homeowner who would be fully liable for debts incurred in the renovation and maintenance of his home or for torts caused by his failure to adequately maintain the premises should not be able to entirely avoid that liability through the device of organizing with other homeowners into a condominium association. On the other hand, it is perhaps not fair to a unit owner in a condominium regime to have all of his assets at risk based on the contracts of the association over which he has little control and as to which he has only a fractional interest or benefit.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It should be noted that, except for situations in which the association has given a mortgage or deed of trust on common elements, the judgment creditor cannot assert a lien against common elements, but is rather left to a lien against the units. That is, the judgment creditor has no power to levy on the golf course or on the swimming pool or other open spaces and sell them independently of the units to satisfy the judgment.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the purchaser of a condominium unit at a condominium association lien foreclosure sale sued to prevent a bank from foreclosing on the bank’s first mortgage recorded before the association’s lien, it was error to dismiss the suit because (1) R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-36.1-3.16(b)(2) gave the association a super-priority lien superior to the mortgage, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-36.1-3.16(b)(1)(ii), up to a certain value, and (2) the bank did not exercise a right of redemption in R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-36.1-3.21(c), so foreclosure of the assessment lien extinguished the bank’s mortgage, as the proceeds of the foreclosure sale were insufficient to satisfy the lien. Twenty Eleven, LLC v.

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the case of commercial and industrial condominiums, the purchaser is often more sophisticated than the purchaser of residential units and thus better able to bargain for the protections he believes necessary. While this may not always be true, no objective test can be developed which easily distinguishes those commercial purchasers who are able to protect themselves from those who, in the ordinary course of business, have not developed such sophistication. At the same time, the cost of protection imposed by Article 4 may be substantial. Accordingly, subsection (a) permits waiver or modification of Article 4 protections in condominiums where all units are restricted to non-residential use, <i>e.g., </i>in the case of most commercial and industrial condominiums. However, except for certain waivers of implied warranties of quality (<i>see </i>Section [34-36.1-4.15]) and certain exemptions from public offering statement and resale certificate requirements (<i>see </i>subsection (b)), no express waiver of the protections of this Article with respect to the purchasers of residential units is permitted by this subsection. Accordingly, by operation of Section [34-36.1-1.04], the rights provided by this Article may not be waived in the case of residential purchasers. Moreover, because of the interrelated rights of residential and commercial owners in mixed-use condominiums, waiver or modification of rights conferred by this Article is restricted to purchasers in wholly nonresidential condominiums.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. The best “consumer protection” that the law can provide to any purchaser is to insure that he has an opportunity to acquire an understanding of the nature of the products which he is purchasing. Such a result is difficult to achieve, however, in the case of the condominium purchaser because of the complex nature of the bundle of rights and obligations which each unit owner obtains. For this reason, the Act, adopting the approach of many so-called “second generation” condominium statutes, sets forth a lengthy list of information which must be provided to each purchaser before he contracts for a unit. This list includes a number of important matters not typically required in public offering statements under existing law. The requirement for providing the public offering statement appears in Section [34-36.1-4.02(c)], and Section [34-36.1-4.08] provides purchasers with cancellation rights and imposes civil penalties upon declarants not complying with the public offering statement requirements of the Act.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Paragraph (a)(2) requires a general description of the condominium and, to the extent possible, the declarant’s schedule for commencement and completion of construction for all building amenities that will comprise portions of the condominium. Under Section [34-36.1-2.09], the declarant is obligated to label all improvements which may be made in the condominium as either “MUST BE BUILT” or “NEED NOT BE BUILT.” Under Section [34-36.1-4.19], the declarant is obligated to complete all improvements labeled “MUST BE BUILT.” The estimated schedule of commencement and completion of construction dates provides a standard for judging whether a declarant has complied with the requirements of Section [34-36.1-4.19].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Paragraph (4) requires the public offering statement to include copies of the declaration, bylaws, and any rules and regulations of the condominium, as well as copies of any contracts or leases to be executed by the purchaser. In addition, the paragraph requires the public offering statement to include a brief narrative description of the significant features of those documents, as well as of any management contract, leases of recreational facilities, and other sorts of contracts which may be subject to cancellation by the association after the period of declarant control expires, as provided in Section [34-36.1-3.05]. This latter requirement is intended to encourage the preparation of brief summaries of all condominium documents in laymen’s terms, <i>i.e., </i>the “brief narrative description” should be more than a simple explanation of what a declaration (or other document) is, but less than an extended legal analysis duplicating the contents of the documents themselves. The summary requirement is intended to alleviate the common problem of public offering statements being drafted in lawyers’ terms and being no more comprehensible to laymen than the documents themselves.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. The disclosure requirement of paragraph (6) is intended to eliminate the common deceptive sales practice known as “lowballing,” a practice by which a declarant intentionally underestimates the budget for the association by providing many of the services himself during the initial sales period. In such a circumstance, the declarant commonly intends that, after a certain time, these services (which might include lawn maintenance, painting, security, bookkeeping, or other services) will become expenses of the association, thereby substantially increasing the periodic common expense assessments which association members must ultimately bear. By requiring the disclosure of these services (including the projected common expense assessment attributable to each) in paragraph (6), the Act seeks to minimize “lowballing”. In order to comply fully with the provisions of paragraph (5), the declarant must calculate the budget on the basis of his best estimate of the number of units which will be part of the condominium during that budget year. This requirement as well operates to negate the effects of any attempted “lowballing.”</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Paragraph (9) requires disclosure of any financing “offered” by the declarant. The paragraph contemplates that a declarant disclose any arrangements for financing that may have been made, including arrangements with any unaffiliated lender to provide mortgages to qualified purchasers.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Under paragraph (10), the declarant is required to disclose the terms of all warranties provided by the declarant (including the statutory warranties set forth in Section [34-36.1-4.14]) and to describe any significant limitations on such warranties, the enforcement thereof, or damages which may be collectible as a result of a breach thereof. This latter requirement would necessitate a description by the declarant of any exclusions or modifications of statutory warranties undertaken pursuant to Section [34-36.1-4.15]. The statute of limitations for warranties set forth in Section [34-36.1-4.16], together with any separate written agreement (as required by Section [34-36.1-4.16]) providing for reduction of the period of such statute of limitations, must also be disclosed.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. Paragraph (14) requires that the declarant disclose the existence of any right of first refusal or other restrictions on the uses for which or classes of persons to whom units may be sold.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>8. Paragraph (15) corrects a defect common to many condominium statutes by requiring the declarant to describe the insurance coverage provided for the benefit of unit owners. <i>See </i>Section [34-36.1-3.13].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>9. Under paragraph (16), the declarant is obligated to disclose any current or expected fees or charges which unit owners may be required to pay for the use of the common elements and other facilities related to the condominium. Such fees or charges might include swimming pool fees, golf course fees, or required membership fees for recreation associations. Such fees are often not disclosed to condominium purchasers and can represent a substantial addition to their monthly assessments.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>10. The “financial arrangements” required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (17) may vary substantially from one condominium development to another. It is the intent of the paragraph to give purchasers as much information as possible with which to assess the declarant’s ability to carry out his obligations to complete the improvements. For example, if a declarant has a commitment from a bank to provide construction financing for a swimming pool when 50% of the units in the condominium are completed, that fact should be disclosed to potential purchasers.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>11. In addition to the information required to be disclosed by paragraphs (1) through (18), paragraph (19) requires that the declarant disclose all other “unusual and material circumstances, features, and characteristics” of the condominium and all units therein. This requires only information which is both “unusual <i>and </i>material.” Thus, the provision does not require the disclosure of “material” factors which are commonly understood to be part of the condominium, <i>e.g., </i>the fact that a condominium has a roof, walls, doors, and windows. Similarly, the provision does not require the disclosure of “unusual” information about the condominium which is not also “material,” <i>e.g., </i>the fact that a condominium is the first condominium in a particular community. Information which would normally be required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (19) might include, to the extent that they are unusual and material, environmental conditions affecting the use or enjoyment of the condominium, features of the location of the condominium, <i>e.g., </i>near the end of an airport runway or a planned rendering plant, and the like.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>12. The cost of preparing a public offering statement can be substantial and may, particularly in the case of small condominiums, represent a significant portion of the cost of a unit. For that reason, subsection (b) permits a declarant to exclude from a public offering statement certain information in the case of a small condominium (<i>i.e., </i>less than 12 units) which is not subject to development rights and which is not potentially part of a larger condominium or group of condominiums. Essentially, subsection (b) permits a declarant to exclude from a public offering statement those materials which, as a practical matter, require extended preparation effort by an attorney or engineer in addition to the normal effort which must be exerted to provide the declaration, bylaws, plats and plans, or other documents required by the Act.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section requires disclosure in the public offering statement of the manner in which the declarant’s exercise of development rights may affect purchasers who acquire units before those rights have been fully exercised. The purpose is to put the purchaser on notice of the extent to which the exercise of those rights may alter, sometimes quite dramatically, both the physical and the legal aspects of the project. For example, the prospective purchaser may be contemplating the acquisition of a particular unit because it enjoys a view of open, undeveloped land over which the declarant has, however, reserved development rights. It may be that the boundary of the parcel as to which development rights have been reserved actually coincides with, or runs quite close to, the outer wall of the unit in question. The disclosures or statements made pursuant to paragraphs (8) and (12) of this section will indicate to the prospective purchaser the extent (if any) to which he can rely on the declarant not to do anything which would radically alter the view from the unit which he now finds so appealing.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Time sharing has become increasingly important in recent years, particularly with respect to resort condominiums. In recognition of this fact, this section requires the disclosure of certain information with respect to time sharing.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Virtually all existing state condominium statutes are silent with respect to time-share ownership.

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. In the case of a condominium containing one or more conversion buildings, the disclosure of additional information relating to the condition of those buildings is required in the public offering statement because of the difficulty inherent in a single purchaser attempting to determine the condition of what is likely to be an older building being renovated for the purpose of condominium sales.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Paragraph (a)(1) requires the person who gives the public offering statement to retain an independent architect or engineer to report on the present condition of all structural components and fixed mechanical and electrical installations in the conversion building. Such information is as useful to declarant as to the purchaser since, under the implied warranty provisions of Section [34-36.1-4.14], a declarant impliedly warrants all improvements made by any person to the building “before creation of the condominium” unless such improvements are specifically excluded from the implied warranty of quality pursuant to Section [34-36.1-4.15(b)].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. <i>See </i>Comment 6 to Section [34-36.1-2.01] concerning the meaning of “structural components” as used in paragraph (a)(1). Any material changes in the “present condition” of these systems must be reported by an amendment to the public offering statement.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Under paragraph (a)(3), the person required to give the public offering statement is required to provide purchasers with a list of all outstanding notices of uncured violations of building codes or other municipal regulations. The literal wording of this provision does not require disclosure of known violations of such building codes or municipal regulations (at least violations having no effect upon the structural components or fixed mechanical and electrical installations of the condominium) unless actual “notices” of such violations have been received. To the extent that outstanding notices of uncured violations do exist, the cost of curing such violations would become a liability of the unit owners or the association following transfer of the unit to a purchaser. For that reason, the estimated cost of curing any outstanding violations must also be disclosed.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. For the same reasons set forth in the Comment to Section [34-36.1-4.01(a)], this section does not apply to units which are restricted exclusively to non-residential use.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Some condominiums are regarded as “investment contracts” or other “securities” under federal law because they exhibit certain investment features such as mandatory rental pools. <i>See </i>SEC Securities Act Release No. 5347 (January 1973). The purpose of this section is to permit the declarant to file or deliver, in lieu of a public offering statement specifically prepared to comply with the provisions of this Act, the prospectus filed with and distributed pursuant to the regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Absent this provision, prospective purchasers of condominiums classified by the SEC as “securities” would have to be given two public offering statements, one prepared pursuant to this Act and the other prepared pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. Not only would this result increase the declarant’s costs (and thus the price) of units, it might also reduce the likelihood of either public offering statement actually being read by prospective purchasers.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. The “cooling off ” period provided to a purchaser in this section is similar to provisions in many current state condominium statutes.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Subsection (a) requires that each purchaser be provided with both the public offering statement and all amendments thereto prior to the time that the unit is conveyed. If there is a contract for the sale of the unit, these documents must be provided not later than the date of the contract. The section makes clear that any amendments to the public offering statement prepared between the date of any contract and the date of conveyance must also be provided to the purchaser.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. This section does not require the delivery of a public offering statement prior to the execution by the purchaser of an agreement pursuant to which the purchaser reserves the right to buy a unit but is not contractually bound to do so. Because such agreements (frequently referred to as “non-binding reservation agreements”) may be unilaterally cancelled at any time by a prospective purchaser without penalty, they do not constitute “contract[s] of sale” within the meaning of the section.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. The requirement set forth in subsection (a) that a purchaser be provided with subsequent amendments to the public offering statement during the period between execution of the contract for purchase and conveyance of the unit does not, in itself, extend the “cooling off ” period. Indeed, the delivery of such amendments is required even if the “cooling off ” period has expired. The purpose of this requirement is to assure that purchasers of units are advised of any material change in the condominium which may affect their sales contracts under general law. While many such amendments will be merely technical and will not affect the bargain that the purchaser and declarant entered into, each purchaser should be permitted to judge for himself the materiality of any change in the nature of the condominium.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Under the scheme set forth in this section, it is at least theoretically possible that there will be a contract for sale of the unit, and that a public offering statement will be given to the purchaser at closing just prior to conveyance. However, the available evidence suggests that such practice would be rare, and that the provision of a public offering statement moments prior to conveyance would, in itself, tend to dampen the enthusiasm of the purchaser for immediate closing. In such circumstances, under subsection (a), the purchaser would, as a matter of right, be able to extend the date of closing for 15 days from the time the public offering statement was provided. This fact, together with the generally unsatisfactory experience with mandatory “cooling off ” periods such as that imposed under the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, supports the conclusion that it is inappropriate to require a minimum period of delay between delivery of a public offering statement and conveyance.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Under subsection (a), the failure to deliver a public offering statement before conveyance does not result in a statutory right by the purchaser to cancel the conveyance or to reconvey the unit once conveyance has occurred. Any such cancellation or reconveyance right following an actual conveyance could create serious mechanical and title problems that could not be easily resolved. The failure of the Act to provide for such cancellation or reconveyance is not, however, intended to diminish any right which a purchaser may otherwise have under general state law. For example, where it appears that a seller, by deliberately failing to disclose certain material information with respect to a transaction, substantially changed the bargain which he and the purchaser entered into, it is possible under the common law in some states that reconveyance would be an available remedy.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even absent such resort to general law, however, the penalty provisions of subsection (c) are designed to provide a sufficient incentive to the seller to insure that the public offering statement is provided in the timely fashion required by the Act. The penalty so specified in the subsection is in addition to any right a prevailing purchaser may have under Section [34-36.1-4.17] to collect punitive damages and attorney’s fees in connection with his action against the declarant.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. In the case of the resale of a unit by a private unit owner who is not a declarant or a person in the business of selling real estate for his own account, a public offering statement need not be provided. <i>See </i>Section [34-36.1-4.02(c)]. Nevertheless, there are important facts which a purchaser should have in order to make a rational judgment about the advisability of purchasing the particular condominium unit. Accordingly, each unit owner not required to furnish a public offering statement under Section [34-36.1-4.02(c)] and not exempt under Section [34-36.1-4.01(b)] is required to furnish to a resale purchaser, before the execution of any contract of sale, a copy of the declaration, bylaws, and rules and regulations of the association and a variety of fiscal, insurance, and other information concerning the condominium and the unit.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. While the obligation to provide the information required by this section rests upon each unit owner (since the purchaser is in privity only with that unit owner), the association has an obligation to provide the information to the unit owner within 10 days after a request for such information. Under Section [34-36.1-3.02(a)(12)], the association is entitled to charge the unit owner a reasonable fee for the preparation of the certificate. Should the association fail to provide the certificate as required, the unit owner would have a right to action against the association pursuant to Section 34-36.1-4.17.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Under subsection (c), if a purchaser receives a resale certificate which fails to state the proper amount of the unpaid assessments due from the purchased unit, the purchaser is not liable for any amount greater than that disclosed in the resale certificate. Because a resale purchaser is dependent upon the association for information with respect to the outstanding assessments against the unit which he contemplates buying, it is altogether appropriate that the association should be prohibited from later collecting greater assessments than those disclosed prior to the time of the resale purchase.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This section applies to the sale by persons required to furnish public offering statements of residential units and of non-residential units unless waived pursuant to the provisions of Section [34-36.1-4.01]. It does not apply, however, to resales of units between private parties. Escrow provisions are not part of the law in several jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. This section provides declarant a number of choices as to the appropriate escrow agent. Whether the escrow agent must deposit the funds in an insured institutional depository, or in a particular type of account, depends on state law, or the agreement of the parties. To minimize record keeping, of course, the institutional depository could itself be the escrow agent. The section does not require a separate account for each unit, so that mingling of funds in a single escrow account would be permitted. The account may be held whether in the state where the unit is located, or in the enacting state, in recognition that buyers are often from outside the state where the unit is located.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. The escrow requirements of this section apply in connection with <i>any </i>deposit made by a purchaser, whether such deposit is made pursuant to a binding contract or pursuant to a nonbinding reservation agreement (with respect to which no public offering statement is required under Section [34-36.1-4.01(b)(6)]).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. [Enacting Instructions].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Under this section, any interest earned on an escrow deposit may, but need not, be credited to the purchaser at closing, added to any deposit forfeited to the seller, or added to any deposit refunded to the purchaser. In short, disposition of any interest is left to agreement of the parties.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. In some states, such as New York, the substitution of a bond in place of a deposit escrow is permitted. The evidence indicates, however, that in many instances the use of the bonding device has forced purchasers to incur substantial costs and delay prior to obtaining refunds to which they are entitled. For this reason, this Act does not include bonding as an alternative to the required escrow of deposits.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The exemption for withdrawable real estate set forth in subsection (a) is designed to preserve flexibility for the declarant in terms of financing arrangements. Theoretically, a developer might partially avoid the lien release requirement of subsection (a) by placing part of the common element improvements such as a swimming pool or tennis court on withdrawable real estate. By doing so, it could separately mortgage that part of the common elements without being obligated to discharge the mortgage or secure partial releases when individual units are sold. (However, even if there were no withdrawable real estate exemption from the release of lien requirement, developers could still separately mortgage such improvements as pools and tennis courts without having to discharge the mortgage on sale of units. All they would have to do is leave the particular real estate out of the condominium and then convey it directly to the association subject to the mortgage.)</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a mortgage or other lien created by or arising against the developer attaches to withdrawable real estate after the declaration has been recorded, a lapse of the developer’s right to withdraw the real estate would also terminate the rights of the lienor, since the lien would attach only to the developer’s interest (the right to withdraw). However, an alert lienor would not permit the right to withdraw to lapse without taking steps to see that the right to withdraw is exercised. If the mortgage or other lien attached to the real estate and was perfected before the condominium declaration was recorded, lapse of the right to withdraw would not affect the lienor’s rights and it could foreclose on the real estate whether or not the developer had lost the right to withdraw. As a practical matter, whether the mortgage or other lien against withdrawable real estate arises before or after the declaration is recorded, unit owners may find that, if the association does not release liens on withdrawable real estate containing common elements, the lienor will be able to withdraw the land and deprive the unit owners of its use. Therefore, unit purchasers and their counsel should be alert to that possibility.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If units are created in withdrawable real estate, the units, when sold, are subject to the release-of-lien rule of subsection (b)(1) and after a unit in a particular withdrawable parcel is sold, that parcel can no longer be withdrawn. In that case, any lien created by or arising against the developer which attached to the real estate and is subordinate to the condominium declaration would automatically expire.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> A declarant of a condominium containing conversion buildings, and any person in the business of selling real estate for his or her own account who intends to offer units in such a condominium shall give each of the residential tenants and any residential subtenant in possession of a portion of a conversion building notice of the conversion and provide those persons with the public offering statement no later than one hundred twenty (120) days before the tenants and any subtenant in possession are required to vacate. Rents shall not be increased during the notice period. The notice must set forth generally the rights of tenants and subtenants under this section and shall be hand delivered to the unit or mailed by prepaid United States mail to the tenant and subtenant at the address of the unit or any other mailing address provided by a tenant. No tenant or subtenant may be required to vacate upon less than one hundred twenty (120) days’ notice, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste, or conduct that disturbs other tenants’ peaceful enjoyment of the premises, and the terms of the tenancy may not be altered during that period. Failure to give notice as required by this section is a defense to an action for possession.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> For sixty (60) days after delivery or mailing of the notice described in subsection (a), the person required to give the notice shall offer to convey each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use to the tenant who leases that unit. Tenants shall have the right to cancel their lease and receive no penalties for the cancellation as long as all obligations of the lease have been met. If a tenant fails to purchase the unit during that sixty (60) day period, the offeror may not offer to dispose of an interest in that unit during the following one hundred eighty (180) days at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant. This subsection does not apply to any unit in a conversion building if that unit will be restricted exclusively to nonresidential use or the boundaries of the converted unit do not substantially conform to the dimensions of the residential unit for conversion.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> If a seller, in violation of subsection (b), conveys a unit to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation, recordation of the deed conveying the unit extinguishes any right a tenant may have under subsection (b) to purchase that unit if the deed states that the seller has complied with subsection (b), but does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the seller for a violation of subsection (b).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> If a notice of conversion specifies a date by which a unit or proposed unit must be vacated, and otherwise complies with the provisions of chapter 18 of this title the notice also constitutes a notice to vacate specified by that statute.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. One of the most controversial issues in the field of condominium development relates to conversion of rental buildings to condominiums. Opponents of conversions point out that the frequent result of conversions, which occur principally in large urban areas, is to displace low and moderate-income tenants and provide homes for more affluent persons able to afford the higher prices which the converted apartments command. Indeed, studies indicate that the burden of conversion displacement falls most frequently on low- and moderate-income and elderly persons. At the same time, the conversion of a building to condominium ownership can lead to a substantial increase in property value, a result which proponents believe can be an important factor in curtailing the problem of declining urban tax bases. Proponents also point out that the conversion of rental units in inner-city areas to individual ownership frequently results in the stabilization of the buildings concerned, thus providing an important technique for use in neighborhood preservation and revitalization. This section, which seeks to balance these competing interests, is based principally on similar provisions set forth in the condominium statutes of Virginia and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. In an attempt to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of rental tenants and prospective owners, subsection (b) provides the tenant a right for 60 days to purchase the unit which he leases at a price and on terms offered by the declarant. The subsection discourages unreasonable offers by declarants by providing that, if the tenant fails to accept the terms offered, the declarant may not thereafter sell the unit at a lower price or upon more favorable terms to a third person for at least 180 days. However, the declarant is not required to offer residential tenants the right to purchase commercial units or to offer to sell to tenants if the dimensions of their previous apartments have been substantially altered. The reason for this exception is that, if an apartment is subdivided or if two apartments are merged into a single condominium unit, compliance with the requirements of subsection (b) would be impossible.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. [Enacting Instructions].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Except for the restrictions on permissible evictions stated in subsection (a), this Act does not change the law of summary process in a state. As a result, if a tenant refuses to vacate the premises following the 120-day notice, the usual provisions of the state’s summary process statutes would apply, while any defenses available to a tenant would also be available.</p>

P.L. 1982, ch. 329, § 2.</p>
<p class="p5">Annotations</p>
<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This section, together with Sections [34-36.1-4.14, 34-36.1-4.15, and 34-36.1-4.16], are adapted from the real estate warranty provisions contained in the Uniform Land Transactions Act (ULTA).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. This section, which parallels Section 2-308 of ULTA, deals with express warranties, that is, with the expectations of the purchaser created by particular conduct of the declarant in connection with inducement of the sale. It is based on the principle that, once it is established that the declarant has acted so as to create particular expectations in the purchaser, warranty should be found unless it is clear that, prior to the time of final agreement, the declarant has negated the conduct which created the expectation.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Subsection (b) makes it clear that no specific intention to make a warranty is necessary if any of the factors mentioned in subsection (a) are made part of the basis of the bargain between the parties. In actual practice, representations made by a declarant concerning condominium property during the bargaining process are typically regarded as a part of the description. Therefore, no particular reliance on the representations need be shown in order to weave them into the fabric of the agreement. Rather, the burden is on the declarant to show that representations made in the bargaining process were not relied upon by the purchaser at the time of contracting.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Subsection (a)(1) provides that representations as to improvements and facilities not located in the condominium may create express warranties. Declarants often assert that recreational facilities, such as swimming pools, golf courses, tennis courts, etc., will be constructed in the future and that unit owners will have the right to utilize such facilities once constructed. Such assertions are intended to be included within the language “have the benefit of facilities not located in the condominium.” If, under the circumstances, such improvements would benefit the unit being sold, then the declarant may be liable for breach of express warranty if they are not completed. Such liability is distinct from the declarant’s obligations, under Section [34-36.1-4.19], to complete all improvements labeled “MUST BE BUILT” on plats and plans.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. Under subsection (a)(4), a contract provision permitting the purchaser to use a condominium unit only for a specified use or uses creates an express warranty that the unit may lawfully be used for that purpose. Therefore, if there is a limitation on use, the resulting express warranty could not be disclaimed by a disclaimer of implied warranties under Section [34-36.1-4.15].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. The precise time when representations set forth in subsection (a) are made is not material. The sole question is whether the language or other representations of the declarant are fairly to be regarded as part of the contract between the parties.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. Subsection (b) makes clear that it is not necessary to the existence of a warranty that the declarant have intended to assume a warranty obligation. On the other hand, mere statements of opinion or commendations by the declarant do not necessarily create warranties. Whether a particular statement purports to be merely opinion or commendation is basically a question of whether the purchaser could reasonably rely upon the statement as a meaningful representation or promise with respect to the condominium. That determination depends, in turn, not merely upon the words used but also upon the relative characteristics and skills of the parties. Thus a representation by a declarant to a novice purchaser that a particular condominium unit is in “good condition” may be more than mere opinion or commendation, while the same statement by a novice seller to a professional buyer would likely be only opinion or commendation, and thus not a warranty.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>8. The provision of subsection (c) that the conveyance of a unit transfers to the purchaser all express warranties made by prior declarants is intended, in part, to avoid the possibility that a declarant could negate his warranty obligations through the device of transferring a unit through a shell entity to the ultimate purchaser.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This section, which is based upon Section 2-309 of ULTA, overturns the rule still applied in many states that a professional seller of real estate makes no implied warranties of quality (the rule of <i>“caveat emptor”). </i>In recent years, that rule has been increasingly recognized as a relic of an earlier age whose continued existence defeats reasonable expectations of purchasers. Since the 1930’s, more and more courts have completely or partially abolished the <i>caveat emptor </i>rule, and it is clear that the judicial tide is now running in favor of seller liability.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. The principal warranty imposed under this section is that of suitability of both the unit and common elements for ordinary uses of real estate of similar type, and of quality of construction. Both of these warranties, which arise under subsection (b), are imposed only against declarants and not against unit owners selling their units to others.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Many recent cases have held that a seller of new housing impliedly warrants that the houses sold are habitable. The warranty of suitability under this Act is similar to the warranty of habitability. However, under the Act, the warranty of suitability applies to both units and common elements in both commercial and residential condominiums. If, for example, a commercial unit is sold for commercial use although it is not suitable for the ordinary uses of condominium units of that type, the warranty of suitability has been breached. Moreover, this warranty of suitability arises in the case of used, as well as new, buildings or other improvements in the condominium.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. The warranty of suitability and of quality of construction arises only against a declarant and persons in the business of selling real estate for their own account. As in the case of sales of goods, a non-professional seller is liable, if at all, only for any express warranties made by him. However, if a non-professional seller fails to disclose defects of which he is aware, he may be liable to the purchaser for fraud or misrepresentation under the common law of the state where the transaction occurred. Also, the warranties imposed by this section may be used to give content to a general “guarantee” by a non-professional seller.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. The warranty as to quality of construction for improvements made or contracted for by the declarant or made by any person before the creation of the condominium is broader than the warranty of suitability. Particularly, it imposes liability for defects which may not be so serious as to render the condominium unsuitable for ordinary purposes of real estate of similar type. Moreover, subsection (e) prevents a declarant from avoiding liability with respect to the quality of construction warranty by having an affiliated entity make the desired improvements.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>6. Under subsection (c), a declarant also warrants to a residential purchaser that an existing use contemplated by the parties does not violate applicable law. The declarant, therefore, is liable for any violation of housing codes or other laws which renders any existing use of the condominium unlawful.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>7. The issue of declarant liability for warranties is an important one in cases where a transfer of the declarant’s rights occurs, either as an arm’s length transaction, as a transfer to an affiliate, or as a transfer by foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Subsection (f) makes clear that a conveyance of a unit transfers to the purchaser all warranties of quality made by any declarant, and Section [34-36.1-3.04(b)(1)] makes clear that the original declarant remains liable for all warranties of quality with respect to improvements made by him, even after he transfers all declarant rights, regardless of whether the unit is purchased from the declarant who made the improvements. If the successor declarant is an affiliate of the original declarant, it is clear, under both Sections [34-36.1-3.04(b)(2)] and [34-36.1-4.14(f)], that the original declarant remains liable for warranties of quality or improvements made by his successor even after the declarant himself ceases to have any special declarant rights.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>8. As to the liabilities of successor declarants for warranties of quality, a successor who is an affiliate of a declarant is liable, pursuant to Section [34-36.1-3.04(e)(1)], for warranties or improvements made by his predecessor. However, any non-affiliated successor of the original declarant is liable only for warranties of quality for improvements made or contracted for by him, and is not liable for warranties which may lie against the original declarant even if the successor sells units completed by the original declarant to a purchaser. <i>See </i>Section [34-36.1-3.04(e)(2)]. In the case of a foreclosing lender, this is the same result as that reached under Section 2-309(f) of ULTA. The same result is also reached under ULTA in the case of a successor who, under ULTA Section 3-309(b), would be a seller in the business of selling real estate since under that subsection the seller is liable only for warranties or improvements made or contracted for by him.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. This section parallels Section 2-311(b) and (c) of ULTA.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Under this section, implied warranties of quality may be disclaimed. However, a warranty disclaimer clause, like any other contract clause, is subject to a possible court holding of unconscionability. Although the section imposes no requirement that a disclaimer be in writing, except in the case of residential units, an oral disclaimer might be ineffective under the law of parole and extrinsic evidence.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Except as against purchasers of residential units, there are no formal standards for the effectiveness of a disclaimer clause. All that is necessary under this section is that the disclaimer be calculated to effectively notify the purchaser of the nature of the disclaimer.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>4. Under subsection (b), general disclaimers of implied warranties are not permitted with respect to purchasers of residential units. However, a declarant may disclaim liability for a specified defect or a specified failure to comply with applicable law in an instrument signed by such a purchaser. The requirement that the disclaimer as to each defect or failure be in a signed instrument is designed to insure that the declarant sufficiently calls each defect or failure to the purchaser’s attention and that the purchaser has the opportunity to consider the effect of the particular defect or failure upon the bargain of the parties. Consequently, this section imposes a special burden upon the declarant who desires to make a “laundry list” of defects or failures by requiring him to emphasize each item on such a list and make its import clear to prospective purchasers. For example, the declarant of a conversion condominium might, consistent with this subsection, disclaim certain warranties for “all electrical wiring and fixtures in the building, the furnace, all materials comprising or supporting the roof, and all components of the air conditioning system.”</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>5. This section is not intended to be inconsistent with, or to prevent, the use of insured warranty programs offered by some home builders. However, under the Act, the implied warranty that a new condominium unit will be suitable for ordinary uses (<i>i.e., </i>habitable) and will be constructed in a sound, workmanlike manner, and free of defective materials, cannot be disclaimed by general language.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>COMMISSIONER’S COMMENT</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>1. Under subsection (a), the parties may agree that the statute of limitations be reduced to as little as 2 years. However, such a contract provision (which, in the case of residential units, must be reflected in a separate written instrument executed by the purchaser) could, like other contract provisions, be subject to attack on grounds of unconscionability in particular cases.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>2. Except for warranties of quality which explicitly refer to future performance or duration, a cause of action for breach of a warranty of quality would normally arise when the purchaser to whom it is first made enters into possession. Suit on such a warranty would thus have to be brought within 6 years thereafter. Even an inability to discover the breach would not delay the running of the statute of limitations in this regard.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3. Real estate sales frequently include warranties that certain components (<i>e.g., </i>furnaces, hot water heaters, air conditioning systems, and roofs) will last for a particular period of time. In the case of such warranties, the statute of limitations would not start running until the breach is discovered, or, if not discovered before the end of the warranty term, until the end of the term.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> In the State of Rhode Island, hereinafter referred to as the state, many people are denied equal opportunity in obtaining housing accommodations and are forced to live in circumscribed areas because of discriminatory housing practices based upon race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, lawful source of income, military status as a veteran with an honorable discharge or an honorable or general administrative discharge, servicemember in the armed forces, country of ancestral origin, disability, age, familial status, or on the basis that a tenant or applicant or a member of the household is, or has been, or is threatened with being the victim of domestic abuse, or that the tenant or applicant has obtained, or sought, or is seeking, relief from any court in the form of a restraining order for protection from domestic abuse. These practices tend unjustly to condemn large groups of inhabitants to dwell in segregated districts or under depressed living conditions in crowded, unsanitary, substandard, and unhealthful accommodations. These conditions breed intergroup tension as well as vice, disease, juvenile delinquency, and crime; increase the fire hazard; endanger the public health; jeopardize the public safety, general welfare, and good order of the entire state; and impose substantial burdens on the public revenues for the abatement and relief of conditions so created. These discriminatory and segregative housing practices are inimical to and subvert the basic principles upon which the colony of Rhode Island was founded and upon which the state and the United States were later established. Discrimination and segregation in housing tend to result in segregation in our public schools and other public facilities, which is contrary to the policy of the state and the constitution of the United States. Further, discrimination and segregation in housing adversely affect urban renewal programs and the growth, progress, and prosperity of the state. In order to aid in the correction of these evils, it is necessary to safeguard the right of all individuals to equal opportunity in obtaining housing accommodations free of discrimination.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> It is hereby declared to be the policy of the state to assure to all individuals regardless of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, lawful source of income, military status as a veteran with an honorable discharge or an honorable or general administrative discharge, servicemember in the armed forces, country of ancestral origin, or disability, age, familial status, housing status, or those tenants or applicants or members of a household who are, or have been, or are threatened with being the victims of domestic abuse, or those tenants or applicants who have obtained, or sought, or are seeking relief from any court in the form of a restraining order for protection from domestic abuse, equal opportunity to live in decent, safe, sanitary, and healthful accommodations anywhere within the state in order that the peace, health, safety, and general welfare of all the inhabitants of the state may be protected and ensured.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Construction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The literal meaning of this section is precise, plain, and clear; therefore, literal reading presumptively gives its correct sense, and that sense cannot be ignored or disregarded merely because the legislature directed in § 34-37-9 that the provisions of the Fair Housing Practices Act shall be liberally construed in order to accomplish its purposes.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Nothing elsewhere in this act is repugnant to election of this section to prohibit only direct discrimination, nor do the words used to accomplish that effect, when read literally, suggest a meaning which is not sensible, or a result which is absurd, or a purpose which runs counter to the expressed legislative policy of providing equal housing opportunities for all.

<p class="p7"><b>Discrimination.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Prior to the 1970 amendment, this section did not prohibit indirect discrimination so as to make it unlawful for a landlord to evict a tenant for associating with a Negro; it made race, color, religion, or ancestry of tenant or purchaser the only test for violation.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> At the present time, many persons have been rendered homeless as a result of economic hardship, a severe shortage of safe, affordable housing, and a shrinking social safety net.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> Article 1, Section 2 of the Rhode Island State Constitution states in part, that “All free governments are instituted for the protection, safety, and happiness of the people. All laws, therefore, should be made for the good of the whole; and the burdens of the state ought to be fairly distributed among its citizens. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied equal protection of the laws.”</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> Concordant with this fundamental belief, no person should suffer unnecessarily or be subject to unfair discrimination based on his or her homeless status. It is the intent of this chapter to ameliorate the adverse effects visited upon individuals and our communities when the state’s residents lack a home.</p>

An amendment that materially detracts from a specific conservation or preservation value intended for protection may be approved only when it is found by the court that the proposed amendment: is between a separate distinct conservation or preservation restriction holder and the fee landowner; creates a net gain in the overall conservation or preservation purpose for which it was intended; and is consistent with the conservation or preservation purposes expressed by the parties in the restriction and the public conservation or preservation interest. No such approval may be sought except with the consent of the holder.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> An agreement to terminate all time-shares in a time-share property must be evidenced by the execution of a termination agreement, or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of time-share owners. The termination agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. A termination agreement and a certification by the managing entity of the ratification thereof must be recorded in every municipal office of land-evidence records in which a portion of the time-share property is situated, and is effective only upon recordation.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Unless the termination agreement sets forth the material terms of a contract, or proposed contract, under which an estate or interest in each time-share unit equal to the sum of the time-shares therein is to be sold and designates a trustee to effect the sale, title to an estate or interest in each time-share unit equal to the sum of the time-shares therein vests upon termination in the time-share owners thereof, in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (e), and liens on the time-shares shift accordingly to encumber those interests. Any co-owner of that estate or interest in a unit may thereafter maintain an action for partition or for allotment or sale in lieu of partition pursuant to the laws of this state.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> If the termination agreement sets forth the material terms of a contract or proposed contract under which an estate or interest in each time-share unit equal to the sum of the time-shares therein is to be sold and designates a trustee to effect the sale, title to that estate or interest vests upon termination in the trustee, for the benefit of the time-share owners, in fee simple and free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, to be transferred pursuant to the contract. Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to time-share owners with the fractional interests in the time-shares and lienholders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of the time-share owners as provided in subsection (e). After the title so vests in the trustee, the time-share owners shall have no further real property ownership interest or other right in and to their former unit, and their interest and rights shall be limited to only the proceeds remaining with the trustee or the registry of the court except as may be provided in subsection (c)(4) of this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> Except as otherwise specified in the termination agreement, so long as the former time-share owners or their trustee hold title to the estate or interest equal to the sum of the time-shares, each former time-share owner and his or her successors in interest have the same rights with respect to occupancy in the former time-share unit that he or she would have had if termination had not occurred, together with the same liabilities and other obligations imposed by this chapter or the time-share instrument.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> After termination of all time-shares in a time-share property and adequate provision for the payment of any liens or encumbrances on the property of the association and the claims of the creditors for time-share expenses, distribution must be made, in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (e), to the former time-share owners and the mortgagees and lien holders having an interest in their respective time-share units as their interests may appear and their successors in interest of (i) The proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section; (ii) The proceeds of any personalty held for the use and benefit of the former time-share owners; and (iii) Any other funds held for the use and benefit of the former time-share owners. Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens perfected against the time-share property before the termination may enforce those liens against only the proceeds from the sale of the property in the same manner as any other lienholder. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the time-share property immediately before termination.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The termination instrument may specify the respective fractional or percentage interest in the proceeds from the sale of each unit equal to the sum of the time-shares therein that will be owned by each former time-share owner. If specified in the termination instrument, the percentage interests shall be based upon an appraisal of the fair-market value of each time-share by one or more impartial qualified appraisers. Otherwise, not more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the termination, an appraisal must be made of the fair-market value of each time-share by one or more qualified appraisers selected either by the trustee designated in the termination agreement, or by the managing entity if no trustee was so designated. The appraisal must also state the corresponding fractional or percentage interests calculated in proportion to those values and in accordance with this subsection. A notice stating all of those values and corresponding interests and the return address of the sender must be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the managing entity or by the trustee designated in the termination agreements, to all of the time-share owners at their last known address as shown on the records of the association. The appraisal governs the magnitude of each interest and shall be presented to the superior court sitting in the county in which the time-share property is located for review and approval and distribution of the proceeds of the sale pursuant to the termination plan unless (i) At least twenty-five percent (25%) of the time-share owners deliver, within sixty (60) days after the date the notices were mailed, written disapprovals to the return address of the sender of the notice, or (ii) The final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, entered during or after that period, holds that the appraisal should be set aside. The appraisal and the calculation of interests must be made in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> If the termination agreement sets forth the material terms of a contract, or proposed contract, for the sale of the estate or interest equal to the sum of the time-shares, each time-share conferring a right of occupancy during a limited number of time periods must be appraised as if the time until the date specified for the conveyance of the property had already elapsed. Otherwise, each time-share of that kind must be appraised as if the time until the date specified pursuant to subsection (c) had already elapsed.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The interest of each time-share owner is the value of the time-share he or she owned divided by the sum of the values of all time-shares in the unit or units to which his or her time-share applies.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against all of the time-shares in a time-share property does not of itself terminate those time-shares. Provided, however, a foreclosure sale of a time-share association lien conducted in accordance with the Rhode Island general laws shall be deemed to vest title in the grantee/transferee at that sale upon the recording of the foreclosure deed, without further action if no adverse litigation contesting that foreclosure has been commenced within one year after recording of that foreclosure deed or the effective date of this statute, whichever is later, and if there is no cause of action commenced based solely on the consideration for that purchase pending within one year of the recording of that foreclosure deed or the effective date of this statute, whichever is later.</p>

The owner delivering the petition may attach to it a letter of not more than two (2) pages to be mailed with the ballots. Within ten (10) days after receiving the petition, the managing entity shall mail to each owner a ballot setting forth the language of the petition and affording an opportunity to indicate a preference between approval and disapproval of the proposal, together with a copy of any letter of not more than two (2) pages attached by the owner who delivered the petition.

A signature on the petition must be treated for the purpose of § 34-41-3.14(f) as a ballot from the signer indicating approval of the proposed amendment. A simple majority of the votes counted suffices for the adoption of the proposal unless other law or the document to be amended specifies a larger majority or, in the case of a proposed expenditure, the project instruments specify a larger majority not exceeding sixty-six and two-thirds percent (662/3%). No document may specify more than a simple majority for any proposal the managing entity could have effected unilaterally.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The owners may discharge the manager with or without cause in the manner provided by this section in addition to any manner permitted by other law or by the project instrument.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Any owner may prepare a ballot affording the opportunity to indicate a preference between retaining the present manager and discharging him or her in favor of a new manager. A copy of the ballot and of any letter that is to be mailed with the ballots must be delivered to the manager. Not less than ten (10) or more than thirty (30) days thereafter, a ballot and a copy of any letter to be mailed, together with a copy of any written reply received from the manager containing no more pages than the letter, must be mailed to each owner by the owner who prepared the ballot.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> On the date specified pursuant to § 34-41-3.14(c)(2), the person who receives the ballots shall examine those that have been returned, tabulate the vote accordingly, and notify the manager of the result. If at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (662/3%) of the vote, representing at least thirty-three and one-third percent (331/3%) of the votes allocated to all owners, favors discharging the manager, the developer also must be notified of the result, the ballots or photocopies thereof must be given to the manager, and the developer shall diligently attempt to procure offers for management contracts from prospective managers. Any owner also may attempt to procure such offers. If the developer or any owner obtains such an offer within sixty (60) days after the date the vote was tabulated, he or she shall notify the developer and the owner who was responsible for tabulating the vote. If no offer is obtained from a prospective manager other than the current manager within those sixty (60) days, that period must be extended for successive intervals of thirty (30) days each until such an offer is obtained. At the end of the period, the owner who prepared the ballot, or the developer if that owner so directs in a writing delivered to the developer, shall prepare and mail to each owner a second ballot stating at least the term and compensation provided by each offer that has been received and affording an opportunity to indicate a preference for any one of the offers or for retaining the current manager. A letter recommending that a particular offer be accepted or that the current manager be retained may accompany the ballot, and if the developer prepared the ballot he or she shall enclose a copy of any such letter submitted to him or her by the owner who was responsible for tabulating the vote. The developer has no obligation under this subsection, and nothing need be delivered to him or her, if he or she owned no estate or interest in any unit on the date the first ballot was delivered to the manager and neither the developer nor his or her affiliates or appointees caused the manager to be hired.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> On the date specified pursuant to § 34-41-3.14(c)(2), the person who receives the ballots prepared pursuant to subsection (c) shall examine those that have been returned, tabulate the vote accordingly, notify the manager of the result, and hold the ballots available for inspection by the manager and any proposed manager for at least thirty (30) days. If more votes favor accepting a particular offer than retaining the manager, the manager is discharged ninety (90) days after he or she is notified of the result, but, if the ballot prepared pursuant to subsection (b) was delivered to the manager before the current term of the manager began, the manager is discharged immediately upon being notified of the result. The person who received the ballots prepared pursuant to subsection (c) shall accept on behalf of the owners the offer that received the largest number of votes. The expenses thereunder are thereafter part of the common expenses.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> A manager discharged pursuant to this section is not entitled by reason of his or her discharge to any penalty or other charge payable directly or indirectly in whole or in part by any owner other than the developer.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The reasonable expenses incurred by any owner in obtaining offers and preparing and mailing ballots pursuant to this section, including reasonable attorney’s fees, must be promptly collected by the managing entity from all owners as a common expense and paid to that owner if a simple majority of the vote tabulated pursuant to subsection (c) favors the discharge of the manager. Similar expenses incurred by the developer also must be so collected and promptly paid to the developer.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> A developer of a time-share property which includes all or any part of a conversion building, and any person in the business of selling real estate for his or her own account who intends to offer time shares in such a property, shall give each of the residential tenants and any residential subtenant in possession of the proposed time-share units notice of the conversion no later than one hundred twenty (120) days before the developer will require the tenants and any subtenant in possession to vacate. Rents shall not be increased during the notice period. The notice must set forth generally the rights of tenants and subtenants under this section and be hand-delivered to the unit or mailed to the tenant and subtenant at the address of the unit or any other mailing address provided by a tenant. No tenant or subtenant may be required by the developer to vacate upon less than one hundred twenty (120) days’ notice, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste, or conduct that disturbs other tenants’ peaceful enjoyment of the premises, and the terms of the tenancy may not be altered during that period. Failure to give notice as required by this section is a defense to an action for possession.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> For sixty (60) days after delivery or mailing of the notice described in subsection (a), the person required to give the notice shall offer to convey each time-share unit or time-share proposed unit occupied for residential use to the tenant who leases that unit. Tenants shall have the right to cancel their lease and receive no penalties for the cancellation as long as all obligations of the lease have been met. If a tenant fails to purchase the unit during the sixty (60) day period, the offeror may not offer to dispose of an interest in that unit during the following one hundred eighty (180) days at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant. This subsection does not apply to any unit in a conversion building if that unit will be restricted exclusively to nonresidential use of the boundaries of the converted unit do not substantially conform to the dimension of the residential unit for conversion.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> If a seller, in violation of subsection (b), conveys a time-share unit to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation, recordation of the deed conveying the unit extinguishes any right a tenant may have under subsection (b) to purchase that unit if the deed states that the seller has complied with subsection (b), but does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the seller for a violation of subsection (b).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> If a notice of conversion specifies a date by which a unit must be vacated and otherwise complies with the provisions of chapter 18 of this title, the notice also constitutes a notice to vacate specified by that statute.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(e) (1)</b> Notwithstanding the notice provisions of subsection (a) any tenant who has continuously resided in the unit for ten (10) years or more or any tenant who has attained the age of sixty-two (62) shall be given one year notice. Rents shall not be increased during the notice period. A tenant as described in this subsection shall have one hundred eighty (180) days within which to purchase the unit as provided for in subsection (b) and the remaining provisions of that subsection shall apply.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The owner or developer shall pay reasonable moving expenses and costs, to any tenant who has attained the age of sixty-two (62), within a fifty (50) mile radius.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> In any proceeding described in § 34-44-3 of this chapter, if the court makes the finding described in that section and additionally finds that the building in question constitutes a public nuisance and that the owner of the building has been afforded reasonable opportunity to begin correcting the dangerous or unsafe condition found or to begin eliminating the violation found and has refused or failed to do so, the court shall cause notice of its findings to be served upon the owner, each mortgagee or other lienholder of record, and any other interested party, and shall order the parties to show cause why a receiver should not be appointed to perform any work and to furnish any material that reasonably may be required to abate the public nuisance. The notice shall be served in the same manner as described in § 34-44-3 of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Before appointing a receiver to perform any work to abate a public nuisance under this chapter, the court shall conduct a hearing at which any mortgagee of record or lienholder of record, or other interested party in the order of his or her priority of interest in title shall be offered the opportunity to undertake the work and to furnish the materials as are necessary to abate the public nuisance. The court shall require the party selected to demonstrate the ability promptly to undertake the work required, to provide the judge with a viable financial and construction plan for the rehabilitation of the building, and to post security for the performance of the work. All amounts expended by the party toward abating the public nuisance shall be a lien on the property if the expenditures were approved in advance by the court and if the party desires such a lien. The lien shall bear the interest, and shall be payable upon the terms approved by the court. The lien shall have the same priority as the mortgage of a receiver, as set forth in § 34-44-6, if a certified copy of the court order that approved the expenses, the interest, and the terms of payment of the lien, and a description of the property in question are filed for record, within thirty (30) days of the date of issuance of the order, in the office of the recorder of deeds of the municipality in which the property is located. If the court determines at the hearing that no party can undertake the work and furnish the materials required to abate the public nuisance, or if the court determines at any time after the hearing that any party who is undertaking corrective work pursuant to this chapter cannot or will not proceed, or has not proceeded with due diligence, the judge may appoint a receiver to take possession and control of the property. The receiver shall be appointed in the manner provided in subsection (c).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> No person shall be appointed a receiver unless he or she first has provided the court with a viable financial and construction plan for the rehabilitation of the property in question and has demonstrated the capacity and expertise to perform the required work in a satisfactory manner. Prior to the appointment of a receiver the court may grant access to the property in question to any person who applies to be appointed the receiver of the property, for the limited purpose of developing a viable financial and construction plan for the rehabilitation of the property which shall include the items set forth in § 34-44-4.1. The appointed receiver may be a financial institution that possesses an interest of record in the property, a nonprofit corporation that is duly organized and has as one of its goals the improvement of housing conditions for low and moderate income persons in the municipality in which the property in question is located, or any other qualified property manager who certifies that any rehabilitation of the property in question will not result in the long term displacement of low and moderate income persons.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The general assembly recognizes, finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> There exists a serious shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary rental units that are available at rents affordable to low and moderate income families in Rhode Island. Many families are denied access to decent housing because they are unable to meet the higher cost of rent. Rising housing costs in Rhode Island force low and moderate income families to live in unsafe, substandard units; commit such an unreasonably high percentage of their income for rent that they deprive themselves of the other necessities of life; or, worse, find themselves without housing. The inadequacy in the supply of decent, safe and sanitary affordable rental housing endangers the public health and jeopardizes the public safety, general welfare, and good of the entire state.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Approximately sixty-seven hundred (6,700) units of housing in sixty-five (65) developments in Rhode Island which are presently affordable to low and moderate income families are in danger of becoming unaffordable due to expiring use restrictions on the property. Low income housing units insured or assisted under §§ 221(d)(3) and 236 of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq., could be lost as a result of the termination of low income affordability restrictions; low income housing units produced with assistance under § 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c), could be lost as a result of the expiration of the rental assistance contracts; and rural low income housing financed under § 515 of the Housing Act of 1949, 12 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq., are threatened with loss as a result of the prepayment of mortgages by owners. The loss of this privately owned and federally assisted housing, which would occur in a period of sharply rising rents on unassisted housing and extremely low production of additional low rent housing, would inflict unacceptable harm on current tenants and would precipitate a grave crisis in the supply of low income housing that was neither anticipated nor intended when contracts for these units were entered into.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> There is, therefore, a compelling need to preserve the affordability of these rental housing units to low and moderate income persons and families in Rhode Island in order to prevent the displacement of these persons and families and to assure an adequate supply of affordable housing for these persons and families in Rhode Island.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Under a written instrument which is executed either by the owner of an interest in the commercial real estate or by the owner’s authorized agent; or</p>

<p class="p6">The lien shall be available to the real estate broker named or referred to in the agreement or instrument signed by the owner, buyer, or tenant (or their respective agents) and not to an employee or independent contractor employed by or affiliated with the real estate broker.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> A lien under this chapter shall attach to the commercial real estate or any interest in the commercial real estate upon:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The real estate broker being entitled to compensation under a written instrument signed by the owner, buyer, tenant, or their authorized agent, as applicable; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Except as provided in subsections (c), (d), (e), or (f) below, the real estate broker recording a notice of lien in the land evidence records for the municipality in which the commercial real estate or any interest in the commercial real estate is located, prior to the recording of an actual instrument of conveyance or transfer of legal title to the commercial real estate against which the real estate broker claims a lien by the party from whom compensation is claimed. The lien shall attach as of the date of the recording of the notice of lien and does not and shall not relate back to the date of the written agreement. If a notice of lien is recorded after the date of recording of an instrument conveying or transferring legal title to the commercial real estate from the party from whom compensation is claimed, then such notice of lien shall not constitute a lien on the interest in commercial real estate held by the transferee.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Except as provided in subsections (d), (e), or (f) when payment to a real estate broker is due in installments, a portion of which is due only after the conveyance or transfer of the commercial real estate or interest therein, any notice of lien for those payments due after the transfer or conveyance may be recorded at any time which is subsequent to the transfer or conveyance of the commercial real estate or interest therein or which time is within ninety (90) days of the date on which the payment is due. Such notice of lien shall only be effective as a lien against the transferor’s interest in the commercial real estate to the extent funds are owed to the transferor by the transferee, but the lien shall be effective as a lien against the transferee’s interest in the commercial real estate without limitations described above in this section. A single claim for lien recorded prior to transfer or conveyance of the commercial real estate or interest therein claiming all compensation due in installments shall also be valid and enforceable as it pertains to payments due after the transfer or conveyance; provided however, that as payments or partial payments of compensation are received, the real estate broker shall provide partial releases therefor, thereby reducing the amount due the real estate broker under its lien.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> In the case of a lease (which shall also include a sublease or assignment of lease), the notice of lien must be recorded not later than ninety (90) days after the tenant occupies the leased premises. Provided, however, that if the landlord serves written notice of the intended execution of the lease by personal service on the real estate broker entitled to claim a lien, at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the intended execution of the lease, the notice of lien must be recorded before the date indicated in such notice for the execution of the lease. The lien shall attach as of the recording of the notice of lien and does not and shall not relate back to the date of the written agreement.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> If a real estate broker may be due any compensation excluding compensation due upon execution of the initial lease, such as compensation arising from and including, but not limited to, the exercise of an option: (1) To expand leased premises; (2) To renew or extend a lease; or (3) To purchase commercial real estate; which compensation is due, pursuant to a written agreement or instrument signed by the then owner or tenant (collectively “future commissions”), then the real estate broker may record its notice of lien at any time after execution of the lease or other written agreement which contains such rights, but not later than ninety (90) days after the occurrence of the act or event on which the future commission is claimed. An action to enforce a lien to collect future commissions must be commenced within two (2) years of the act or event for which the future commission is claimed.</p>

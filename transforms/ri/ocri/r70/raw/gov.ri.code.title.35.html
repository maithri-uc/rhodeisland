In the course of an audit or investigation, the office of internal audit shall review statutes and regulations of the public body and shall determine if such a public body is in compliance and shall make recommendations concerning the efficiency of operations, and the effect of such statutes or regulations on internal controls and the prevention and detection of fraud, waste and abuse. The chief of internal audit may recommend policies or procedures that may strengthen internal controls, or assist in the prevention or detection of fraud, waste, and abuse or mismanagement.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The person, or persons, with legal authority for any public body may request the assistance of the office of internal audit.

Whenever the authority has satisfied the court that the claims of all persons interested in the land taken have been satisfied, the unexpended balance, including any interest of increment on any sums so deposited, shall be paid forthwith to the authority.</p>

The proceeds of bonds or notes issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds or notes may be applied, in the discretion of the authority, to the purchase, retirement at maturity, or redemption of the outstanding bonds or notes either on their earliest or a subsequent redemption date, and may, pending the application, be placed in escrow.

After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied and carried out, any balance of the proceeds and interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on the investments thereof may be returned to the authority for use by it in furtherance of its purposes. The issuance of the bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the rights, duties, and obligations of the authority in respect of the same shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter insofar as the same may be applicable.</p>

<p class="p6">“Whereas, it has been made to appear to this general assembly, upon the representation of Titus Weeks, Esq., executor of the last will and testament of Abraham Touro, Esq., of the city of Boston, in the state of Massachusetts, that the said Abraham by his last will bequeathed a legacy in the following words, viz.: ‘Item. — I give ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to the legislature of the state of Rhode Island for the purpose of supporting the Jewish synagogue in that state; in special trust to be appropriated to that object in such manner as the said legislature, together with the municipal authority of the town of Newport, may from time to time direct and appoint’:</p>

<p class="p6"><b>“§ 1.</b> Be it enacted by the general assembly, and by the authority thereof it is enacted, That said legacy and trust be and hereby are accepted by the general assembly; and the general treasurer is authorized and directed to apply for and receive from said executor the said legacy or donation of ten thousand dollars ($10,000), to give all proper receipts and acquittances therefor upon receipt thereof, and as soon as possible to vest the same entire in the stocks of some substantial bank or banks, or in some of the United States stocks; and thereafter cause the same to be invested by the state investment commission in accordance with the prudent investor rule and the certificates or evidences of such stock shall be carefully kept by said general treasurer in his or her office or by a custodian. It shall be the duty of said general treasurer once in every year to report to the general assembly the state of said fund.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>“§ 2.</b> And be it further enacted, that the city council of Newport may, and it shall be their duty to cause all repairs to be made, which in their opinions shall be necessary and proper, upon said Jewish synagogue, upon the walls enclosing the Jewish burying ground in Newport appertaining to the synagogue, and thereafter, so far as funds may be available, to apply the same toward the maintenance of that part of the synagogue premises known as the community building and to pay such other expenses as said city council may deem necessary and proper, the total expenditures herein authorized, however, not to exceed in any twelve (12) month period, four and one-half percent (41/2%) of the value of the Abraham Touro fund as measured on March 31 of each such period; provided, that all said expenditures shall be first approved by the president or vice president and by the secretary or treasurer of the board of officers of the Congregation Jeshuat Israel, worshiping in said synagogue, and by any one (1) of the trustees selected by said congregation under the provisions of § 7 of this act; and whenever there shall be no person of the Jewish persuasion residing in Newport and qualified and authorized to have the care and superintendence of said synagogue, said council shall appoint some suitable person or persons for that purpose, with such compensation as said council with the approbation of the general assembly, shall think reasonable; and provided, further, that nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize said city council or any other person whatever in any manner to interfere with or restrain the full and free exercise of the Jewish religion in said synagogue by any individual of that faith residing in Newport, or to interrupt the possession, control and management with which the proprietors of said synagogue and premises, or any other persons according to the laws and customs of the Jews, may be vested.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>“§ 3.</b> And be it further enacted, that it shall be the duty of said city council, from time to time as occasion shall present, to recommend to the general assembly such measures and provisions as in their opinion shall be best calculated to promote and fulfill the object and intention of the donor, the said Touro, as expressed in his said will, in supporting and advancing said Jewish institution.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>“§ 4.</b> And be it further enacted that the city council of Newport be, and they are hereby authorized from time to time, as occasion may require, to draw on the general treasurer in each twelve (12) month period, an amount not to exceed in any such period four and one half percent (41/2%) of the value of the Abraham Touro fund as measured on March 31 of each such period, to pay for the expenditures authorized under § 2 hereof, and that said council shall make detailed report of their expenditures to the general assembly annually at the January session.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>“§ 5.</b> The state investment commission shall have the care and management of this fund, with full power to regulate the custody and safekeeping of all moneys and evidences of property belonging thereto; it shall invest, subject to its order, to the use of this fund, all dividends, interest, or income arising therefrom in accordance with the prudent investor rule, and it may sell and dispose of any or all of such investments so made, when necessary to meet the draft of the city council of Newport as provided in § 4 of this act.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>“§ 6.</b> The general treasurer is authorized and directed to expend the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) out of the Abraham Touro fund towards the purchase of a parcel of land in the city of Newport and the construction of a building and other improvements thereon to be used in connection with the Jewish synagogue in said city.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>“§ 7.</b> The title to the said premises and the improvements thereon shall be vested in five (5) trustees, consisting of the general treasurer of the state of Rhode Island, the mayor of the city of Newport, and three (3) other persons to be selected by the Congregation Jeshuat Israel, a religious and educational corporation created under the laws of the state of Rhode Island, and now worshiping in said synagogue.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>“§ 8.</b> The selection of the trustees set forth in § 7 shall be subject to the approval of the superior court of the state of Rhode Island, and they shall hold the said premises for all time hereafter in accordance with the provisions, objects and purposes expressed in the said last will and testament of said Abraham Touro, deceased.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>“§ 10.</b> Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 9 of title 35 to the contrary, on or after July 1, 1995, the president or vice president and the secretary or the treasurer of the board of officers of the Congregation Jeshuat Israel worshipping in said synagogue are hereby authorized from time to time, as occasion may require, to draw on the general treasurer in each twelve (12) month period, an amount not to exceed in any such period four and one-half percent (41/2%) of the value of the Abraham Touro fund as measured on March 31 of each such period to pay for expenditures authorized by said Congregation in conformance with its charter and bylaws, without the necessity of first obtaining the approval of the city council of Newport.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The purpose of this chapter is to authorize and implement a system of financial planning which would allow the university of Rhode Island (the “university”) to more accurately match revenues and expenditures for externally funded research programs for each fiscal year. The general assembly has found and hereby declares that it is in the public interest to encourage independent research activity at the university and further that it is essential to the financial well being of the state and the university that revenues from externally funded research programs be allocated to the fiscal years in which they accrue and be matched to the expenditures for the programs that are incurred for that fiscal year. The general assembly has further found that under the present system revenues are often received after the close of the fiscal year although the expenditures to which they are matched were incurred prior to the close of the fiscal year, and that, in fact, under certain programs, funds must be expended and then reimbursement sought from the contracting agency at a later date, often after the close of the fiscal year.</p>

<p class="p4"><b>35-13-3.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The code provides that interest with respect to certain obligations may not be exempt from federal income taxation unless they are in registered form. It is therefore a matter of state concern that public entities be authorized to provide for the issuance of obligations in registered form. It is a purpose of this chapter to empower all public entities to establish and maintain a system pursuant to which obligations may be issued in registered form within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the code.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Obligations have traditionally been issued in bearer rather than in registered form, and a change from bearer to registered form may affect the relationships, rights, and duties of issuers of and the persons that deal with obligations, and by this effect, the costs. These effects will impact the various issuers and varieties of obligations differently depending on their legal and financial characteristics, their markets, and their adaptability to recent and prospective technological and organizational developments. It is therefore a matter of state concern that public entities be provided flexibility in the development of systems of registration and control over system incidents, so as to accommodate these differing impacts. It is a purpose of this chapter to empower the establishment and maintenance, and amendment from time to time, of differing systems of registration of obligations, including system incidents, so as to accommodate the differing impacts upon issuers and varieties of obligations. It is further a purpose of this chapter to authorize systems that will facilitate the prompt and accurate transfer of registered public obligations and the developing of practices with regard to the registration and transfer of registered public obligations.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Each issuer is authorized to establish and maintain a system of registration with respect to each obligation which it issues. The system may be a system pursuant to which (1) only certificated registered public obligations are issued; (2) only uncertificated registered public obligations are issued; or (3) both certificated and uncertificated registered public obligations are issued. The issuer may amend, discontinue, and reinstitute any system, from time to time, subject to covenants.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The system shall be established, amended, discontinued, or reinstituted for the issuer and shall be maintained for the issuer as provided by the official or official body.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The system shall be described in the registered public obligation or in the official actions which provide for original issuance of the registered public obligation, and in subsequent official actions providing for amendments and other matters from time to time. The description may be by reference to a program of the issuer which is established by the official or official body.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The system shall define the method or methods by which transfer of the registered public obligation shall be effective with respect to the issuer, and by which payment of principal and any interest shall be made. The system may permit the issuance of registered public obligations in any denomination to represent several registered public obligations of smaller denominations.

In order to achieve these ends it is important that Rhode Island citizens be provided with an investment opportunity to enhance their financial access to institutions of higher education and access to housing within this state. It is the intent of the general assembly to provide the people of the state with an alternative method of saving for the purpose of encouraging enrollment in institutions of higher education and for the purpose of encouraging the purchase of residential dwellings within the state.</p>

<p class="p6">In order to provide the people of the state: (1) with access to institutions of higher education; and (2) the financial means to purchase residential housing; there shall be issued with all bonds of the state, authorized by the provisions of the general obligation bond acts, savings bonds in such amounts as determined by the general treasurer with the approval of the governor. Bonds to be issued and sold as savings bonds shall be designated by the governor and the general treasurer as “general obligation savings bonds” in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds, and shall be subject to all of the terms and provisions of the general obligation bond acts, except as provided in §§ 35-15-5 and 35-15-6 and except that savings bonds may bear interest payable at such time or times, and may be sold in such a manner, and as may be determined by the governor and the general treasurer. Savings bonds may be sold at a negotiated sale if the governor and general treasurer determine that a negotiated sale will result in either a more efficient and economic sale of the savings bonds or greater access to the savings bonds by residents in the state. If any savings bonds are sold at a negotiated sale, the underwriter or underwriters to which the bonds are sold shall, in the judgment of the general treasurer, have sufficient capability to make a broad distribution of the bonds to investors resident in the state. The aggregate original principal amount of the bonds will be the sole and exclusive test for determining whether general obligation bonds have been issued in the amounts approved by the vote of the people in the general obligation bond acts. In making these determinations, the interest component of the savings bonds shall be disregarded.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Notwithstanding any other provision of general law to the contrary, any department or agency as defined in chapter 1 of this title, or other unit of state or local government delineated in this section, which is required or authorized to receive or collect any payments to state government, may be authorized, but not required, to accept credit card payments of such amounts and in such manner as may be prescribed or limited by this chapter. Any such department, agency or other governmental unit receiving approval from the director of the department of administration pursuant to this chapter shall be known as an “authorized department or agency.”</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the director of the department of administration shall establish procedures, in consultation with the state controller and general treasurer, by which: (i) a department, agency or other governmental unit may be approved as an authorized department or agency; (ii) specific fees, charges, taxes, tuition or other payments to state or local government may be approved for payment by credit card by an authorized department or agency; and (iii) the manner of acceptance of credit card payments is established. Factors which may be considered in making such determinations or establishing such procedures may include, but are not necessarily limited to, improved governmental cash flow, reduction of governmental overhead costs, improved governmental financial security, the benefit of increased public convenience or a combination of one or more of the foregoing.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> For purposes of this section, the term “credit card” shall be deemed to include credit cards, charge cards, debit cards, electronic funds transfers or similar means of automatic transmission of funds.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The state controller and general treasurer are jointly authorized to enter into appropriate agreements with credit card issuers, financial institutions or other appropriate parties as needed to facilitate the acceptance of credit card payments pursuant to this chapter. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such agreements may provide for the acceptance of credit card payments at a discount from their face amount or the payment or withholding of administrative fees from the face amount of such payments, provided such payment or discount does not exceed a commercially reasonable percentage of the face amount of such payment as may be determined by the state controller and general treasurer. Any such agreement shall provide that it may be canceled at any time, but the agreement may include provisions for a reasonable brief period of notice for cancellation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> No person making any payment by credit card shall be relieved from liability for the underlying obligation except to the extent that the state realizes final payment of the underlying obligation in cash or the equivalent. If final payment is not made by the credit card issuer or other guarantor of payment in the credit card transaction, then the underlying obligation shall survive and the state shall retain all remedies for enforcement which would have applied if the credit card transaction had not occurred. No contract may modify the provisions of this subsection. This subsection, however, shall not make the underlying obligor liable for any discount or administrative fees paid to the credit card issuer or other party by the state, except with child support payments. Credit cards shall only be accepted for child support payments if a means is established to ensure that the full amount of the child support payment made by credit card is received by the recipient and that state revenue is not used to pay any fee charged by the credit card company for the child support payment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> A state officer or employee who accepts a credit card payment in accordance with this section and any applicable procedures, policies, rules, or regulations of the state shall not thereby incur any personal liability for the final collection of such payments.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> This section shall be broadly construed to authorize, but not require, acceptance of credit card payments by authorized departments or agencies. The decision as to whether to utilize credit card payments for any particular type of payment may be made by the authorized department or agency, subject to this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> Credit card account numbers in the possession of a state or local government are confidential and shall not be deemed public records.</p>

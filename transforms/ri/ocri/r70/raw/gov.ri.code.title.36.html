<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Whereas the legislature in the January 1951 session established a department of administration and in article II thereof created a “merit system of personnel administration” and a division of personnel administration within the department, it is apparent the intent was to establish an organization which would be more effective in securing qualified personnel for the classified service of the state than had been the case under the civil service department as created in chapter 661 of the Public Laws of 1939. To further clarify that intent and to provide for its accomplishment, there is proposed a restatement of chapter 661 and certain amendments thereto with proposed changes which will provide the authority necessary to attain the desired objectives.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The purpose of this chapter and chapter 4 of this title is to guarantee to all citizens a fair and reasonable opportunity for public service, to establish conditions of service which will attract officers and employees of character and capacity, and to increase the efficiency of the governmental departments and agencies by the improvement of methods of personnel administration.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The general assembly finds: that new trends in the use of alternative work schedules in the private sector have proven beneficial to employee and employer alike; that the congress of the United States has recently enacted and the president has signed legislation lending permanence to what had been heretofore an experimental program of alternative work schedules for federal employees; that it has been determined that alternative work schedules provide greater employment opportunities for women with young children; that the fastest growing segment of the work force is the “permanent part-time” work force; that alternative work schedules present greater job opportunity for the unemployed; that many of the fifty (50) states now offer alternative work schedules to their state employees and that the use of alternative work schedules result in improvement in service to the public, employee morale, and efficiency of agency operations. The general assembly therefore finds that there should be optional alternate working schedules available to state employees.</p>

<p class="p6">It is the policy of the state to offer alternative working schedules to state employees, thereby enabling the appointing authority to allow for flexitime, compressed workweeks, job sharing, permanent part-time, and other alternative work plans, provided work schedule changes allow the maintaining of adequate work coverage and service to the public, in an effort to reduce commuter congestion, conserve energy, increase employee morale, increase productivity, and reduce tardiness and absenteeism. Any alternative work plans to insure compliance shall be jointly agreed to by the appointing authority and the certified bargaining representative.</p>

Any resident denied admission to an examination on the grounds of insufficient qualifications as established in the class specifications involved may, within five (5) calendar days of the mailing of the notices, appeal in writing to the administrator of adjudication for a hearing or review of the denial. On the basis of the review or hearing, the administrator of adjudication may direct the personnel administrator to permit the appellant to take the examination. The tests may take into consideration elements of character, education, aptitude, experience, knowledge, skill, personality, physical fitness, professional license, or specialized training, and other pertinent matters, and may be written, oral, physical, or in the form of demonstration of skill, or any combination of these types.

The final earned rating of each person competing in any test shall be determined by the weighted average of the earned rating on all phases of the test according to weights for each phase established by the personnel administrator in advance of the giving of the tests and published as part of the announcement of the examination. However, the personnel administrator may discontinue the examination process for any competitor when it has been determined that the required minimum final earned rating cannot be attained. All persons competing in any test shall be given written notice of their standing on any employment list or of their failure to attain a place upon the list. The personnel administrator may as deemed appropriate establish broadband examinations for a wide variety of entry and/or other levels of positions which would not be ranked in the traditional manner. The examinations would be ranked only upon certification to an appropriate vacancy and subject to conditions established in the personnel rules and the provisions of §§ 36-4-4 and 36-4-7 shall not apply to any appointments which are in the unclassified service. When an appropriate vacancy exists, the appointing authority will certify as to the appropriate knowledge, skills, and abilities required for successful performance in a particular position or positions. The personnel administrator will then proceed to rank all eligibles who have qualified and possess the requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>Nondelegable Mandate.</b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a state official had no power to accede to the payment of overtime benefits via a method of computation that included paid sick-leave time being counted as hours worked, since both state law and the relevant collective bargaining agreement (CBA) had removed that from the bargaining table, neither he nor the human services agency had the power to modify the statutory obligations of the parties to the CBA and bind the state to a course of conduct that was illegal.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Superior Court correctly ruled that an arbitrator exceeded his authority by awarding overtime pay based on a computation which included sick-leave hours as hours worked, since such an award not only manifestly disregarded the applicable terms of the workers’ compensation statute, but also overrode those provisions in the parties’ own collective bargaining agreement that barred such a result.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> <b>Findings:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rhode Island is dedicated to environmental protection, efficient use of resources, sound fiscal policy, and sustainable development. Reducing vehicle miles traveled for commuting to work can lead to reductions in air pollution emissions, greenhouse gases, energy consumption, road congestion, and parking shortages. Reduced vehicle miles traveled would also lead to lower total motor fuel consumption, keeping more energy dollars that now flow out-of-state available in the state for local consumption and investment; a state government plan to reduce “drive alone” commuting and an increase in carpooling, transit use, and walk-to-work modes is required. State government, as a major employer can lead by example in promoting alternative forms of travel that can reduce vehicle miles traveled.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The department of administration shall set up a committee on state employee transportation which shall consist of the directors of the department of administration, RIDOT, RIDEM, RIDOH and statewide planning, or their designees, the general manager of RIPTA or designee, and a representative from a state employee union, to develop, publicize, and implement a plan to give incentives to state employees to reduce vehicle miles in commuting to work. The committee will investigate employee incentives for reducing commuting vehicle miles offered by other public bodies around the country, investigate practices developed by the environmental protection agency’s “Best Workplaces for Commuters Program”, consider the implementation of carpool, telecommuting, guaranteed-ride-home, bike-to-work and walk-to-work programs, and incorporate or adopt those ideas deemed appropriate for Rhode Island into the plan. The plan shall include, but is not limited to, a means for determining base year values of the proportion of single occupant vehicle commute trips and the commute trip vehicle miles traveled per employee and progress toward meeting commute trip reduction plan goals on an annual basis. The goals of miles traveled per employee for all state agencies shall not be less than fifteen percent (15%) reduction from the base year value by January 1, 2012, twenty-five percent (25%) reduction from the base year values by January 1, 2014, and thirty-five percent (35%) reduction from the base year values by January 1, 2016. The plan will also include an offer of a RIPTA transit pass to employees in lieu of parking privileges.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The director of the department of administration shall report annually to the governor and the committee as to the progress being made to meet the goals.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> <b>Intent.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is intended that the retirement system satisfy the requirements of § 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended from time to time, 26 U.S.C. § 401 (hereinafter referred to as the “code”), in form and operation, to the extent that those requirements apply to a governmental plan described in § 414(d) of the code, 26 U.S.C. § 414. To this end, the following provisions shall be applicable, administered, and interpreted in a manner consistent with maintaining the tax qualification of the retirement system, and shall supersede any conflicting provisions of chapters 8 — 10 of this title, of chapter 16 of title 16, or of chapter 21 of title 45.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> <b>Exclusive benefit.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All funds of the retirement systems shall be held in one or more trusts, in one or more custodial accounts treated as trusts in accordance with § 401(f) of the code, or in a combination thereof. Under any trust or custodial account, it shall be impossible at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to employees and their beneficiaries, for any part of the corpus or income to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than the payment of retirement allowances and other pension benefits to employees and their beneficiaries. However, this requirement shall not prohibit: (1) the return of a contribution within six (6) months after the executive director determines that the contribution was made by a mistake of fact; or (2) the payment of expenses of the retirement system in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> <b>Vesting on plan termination.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the event of the termination (within the meaning of the code) of the retirement system, the accrued benefits of eligible employees shall become fully and immediately vested but only to the extent those benefits are already funded.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> <b>Forfeitures.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Credits forfeited by an employee pursuant to § 36-10-8, § 16-16-31, or § 45-21-28 shall not be applied to increase the benefits of any other employee.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> <b>Required distributions.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Distributions shall begin to be made not later than the employee’s required beginning date as defined under § 401(a)(9) of the code and shall be made in accordance with all other requirements of that code section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> <b>Limitation on benefits.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Benefits shall not be payable to the extent that they exceed the limitations imposed by § 415 of the code, 26 U.S.C. § 415, as adjusted from time to time pursuant to § 415(d) of the code. In no event shall the member receive a retirement benefit in any year that exceeds the limitations set forth in § 415(b).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> <b>Limitation on compensation.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Benefits and contributions shall not be computed with reference to any compensation that exceeds the maximum dollar amount permitted by § 401(a)(17) of the code as adjusted for increases in the cost-of-living. This provision shall take effect July 1, 1994, and shall apply only with respect to an employee who first becomes a member of the retirement system on or after that date.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> <b>Actuarial determination.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whenever the amount of any employee’s benefit is to be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions done by a professional actuary, those assumptions shall be specified by resolution of the retirement board.</p>

<p class="p6">The general assembly finds that the State faces a significant unfunded liability associated with its retiree health care benefits programs. To date, the State has been funding retiree health care benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis. Recently established governmental accounting standards applicable to the State require that the State account for such unfunded costs on an accrued actuarial basis. An actuarial study conducted by the State shows that the State faces an unfunded future liability for retiree health care benefits in excess of six hundred million dollars ($600,000,000). The creation and eventual funding of a dedicated trust fund for the purpose of financing this liability on accrued actuarial basis is fiscally prudent and will produce significant benefits to the State.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Representation Before Agency.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a declaratory judgment action brought by a town against a school committee, it was held on appeal that the school committee was prohibited from retaining independent counsel for its legal matters and was required to have the town solicitor handle its legal matters, with the town solicitor having the authority to decline representation if ethical considerations warranted. The appellate court also held that the school committee was a department of the town and, therefore, was required to abide by the town’s charter, which required all legal matters for any of the town’s departments, agencies, or offices to be handled by the town solicitor. Town of Johnston v. Santilli, 892 A.2d 123, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 30 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p8"><b>Confidential Information.</b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is a fact-specific statute. The mere act of a chief of police belonging to a local police bargaining unit would not implicate subsection (d). Instead, there must be specific articulable facts indicating that a police chief has actually misused his or her public office or has divulged confidential information garnered through his or her official position for a transgression of subsection (d) to occur. Town of Lincoln v. Lincoln Lodge No. 22, 660 A.2d 710, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 178 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p8"><b>Conflicting Financial Interest.</b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a member of a state agency becomes aware that business in which such member has a financial interest will come before the agency, the appropriate response of such member is to recuse himself or herself from participation in such business or voting thereon. Mehrtens v. Davis, 574 A.2d 1236, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 109 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 36-14-5 prohibits government officials from accepting outside employment impairing “independence of judgment,” but this apparently does not restrict state legislators from private employment involving contact with courts or agencies. Thus, a state senator could have been openly paid by a medical center to advocate with local officials. United States v. Urciuoli, 513 F.3d 290, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 1049 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><b>Constitutional Protection of Citizens’ Complaints.</b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The first amendment protection of expression on public issues encompasses citizens’ complaints that public officials, be they elected, appointed, or employed, have breached contemporary canons of ethics in government. Providence Journal Co. v. Newton, 723 F. Supp. 846, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12854 (D.R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The confidentiality provisions of the Rhode Island Code of Ethics impose unconstitutional restraints on the free speech rights of a citizen who files an ethics complaint against a mayor and members of a city council; public discussion of the existence and substance of an ethics complaint formally filed under oath against a public official is speech protected by the first amendment. Providence Journal Co. v. Newton, 723 F. Supp. 846, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12854 (D.R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p8"><b>Constitutionality of Subsections (n) and (o).</b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The revolving-door legislation of subsections (n) and (o) passes constitutional equal-protection muster, since the legislation is rationally related to a legitimate state interest in protecting the public by preventing public officials from taking advantage of their positions by securing employment in a related entity for one year. In re Advisory from the Governor, 633 A.2d 664, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 232 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The presumption contained in the revolving-door legislation of subsections (n) and (o) is either rebuttable, temporary, or both. Consequently the revolving-door legislation does not violate due process because it does not contain an irrebuttable presumption. In re Advisory from the Governor, 633 A.2d 664, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 232 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsections (n) and (o) do not contain any language that vests the legislature with any appointment power. Consequently the legislature has not, directly or indirectly, assumed any essential power of the governor. Thus, subsections (n) and (o) do not violate the separation of powers doctrine. In re Advisory from the Governor, 633 A.2d 664, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 232 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p8"><b>Contract Award Valid.</b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice erred in upholding the commission’s finding that former governor violated this section by awarding state contract to an engineering firm owned by significant campaign contributor, where the record was deficient of reliable, probative evidence to support the proposition that governor had a reasonable belief in, or expectation of, monetary gain as a result of his selection of contributor’s firm. DiPrete v. Morsilli, 635 A.2d 1155, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 7 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p8"><b>Ethics Commission Regulations.</b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, via subsections (n) and (o), is not inconsistent with Ethics Commission Regulations 36-14-5006 and 36-14-5007. In re Advisory from the Governor, 633 A.2d 664, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 232 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p8"><b>Evaluation Standard.</b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The issue of whether a particular application of §§ 28-9.2-3 and 28-9.2-5 violates a constitutional imperative or a provision of the Ethics Code, this chapter, must be evaluated with the same factors used in analyzing violations of the directive of R.I. Const., art. III, § 7 that public officials and employees avoid the appearance of impropriety. Town of Lincoln v. Lincoln Lodge No. 22, 660 A.2d 710, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 178 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p8"><b>Improper Contract Award.</b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former governor, as a result of awarding a state contract for litigation over public works construction to a law firm partly owned by governor’s business associate, was properly found by the commission to have violated subsections (a) and (d), and was properly fined $10,000 for this violation. DiPrete v. Morsilli, 635 A.2d 1155, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 7 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p8"><b>Invalid Town Council Resolution.</b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where members of a town council passed, unanimously and without discussion, a resolution requesting the general assembly to amend the town charter to provide the members $100.00 for expenses each month and eliminating a provision that expressly provided that council members would “receive no reimbursement for expenses,” the commission’s and the trial justice’s findings that their actions violated § 36-14-4(a) of the conflict-of-interest law (now subsection (a) ) and the requirements of § 36-14-5 (now § 36-14-6), which provides for the filing of a report with the commission when the institution of an action can reasonably be expected to result in profit to the official taking that action, were supported by the evidence. Celona v. Rhode Island Ethics Comm'n, 544 A.2d 582, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 115 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p8"><b>Legislative Lobbying.</b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the plaintiff agreed to serve as a representative for bottlers within a year of leaving public office, registered as a legislative agent, attended senate sessions and appeared on the floor wearing his legislative lobby tag, initiated telephone conferences with state senators, prepared letters of information that were distributed to senators, arranged at least two dinners between state senators and representatives of the soft-drink industry, and admitted in his billings that he was serving as a legislative agent, the fact that he did not formally appear on behalf of the bottlers in making any committee presentations to the senate did not alter the fact that he violated the revolving-door legislation. DiLuglio v. Rhode Island Ethics Comm'n, 726 A.2d 1149, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 77 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p8"><b>Representation Before Agency.</b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A member of the Rhode Island Mobile and Manufactured Home Commission is barred from representing themselves or others before that commission. Treaster v. Rhode Island Mobile &amp; Manufactured Home Comm'n, 644 A.2d 314, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 215 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subdivision (e)(2) does not expressly prohibit representation of an individual or entity before an agency with which the lawyer is not associated, nor does it prohibit representation of a private party in a matter in which the state has a substantial interest. Gray v. Rhode Island Dep't of Children, Youth &amp; Families, 937 F. Supp. 153, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13236 (D.R.I. 1996).</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A fine assessed against a former mayor by the commission for violations of the Code of Ethics may represent punishment to the extent that it would bar a subsequent prosecution for criminal acts under double jeopardy analysis, if the fine is not merely remedial but also serves a retributive or deterrent purpose.

<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> The deadline for filing any statement required by this section is 5:00 p.m. of the last day designated in the pertinent subsection of this section for filing the statement.

Any statement required by any provision of this section to be filed within a specified time period shall be deemed to be timely filed if it is placed in the United States post office or in the hands of a common or contract carrier properly addressed to the appropriate authority within the time limits applicable to the statement. The postmark or receipt mark (if received by a common or contract carrier) will be prima facie evidence of the date that the statement was deposited with the post office or carrier.

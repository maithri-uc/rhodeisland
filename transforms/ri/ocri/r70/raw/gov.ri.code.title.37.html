All documents submitted in response to the bid proposal are public pursuant to chapter 38-2 upon opening of the bids. The invitation for bids shall state that each bidder must submit a copy of their bid proposal to be available for public inspection upon the opening of the bids. The burden to identify and withhold from the public copy that is released at the bid opening any trade secrets, commercial or financial information, or other information the bidder deems not subject to public disclosure pursuant to chapter 38-2, the Access to Public Records Act, shall rest with the bidder submitting the bid proposal.</p>

The purchasing agent shall issue a written determination as to whether the subject bid is nonresponsive addressing each assertion in the objection and shall provide a copy of the determination to the objector and all those who submitted bids at least seven (7) business days prior to the award of the contract. If a bid is nonresponsive to the requirements in the invitation to bid, the bid is invalid and the purchasing agent shall reject the bid. The purchasing agent shall have no discretion to waive any requirements in the invitation to bid which are identified as mandatory.

<p class="p6">It is hereby found by the general assembly as follows:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> In imposing sanctions on Iran, the United States Congress and the President of the United States have determined that the illicit nuclear activities of Iran, combined with its development of unconventional weapons and ballistic missiles, and its support of international terrorism, represent a serious threat to the security of the United States and its allies around the world.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly called attention to Iran’s unlawful nuclear activities, and as a result, the United Nations Security Council has adopted four (4) rounds of sanctions designed to compel the government of Iran to cease those activities and comply with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, commonly known as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The human rights situation in Iran has steadily deteriorated since the fraudulent elections of 2009, as evidenced by the brutal repression, torture, murder and arbitrary detention of peaceful protestors, dissidents and minorities.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> On July 1, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, which expressly authorizes state and local governments to prevent investment in, including prohibiting entry into or renewing contracts with, companies operating in Iran and includes provisions that preclude companies that do business in Iran from contracting with the United States government.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> It is the intention of the general assembly to implement this authority granted under Section 202 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> There are moral and reputational reasons for state and local governments to not engage in business with foreign companies that have business activities benefiting foreign states, such as Iran, that pursue illegal nuclear programs, support acts of terrorism and commit violations of human rights.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> Short-term economic profits cannot be a justification to circumvent even in spirit those international sanctions designed to thwart Iran from developing nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(8)</b> The concerns of this general assembly regarding Iran are strictly the result of the actions of the government of Iran and should not be construed as enmity toward the Iranian people.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Each employer of fifty (50) persons or more, located within one-quarter (1/4) of a mile of Rhode Island public transit service who provides a parking subsidy to employees, shall offer a parking cash-out program. “Parking cash-out program” means an employer-funded program under which an employer offers to provide a RIPTA monthly transit pass to an employee instead of the parking subsidy that the employer would otherwise pay to provide the employee with a parking space.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> A parking cash-out program may include a requirement that employee participants certify that they will comply with guidelines established by the employer designed to avoid neighborhood parking problems, with a provision that employees not complying with the guidelines will no longer be eligible for the parking cash-out program.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> “Employee” means an employee of an employer subject to this section;</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Subsection (a) shall not apply to any employer who, on or before August 1, 2003, has leased employee parking, until the expiration of that lease or unless the lease permits the employer to reduce, without penalty, the number of parking spaces subject to the lease.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> It is the intent of the general assembly, in enacting this section, that cash-out requirements shall apply only to employers who can reduce, without penalty, the number of paid parking spaces they maintain for the use of their employees and instead provide their employees the monthly transit pass described in this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Any city or town in which a commercial development will implement a parking cash-out program may grant to that development an appropriate reduction in the parking requirements otherwise in effect for new development. At the request of an existing commercial development that has implemented a parking cash-out program, the city or town may grant an appropriate reduction in the parking requirements otherwise applicable, based on the demonstrated reduced need for parking, and the space no longer needed for parking purposes may be used for other appropriate purposes.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The project owner and prime contractor shall fulfill their obligations pursuant to subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section in good faith and in a timely manner. Except where the contract for construction shall provide for an earlier submission, following the expiration of sixty (60) days after substantial completion or, in the case of a dispute under subsection (c), final and binding resolution of the dispute, a person may submit a written application for payment of retainage in the form required by the person’s contract for construction. An application for payment of retainage shall be accompanied by a written list identifying the incomplete or defective work items and deliverables on its received list that the person has completed, repaired, and delivered.

The writing shall be certified as made in good faith. A person may submit additional applications for payment of retainage in the form required by the person’s contract for construction following completion or correction of incomplete or defective work items, the furnishing of deliverables, or the resolution of claims.

<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> Retainage held by the project owner on account of the prime contractor’s self-performed labor, materials, and equipment shall be eligible for payment to the same extent as if the labor, materials, and equipment had been provided by a person under a contract for construction with the prime contractor.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> If the prime contractor has not been declared in default under the requirements of the contract for construction with the project owner and subject to this section, the project owner shall not withhold any part of the retainage of a person under a contract for construction with the prime contractor or the prime contractor’s proportional retainage calculated thereon for a claim that the project owner asserts against the prime contractor that is not based on the performance of the person or a default of the person’s contract for construction.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> A contract for construction may establish the date of the month for submission of an application for payment of retainage; provided, however, that the contract may not restrict the submission to less frequently than one application per calendar month. An application submitted prior to the date established in the contract for construction shall be deemed submitted as of the date established in the contract. A rejection of an application for payment of retainage and a dispute regarding incomplete or defective work items, deliverables, or claims shall be subject to the applicable dispute resolution procedure. A provision in a contract for construction that requires a person to delay commencement of the applicable dispute resolution procedure for more than thirty (30) days after either the rejection of an application for payment of retainage or written notice of the dispute is provided, whichever first occurs, shall be void and unenforceable. The payment of retainage shall be subject to subsection (e).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(j)</b> A communication required by this section to be in writing may be submitted in electronic form and by electronic means.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(k)</b> A provision in a contract for construction that purports to waive, limit, or subvert this section or redefine or expand the conditions for achievement of substantial completion for payment of retainage shall be void and unenforceable.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(l)</b> Any contract under this section, as defined by § 37-13-1, that exceeds twelve (12) months in duration shall allow those subcontractors who are substantially complete within the first third (1/3) of the project to request from the prime contractor release of retainage pursuant to subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> “All claims, disputes, and other matters in question arising out of or relating to this contract or the performance or interpretation thereof shall be submitted to arbitration. Arbitration shall be commenced by a demand in writing made by one party to the contract upon the other within a reasonable time after the dispute, claim, or other matter in question arose but in no event after payment in full of the contract price has been made and accepted. The written demand shall contain a statement of the question to be arbitrated and a detailed statement of each item or matter in dispute and the name of the arbitrator appointed by that party. The other party to the contract within ten (10) days of the receipt of the written demand shall appoint an arbitrator and give notice in writing thereof to the party who commenced arbitration. The two (2) arbitrators appointed by the parties shall within ten (10) days of the date of the appointment of the second arbitrator select a third arbitrator who shall be designated as chairperson and who immediately shall give written notice to the parties of his or her appointment. The third arbitrator shall select a time, date, and place for hearing and give each party five (5) days notice in writing thereof. The date for hearing shall not be more than fifteen (15) days after the date of appointment of the third arbitrator. The award shall be made promptly by the arbitrators and, unless otherwise agreed by the parties or specified by law, no later than thirty (30) days from the date of closing the hearing, or, if oral hearings have been waived, from the date of the transmittal of the final statements and proofs to the arbitrators. The award shall be in writing and shall be signed by a majority of the arbitrators. It shall be executed in the manner required by law. The arbitrator shall provide a written explanation of the reasoning for the award. In the event the party of whom arbitration is demanded shall fail to appoint his or her arbitrator within the time specified or the two (2) arbitrators appointed by the parties are unable to agree on an appointment of the third arbitrator within the time specified, either party may petition the presiding justice of the superior court to appoint a single arbitrator who shall hear the parties and make an award as provided herein. The petitioner shall give five (5) days notice in writing to the other party before filing his or her petition.”</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Any dispute involving claims less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and associated with construction of a highway or bridge as referred to in subsection (b) shall be submitted to arbitration. Any dispute involving claims of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more and associated with construction of a highway or bridge as referred to in subsection (b) shall only be arbitrated with the consent of the parties. If the parties fail to consent to arbitration and the state of Rhode Island is a party to the dispute, then the claim will proceed in accordance with § 37-13.1-1.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> For the purposes of this section, the term “claims” shall not mean the aggregate amount sought under the contract or in the arbitration, but shall refer specifically to each item or matter in dispute for which additional compensation is sought or for each item for which a credit is sought.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Notwithstanding subsection (a) or (b) of this section, if any contract except for highway and bridge contracts provides for an arbitration procedure, and a method of appointment of an arbitrator or arbitrators, that method shall be followed instead of the method provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>

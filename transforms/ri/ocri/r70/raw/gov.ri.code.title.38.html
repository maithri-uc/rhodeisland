<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The public’s right to access to public records and the individual’s right to dignity and privacy are both recognized to be principles of the utmost importance in a free society. The purpose of this chapter is to facilitate public access to public records. It is also the intent of this chapter to protect from disclosure information about particular individuals maintained in the files of public bodies when disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The underlying policy of the Access to Public Records Act favors the free flow and disclosure of information to the public. However, the Legislature did not intend to empower the press and the public with carte blanche to demand all records held by public agencies. Providence Journal Co. v. Sundlun, 616 A.2d 1131, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 208 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Financial or commercial information provided to the government on a voluntary basis is confidential for the purpose of the statute covering public access to records if it is of a kind that would customarily not be released to the public by the person from whom it was obtained. Providence Journal Co. v. Convention Ctr. Auth., 774 A.2d 40, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 168 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Civil contempt order was properly refused to a community action group in its action against a city police chief pursuant to the Access to Public Records Act (APRA), R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 38, ch. 2; there was no clear and convincing evidence that the chief intentionally violated any decree or order in the action. Direct Action for Rights &amp; Equal. v. Gannon, 819 A.2d 651, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 90 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice correctly decided that an officer of a water transport company could not assert that the information sought as to whether the company intended to offer high-speed water ferry service was confidential and exempt from disclosure under the Rhode Island Access to Public Records Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 38-2-1. Interstate Navigation Co. v. Div. of Pub. Utils. &amp; Carriers of R.I., 824 A.2d 1282, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 167 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Access to Public Records Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 38-2-1 et seq., provided a remedy only to those people who were denied access to public records; it did not provide a remedy to prevent public agencies from disclosing records; therefore, a gas company trying to prevent a public utilities commission from disclosing information submitted to the commission in a rate case was not an aggrieved party, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-5-1, and a court had no subject matter jurisdiction to review the commission’s decision to release the information. In re New Eng. Gas Co., 842 A.2d 545, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 42 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission’s rules concerning disclosure require it to consider public requests for records in its possession according to the provisions of the Access to Public Records Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 38-2-1 et seq., as access to public records shall be granted in accordance with the Access to Public Records Act, under R.I. Pub. Util. Comm’n R. 1.2(g)(1), and even a preliminary finding that some documents are privileged do not preclude the Commission’s release of those documents pursuant to a public request in accordance with R.I. Gen. Laws § 38-2-1 et seq., under R.I. Pub. Util. Comm’n R. 1.2(g)(2). In re New Eng. Gas Co., 842 A.2d 545, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 42 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As the rules of the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission make manifest, a party may request only a “preliminary finding” that submitted documents are exempt under the Access to Public Records Act (APRA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 38-2-1 et seq.; it has no ability under the rules to challenge the Commission’s decision to release the documents pursuant to a public request under the APRA. In re New Eng.

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Any reasonably segregable portion of a public record excluded by § 38-2-2(4) shall be available for public inspection after the deletion of the information which is the basis of the exclusion. If an entire document or record is deemed non-public, the public body shall state in writing that no portion of the document or record contains reasonable segregable information that is releasable.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Each public body shall make, keep, and maintain written or recorded minutes of all meetings.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Each public body shall establish written procedures regarding access to public records but shall not require written requests for public information available pursuant to § 42-35-2 or for other documents prepared for or readily available to the public.</p>
<p class="p6">These procedures must include, but need not be limited to, the identification of a designated public records officer or unit, how to make a public records request, and where a public record request should be made, and a copy of these procedures shall be posted on the public body’s website if such a website is maintained and be made otherwise readily available to the public. The unavailability of a designated public records officer shall not be deemed good cause for failure to timely comply with a request to inspect and/or copy public records pursuant to subsection (e). A written request for public records need not be made on a form established by a public body if the request is otherwise readily identifiable as a request for public records.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> A public body receiving a request shall permit the inspection or copying within ten (10) business days after receiving a request. If the inspection or copying is not permitted within ten (10) business days, the public body shall forthwith explain in writing the need for additional time to comply with the request. Any such explanation must be particularized to the specific request made. In such cases the public body may have up to an additional twenty (20) business days to comply with the request if it can demonstrate that the voluminous nature of the request, the number of requests for records pending, or the difficulty in searching for and retrieving or copying the requested records, is such that additional time is necessary to avoid imposing an undue burden on the public body.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> If a public record is in active use or in storage and, therefore, not available at the time a person or entity requests access, the custodian shall so inform the person or entity and make an appointment for the person or entity to examine such records as expeditiously as they may be made available.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> Any person or entity requesting copies of public records may elect to obtain them in any and all media in which the public agency is capable of providing them. Any public body which maintains its records in a computer storage system shall provide any data properly identified in a printout or other reasonable format, as requested.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a public body to reorganize, consolidate, or compile data not maintained by the public body in the form requested at the time the request to inspect the public records was made except to the extent that such records are in an electronic format and the public body would not be unduly burdened in providing such data.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> Nothing in this section is intended to affect the public record status of information merely because it is stored in a computer.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(j)</b> No public records shall be withheld based on the purpose for which the records are sought, nor shall a public body require, as a condition of fulfilling a public records request, that a person or entity provide a reason for the request or provide personally identifiable information about him/herself.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(k)</b> At the election of the person or entity requesting the public records, the public body shall provide copies of the public records electronically, by facsimile, or by mail in accordance with the requesting person or entity’s choice, unless complying with that preference would be unduly burdensome due to the volume of records requested or the costs that would be incurred. The person requesting delivery shall be responsible for the actual cost of delivery, if any.</p>

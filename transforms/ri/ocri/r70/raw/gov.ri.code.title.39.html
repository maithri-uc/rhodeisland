<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Preservation of the state’s resources, commerce, and industry requires the assurance of adequate public transportation and communication facilities, water supplies, and an abundance of energy, all supplied to the people with reliability, at economical cost, and with due regard for the preservation and enhancement of the environment, the conservation of natural resources, including scenic, historic, and recreational assets, and the strengthening of long-range, land-use planning.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> It is hereby declared to be the policy of the state to provide fair regulation of public utilities and carriers in the interest of the public, to promote availability of adequate, efficient, and economical energy, communication, and transportation services and water supplies to the inhabitants of the state, to provide just and reasonable rates and charges for such services and supplies, without unjust discrimination, undue preferences or advantages, or unfair or destructive competitive practices, and to cooperate with other states and agencies of the federal government in promoting and coordinating efforts to achieve realization of this policy.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> To this end, there is hereby vested in the public utilities commission and the division of public utilities and carriers the exclusive power and authority to supervise, regulate, and make orders governing the conduct of companies offering to the public in intrastate commerce energy, communication, and transportation services and water supplies for the purpose of increasing and maintaining the efficiency of the companies, according desirable safeguards and convenience to their employees and to the public, and protecting them and the public against improper and unreasonable rates, tolls, and charges by providing full, fair, and adequate administrative procedures and remedies, and by securing a judicial review to any party aggrieved by such an administrative proceeding or ruling.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Legislative Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is apparent from an examination of the enabling act that the legislature intended to establish a qualified administrative body to evaluate technical evidence, address the myriad of complex problems associated with regulatory proceedings, and render intelligent decisions. South County Gas Co. v. Burke, 551 A.2d 22, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 145 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In examining this title as a whole, it is evident that the Legislature has expressed its intent to cover the field of public-utilities regulation and has declared that the public utilities commission has exclusive power to regulate public utilities. Accordingly, a municipal ordinance regulating the construction of power lines was pre-empted by state law because it invaded a field that the state has intentionally occupied. East Greenwich v. O'Neil, 617 A.2d 104, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 209 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Legislature Determines Public Policy.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Generally the definition of what is wise or sound as public policy in the regulation of utilities is a matter to be determined, within constitutional limitations, primarily by the legislature and not by the courts. Main Realty Co. v. Blackstone Valley Gas &amp; Elec. Co., 59 R.I. 29, 193 A. 879, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 132 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Municipal Home Rule.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Considering the need for uniformity in the area of public utility regulatory policy and the extra-territorial effect of a municipal ordinance regulating the installation of power lines, the town’s ordinance was impermissibly one of statewide character and the ordinance constituted an action ultra vires of the authority delegated by the town’s home rule charter. East Greenwich v. O'Neil, 617 A.2d 104, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 209 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Powers of Commission.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statutory sentiments of this section and § 39-1-38 represent a clear legislative intent to grant the commission broad powers as it seeks to establish a system of rates which will be just and equitable to all concerned including the utility and its customers. Rhode Island Chamber of Commerce Fed'n v. Burke, 443 A.2d 1236, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 829 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Local commission failed to show that the PUC exceeded its authority, acted illegally, arbitrarily, or unreasonably ordered retention and funding of an independent auditor; the auditor could not invade the prerogative of the local commission. In re Narragansett Bay Comm'n Gen. Rate Filing, 808 A.2d 631, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 187 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-1-1 limited the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission’s (PUC’s) authority to regulating conduct of companies offering intrastate services to the public, and because voice messaging service (VMS) was an intrastate and an interstate service that could not be separated into intrastate and interstate services, the PUC exceeded its authority under § 39-1-1(c) by ordering a telephone company to provide VMS to its competitors at a discounted rate. Verizon New Eng. Inc. v. R.I. PUC, 822 A.2d 187, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 128 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Public Utility Commission’s (PUC) decision to deny a county water authority’s (CWA) requested rate increase of 35 percent by limiting the funding of the CWA’s infrastructure replacement program did not conflict with the Comprehensive Clean Water Infrastructure Act of 1993 (CCWIA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-15.6-6, because the PUC’s statutory authority in R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-1-1(c) could be read harmoniously with the CCWIA as consistent with the legislature’s design that the PUC review rate cases and protect the public from unreasonable rates, tolls, and charges. In re Kent County Water Auth. Change Rate Schedules, 996 A.2d 123, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 86 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Purposes of Chapters 1 to 5.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature had the following purposes in mind by enactment of chapters 1 to 5 of this title: (1) to protect the public and the utility against improper or unreasonable rates, tolls and charges by providing a full, fair and adequate administrative remedy, (2) to secure to the aggrieved party a judicial review of administrative proceeding, and (3) to provide that procedure instituted be the exclusive remedy. New Eng. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Kennelly, 75 R.I. 422, 67 A.2d 705, 1949 R.I. LEXIS 72 (1949).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Ratemaking.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although charged with consideration of consumer interests in fixing rates, the public utilities commission must not base its rulings on consumer ability to pay for services rendered, as consumer interests are adequately protected if the commission permits the utility to earn a return no greater than is necessary to maintain its financial health. Narragansett Elec. Co. v. Harsch, 117 R.I. 395, 368 A.2d 1194, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1707 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions of this title manifest a legislative intention to vest the judicial attributes of ratemaking and utilities regulation in the public utilities commission and the administrative attributes in the division of public utilities and carriers; and in an appeal from a commission order it was harmless error to name the commissioners rather than the division or its administrator as respondents. Narragansett Elec. Co. v. Harsch, 117 R.I. 395, 368 A.2d 1194, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1707 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The commission’s “additional, implied and incidental power” granted in § 39-1-38 is broad enough to authorize the commission to require utilities to present acceptable books of account to support their requests for rate relief and to set specific standards to be met before those books will be deemed acceptable. Bristol &amp; Warren Gas Co. v. Harsch, 119 R.I. 807, 384 A.2d 298, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 625 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A utility seeking an increase in rates must establish not only that it requires an overall increase but that its proposed schedule of rates is nondiscriminatory. United States v. Public Utils. Comm'n, 120 R.I. 959, 393 A.2d 1092, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 744 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The determination of the commission to exempt the first 300 kilowatt hours of electricity used by residential customers could not be sustained unless based upon competent evidence relevant to the issue of rate design. Blackstone Valley Chamber of Commerce v. Public Utils. Comm'n, 121 R.I. 122, 396 A.2d 102, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 1750 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Restriction on Regulation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While this title details a comprehensive plan of public utility regulation with primary responsibility of carrying out the plan being vested in the commission, there is also a clearly expressed legislative intent to restrict the commission’s regulation so that in the absence of an emergency a utility can expect a certain degree of permanency in the type of control exercised over it. Providence Gas Co. v. Burke, 119 R.I. 487, 380 A.2d 1334, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 2055 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Court declined to abstain from considering whether the Pipefitters Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-27-1 et seq., was preempted by federal law because the language of R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 39-1-1(c), 28-27-29 were not ambiguous, and abstention would impose a considerable and unnecessary delay on the parties. There was also no ongoing administrative proceeding warranting Younger abstention, as the state admitted that it had no intention of enforcing the notices of violations it sent to the gas company concerning the failure of its employees to obtain pipefitter licenses. S. Union Co. v. Lynch, 321 F. Supp. 2d 328, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11239 (D.R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Scope of Application.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although this section gives broad powers to the public utilities commission in its supervision over water utility companies, where a water main hookup agreement was no more than a private contract between a city and a group of individuals and the main was not part of the city’s water distribution system, the city’s hookup agreement did not fall within the section’s parameters and thus did not come within the purview of the act.

<p class="p6">Prior to the commencement of any formal hearing, the commission may, in its discretion, direct the parties or their attorneys to appear before it for a conference. At or before the conference, the commission may order any party to file a number of copies, as it may specify, of all exhibits it intends to use in the hearing, and the names and addresses of witnesses it intends to produce in its direct case, together with a short statement of the purposes of each exhibit and of the testimony of each witness. After entry of an order, a party shall not be permitted, except in the discretion of the commission, to introduce into evidence, in its direct case, exhibits that are not filed in accordance with the order. At the conference, the commission may designate a date before which it requires any party in interest to specify what items shown by the filed exhibits are conceded, and further proof of conceded items shall not be required. The commission may also require the parties to simplify the issues; to consider admissions of fact and of documents that will avoid unnecessary proof; and to limit the number of expert witnesses. The commission shall enter an order reciting the concessions and agreements made by the parties, and unless modified at the hearing to prevent manifest injustice, the hearing shall be controlled by the order.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The administrator shall aggregate the expenses of the division, including expenses incurred by the attorney general pursuant to § 39-1-19 and expenses incurred by the commission, for each upcoming fiscal year and shall apportion and assess these expenses among the state’s regulated utilities based upon approved budgets. When submitting the budget, the budget office shall clearly indicate the revenues from assessments. Included within this prospective assessment, shall be those expenses expected to be incurred by the attorney general pursuant to § 39-1-19 for the upcoming fiscal year. The expenses anticipated by the attorney general and the commission for each upcoming fiscal year shall be communicated to the administrator within thirty (30) days of request by the administrator. The administrator shall thereupon apportion and assess one hundred percent (100%) of such expenses among the several public utility companies and common carriers located in this state in the proportion that the gross intrastate-utility-operating revenues of each public utility company and common carrier shall bear to the total, gross intrastate-utility-operating revenues for the last preceding fiscal year of all public utility companies and common carriers; provided, however, that any public utility or common carrier, whose gross intrastate revenues in any fiscal year as reported to the administrator do not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), shall not be subject to the assessment under the provisions hereof; and, provided further, that all motor carriers subject to the provisions of chapters 12 and 14 of this title shall not be subject to the assessment under the provisions hereof. The sum so apportioned and assessed shall be in addition to any taxes payable to the state under any other provision of law. The assessments shall be divided between the commission and the division based upon the approved budgets.</p>

This fund shall be a restricted-receipt account and shall be kept by the general treasurer separately and shall be paid out by the general treasurer only upon receipt of properly authenticated vouchers signed by the administrator, or his or her designee, for the division’s share of the account. The same procedure shall be followed for the commission, except that such vouchers shall be signed by the commission chairperson, or his or her designee. The general treasurer shall provide for separate accounting of the division and commission budget and expenses.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> There is hereby created a fund to be known as the public utilities reserve account, an account within the public utilities commission in the general fund. Such account, hereinafter referred to as the “fund,” shall be used for the purpose of providing the financial means for the commission and division to purchase materials, and to employ on a contract or other basis, legal counsel, official stenographers, engineers, accountants, economists, and other expert witnesses, and for other necessary expenses of the commission and division in investigations and hearings related to applications and filings made by public utilities, or commission- or division-initiated investigations into utility operating practices, or related appeals to state or federal courts or in relevant regulatory matters before federal agencies. The general assembly shall annually appropriate to the fund a sum equal to twenty-five one thousandths of one percent (.00025%) of the gross, annual operating revenues of gas, electric, and telephone companies attributable to their conduct of intrastate operations in this state during the year next preceding; provided, however, that if at June 30, in any year the balance in the fund shall be in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), the amount of the excess shall forthwith be transferred to the general fund of the state. Prebilled revenue shall be excluded from an excess balance to be transferred to the general fund. The state controller is authorized and directed to draw his or her orders upon the general treasurer for the payment from the fund of such sums as may be required from time to time upon receipt by him or her of proper vouchers approved by the administrator.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The public utility making an application or filing to the commission or division, or subject to a commission- or division-initiated investigation, or any public utility distributing electricity or gas whose retail rates would be affected by a proceeding before an agency of the federal government or a federal court, shall be charged with and shall pay a portion of the expenses reasonably so incurred by the commission and by the division for the purchase of materials and for the employment of legal counsel, official stenographers, engineers, accountants, and expert witnesses, and for travel and other necessary expenses as are reasonably attributable to the investigation or the hearing of the proposal by the commission and the division, or to the administrator’s representation of the state before federal or state courts or an agency of the federal government. The administrator or the commission chairperson, as appropriate, shall ascertain the expenses and shall determine the amount to be paid by the public utility company or companies, and bills shall be rendered therefor either at the conclusion of the investigation or hearing, or from time to time during its progress, and the amount of each bill so rendered shall be paid by the public utility to the administrator or the commission, as appropriate, within thirty (30) days from the date of its rendition unless, within the thirty-day (30) time period, the public utility so billed shall request an opportunity to be heard by the commission as to the amount thereof. The commission shall comply with any such request. Any amount of the bill not paid within thirty (30) days from the date of service of the determination upon the hearing, or, if none shall be requested, within thirty (30) days from the date of rendition of the bill, shall draw interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum.

<p class="p4"><b>39-1-27.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Electric distribution companies required to file restructuring plans.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Each electric distribution company shall file with the commission a plan for transferring ownership of generation facilities into a separate affiliate of the electric distribution company. The transmission facilities owned by the electric distribution company also may be transferred to an affiliated electric transmission company at a price that shall equal the book value of the transmission facilities on the electric distribution company’s accounts net of depreciation and deferred taxes as the date of transfer, but such a transfer is not required. The generation plant, equipment, and facilities owned by an electric distribution company shall be transferred to an affiliate that is a nonregulated power producer at a price that shall equal the book value of the generation plant, equipment, and facilities on the electric distribution company’s accounts net of depreciation and deferred taxes as of the date of the transfer. Consistent with the schedule for implementing retail access in § 39-1-27.3, each electric transmission company shall file tariffs with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and electric-distribution companies shall file tariffs with the commission. The tariffs will provide the terms, conditions, and rates for nondiscriminatory access to transmission and distribution facilities to wholesale and retail customers and to nonregulated power producers. The tariffs shall: (1) Conform to the standards, policies, and requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the commission as appropriate with respect to nondiscriminatory access to transmission and distribution services; (2) Fulfill such standards with respect to both transmission and distribution services for the benefit of both wholesale and retail customers and their suppliers; and (3) Provide retail access in accordance with the schedule set forth in § 39-1-27.3. For purposes of this section, “nondiscriminatory access” means access to transmission and distribution services on rates, terms, and conditions found to be reasonable by the FERC or the commission as appropriate and applied consistently to all customers in a rate class regardless of their supplier. When establishing terms and conditions for distribution service, the commission shall implement standards, policies, and requirements consistent with those established by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for transmission service unless it determines that alternative terms and conditions are in the public interest.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The commission shall review the plan within six (6) months of filing and if the plan is in compliance with chapter 3 of this title, shall authorize the property transfers, securities issuances, and affiliate transactions pursuant to this title and shall grant all necessary regulatory approvals. All existing state and local rights, authorizations, and approvals, including but not limited to, permits, licenses, locations, indentures, leases, orders, or similar rights associated with the ownership and operation of plant and equipment, shall be deemed transferred with the associated plant and equipment upon the commission’s authorization of the transfer effective as of the date of transfer. Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, if the electric distribution company’s wholesale power supplier chooses to transfer its generation assets to a nonaffiliate of the electric distribution company for purposes of carrying out the market valuation required by § 39-1-27.4(g), and such transfer to a nonaffiliate is specified in the electric distribution company’s restructuring plan filed with the commission pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the transfer of the electric distribution company’s interest in the generation facilities may be made directly to the nonaffiliate. In the case of such a transfer directly to a nonaffiliate, all of the state and local rights, authorizations, and approvals, including those enumerated above, shall be deemed transferred with the associated plant and equipment upon the commission’s authorization of the transfer effective as of the date of the transfer.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The electric distribution company shall implement the corporate reorganizations and property transfers specified in such restructuring plan; terminate its all-requirements contract with its wholesale power supplier on the terms set forth in § 39-1-27.4; and provide retail access for all customers in Rhode Island with a standard offer, as set forth in § 39-1-27.3, no later than three (3) months after retail access is available to forty percent (40%) or more of the kilowatt-hour sales in New England. The commission may extend this time if it determines that additional time is necessary to implement the transactions on reasonable terms and in accordance with a reasonable schedule; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the effect of § 39-1-27.3 or permit the commission to unduly discriminate in providing retail access among or within rate classes.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Following the complete implementation of the restructuring plans, electric distribution companies shall be prohibited from selling electricity at retail and from owning, operating, or controlling generating facilities, although such facilities may be owned by affiliates of electric distribution companies. For purposes of this subsection, providing the standard-offer service and last-resort power supply in accordance with subsections (d) and (f) of § 39-1-27.3 shall not be construed as selling electricity at retail.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Following the termination of the electric distribution company’s contracts with its wholesale power supplier, the wholesale power supplier shall become a nonregulated power producer, and shall be free, subject to the requirements of the standard offer set forth in § 39-1-27.3(e) and retail electric licensing commission plan requirements pursuant to § 39-1-27.1, to sell electricity generated from each of its facilities on either the wholesale or retail markets at market prices, either directly or through an affiliate, which shall also become a nonregulated power producer. The former wholesale power supplier and its affiliates shall be free to apply to become exempt wholesale generators pursuant to § 32 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, 15 U.S.C. § 79z-5a [repealed], and other federal law, rules, and regulations, and each and every generating facility of the former wholesale power supplier shall become an eligible facility pursuant to that statute. Accordingly, the legislature hereby finds and declares that the division has sufficient regulatory authority, resources, access to books and records to exercise its duties; and that the full participation of former wholesale power suppliers and affiliated nonregulated power producers in the market and the designation of each of the former wholesale power supplier’s facilities as eligible facilities will benefit consumers; is consistent with state law; will not provide any unfair competitive advantage by virtue of their status as a former wholesale power supplier or as affiliates of electric distribution companies; and is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Although reducing air emissions from power plants is a goal of electricity industry restructuring, power plants in Rhode Island already have low emissions relative to their counterparts in other states. For this reason, it is unnecessary for the restructuring plans required by this section to address in-state air emission reductions. However, to the extent a wholesale power supplier receiving contract termination fees pursuant to § 39-1-27.4(b)(4) owns and operates as of December 31, 1995, fossil-fired generation in another state that does not meet air emission standards applicable as of that date to new electric-generating facilities in that state, the wholesale power suppliers shall cooperate with the appropriate environmental officials in the state or states where the generating facilities are located to develop a plan for reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter from the plants on an overall basis through retirements, replacements, controls, or offsets, or any combination of the above, toward the air emissions standards applicable to new electric-generating facilities in effect in the state or states where the plants are located as of January 1, 1996. The plans shall be implemented in connection with electric-industry restructuring in the state or states where the generating facilities are located.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> An electric distribution company, whether public, quasi-municipal, or investor owned, that as of January 1, 1996, did not purchase power at wholesale from a wholesale power supplier under an all-requirements contract, shall include proposals for recovering transition costs consistent with the elements that would be comparable in nature to the elements included in termination fees pursuant to § 39-1-27.4(b) through (g) and for providing a standard offer consistent with requirements of § 39-1-27.3(d) in its plan filed with the commission pursuant to this section. The filing by an electric distribution company that is a quasi-municipal corporation shall also address any unique circumstances affecting the electric distribution company, including special contract requirements or charter restrictions and the conditions that the quasi-municipal corporation must satisfy in order to participate in retail competition. In reviewing the filing and determining the appropriate level of transition cost recovery, the commission shall apply standards consistent with those contained in § 39-1-27.4(b) through (g) and with this subsection. The commission shall be authorized to take any action or to grant any approval necessary to maintain hydroelectric power purchases from the Niagara and St. Lawrence power projects by quasi-municipal corporations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, quasi-municipal electric distribution companies that purchase hydroelectric power from the Niagara and St. Lawrence power projects shall be authorized to continue to resell that power to residential customers within their service territories. After notice and public hearing, the commission may exempt electric distribution companies subject to this subsection from: (1) The requirement to transfer ownership of generation and transmission facilities to affiliated companies pursuant to subsection (a) of this section; and (2) The prohibition against selling electricity at retail pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to sales within the service territory of the electric distribution company, if it determines that the exemptions are in the public interest.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> With the exception of the requirements of the standard offer set forth in § 39-1-27.3(e) and (f) and retail electric licensing commission plan requirements pursuant to § 39-1-27.1, nothing in this section shall be construed or interpreted to constrain the application of antitrust laws to nonregulated power producers, whether affiliated or not with an electric distribution company.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> To promote economic development and the creation and preservation of employment opportunities within the state, each electric distribution company, except Pascoag Utility District, a quasi-municipal corporation, district, and subdivision of the state (“electric distribution company”), shall offer retail access from nonregulated power producers to all customers.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Through year 2009, and effective July 1, 2007, through year 2020, each electric distribution company shall arrange for a standard power-supply offer (“standard offer”) to customers that have not elected to enter into power-supply arrangements with other nonregulated power suppliers. The rates that are charged by the electric distribution company to customers for standard-offer service shall be approved by the commission and shall be designed to recover the electric distribution company’s costs and no more than the electric distribution company’s costs; provided, that the commission may establish and/or implement a rate that averages the costs over periods of time. The electric distribution company shall not be entitled to recover any profit margin on the sale of standard-offer power, except with approval of the commission as may be necessary to implement, fairly and effectively, system reliability and least-cost procurement. The electric distribution company will be entitled to recover its costs incurred from providing the standard offer arising out of: (1) Wholesale standard-offer supply agreements with power suppliers in effect prior to January 1, 2002; (2) Power-supply arrangements that are approved by the commission after January 1, 2002; (3) Power-supply arrangements made pursuant to §§ 39-1-27.3.1 and 39-1-27.8; and (4) Any other power-supply-related arrangements prudently made after January 1, 2002, to provide standard-offer supply or to mitigate standard-offer supply costs, including costs for system reliability, procurement, and least-cost procurement, as provided for in § 39-1-27.7. Subject to commission approval, the electric distribution company may enter into financial contracts designed to hedge fuel-related or other variable costs associated with power-supply arrangements and the costs of any such financial contracts shall be recoverable in standard-offer rates. The electric distribution company’s standard-offer revenues and its standard-offer costs shall be accounted for and reconciled with interest at least annually. Except as otherwise may be directed by the commission in order to accomplish purposes established by law, any over recoveries shall be refunded to customers in a manner directed by the commission, and any under recoveries shall be recovered by the electric distribution company through a uniform adjustment factor approved by the commission. The commission shall have the discretion to apply such adjustment factor in any given instance to all customers or to such specific class of customers that the commission deems equitable under the circumstances provided that the distribution company recovers any under recovery in its entirety. Once a customer has elected to enter into a power-supply arrangement with a nonregulated power producer, the electric distribution company shall not be required to arrange for the standard offer to such customer except as provided in § 39-1-27.3.1. No customer who initially elects the standard offer and then chooses an alternative supplier shall be required to pay any withdrawal fee or penalty to the provider of the standard offer unless such a penalty or withdrawal fee was agreed to as part of a contract; however, no residential customer shall be required to pay a penalty or withdrawal fee for choosing an alternative supplier. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to restrict the right of any nonregulated power producer to offer to sell power to customers at a price comparable to that of the standard offer specified pursuant to this subsection. The electric distribution company may not terminate an existing standard-offer wholesale supply agreement without the written consent of the division.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> In recognition that electricity is an essential service, each electric distribution company shall arrange for a last-resort power supply for customers who have left the standard offer for any reason and are not otherwise receiving electric service from nonregulated power producers. The electric distribution company shall procure last-resort service supply from wholesale power suppliers. Prior to acquiring last-resort supply, the electric distribution company will file with the commission a supply acquisition plan or plans that include the acquisition procedure, the pricing options being sought, and a proposed term of service for which last-resort service will be acquired. The term of service may be short- or long-term and acquisitions may occur from time to time and for more than one supplier for segments of last-resort service load over different terms, if appropriate. All the components of the acquisition plans, however, shall be subject to commission review and approval. Once an acquisition plan is approved by the commission, the electric distribution company shall be authorized to acquire last-resort service supply consistent with the approved acquisition plan and recover its costs incurred from providing last-resort service pursuant to the approved acquisition plan. The commission may periodically review the acquisition plan to determine whether it should be prospectively modified due to changed market conditions. The commission shall have the authority and discretion to approve special tariff conditions and rates proposed by the electric distribution company that the commission finds are in the public interest, including without limitation: (1) Short- or long-term optional service at different rates; (2) Term commitments or notice provisions before individual customers leave last-resort service; (3) Last-resort service rates for residential or any other special class of customers that are different than the rates for other last-resort customers; and/or (4) Last-resort service rates that are designed to encourage any class of customers to return to the market. The electric distribution company’s last-resort service revenues and its last-resort service costs shall be accounted for and reconciled with interest at least annually. Any over recoveries shall be refunded and any under recoveries shall be recovered by the electric distribution company through a uniform adjustment factor approved by the commission. The commission shall have the discretion to apply such adjustment factor in any given instance to all customers or to such specific class of customers that the commission deems equitable under the circumstances provided that the distribution company recovers any under recovery in its entirety. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit an electric distribution company from terminating service provided hereunder in accordance with commission rules and regulations in the event of nonpayment of this service. The commission may promulgate regulations to implement this section including the terms and conditions upon which last-resort service is offered and provided to customers.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> If a customer being served by a nonregulated power producer pays any taxes assessed for electric service to the electric distribution company and the electric distribution company forwards such tax payment for the power portion of the bill to a nonregulated power producer for payment by the nonregulated power producer to the state, neither the customer nor the electric distribution company shall be liable for such taxes forwarded if the nonregulated power producer fails to remit such taxes to the state for any reason.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The commission may, notwithstanding the provisions of § 39-1-27.3, allow customers no longer eligible for standard-offer service to return to standard-offer service, subject to the process set forth in this section. The process shall be as follows: The commission shall hold hearings to determine whether there is a sufficient presence of nonregulated power producers offering reasonably priced power-supply service to customers in Rhode Island. If the commission determines that these market conditions are not present, the commission shall direct the electric distribution company to prepare and file a plan that creates an option for customers to return to the standard offer, including terms and conditions for customers returning and the manner in which the power supply will be procured. This plan may include term commitments or notice provisions before nonresidential customers are permitted to leave standard-offer service once they return. The commission shall conduct a hearing to review the electric distribution company’s plan and issue an order approving the plan, including any modifications the commission deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Once the plan is approved by the commission, the electric distribution company and the division shall jointly prepare a request for power-supply proposals (“RFP”) consistent with the commission’s order, develop reasonable bidder qualifications, issue the RFP, review the bids, and jointly select a winning bidder or bidders to supply power. If the electric distribution company and the division mutually agree that the bids are unreasonably high, they shall have the discretion to reject all bids and re-issue an RFP at a later date that they deem appropriate. If the electric distribution company and the division cannot agree on any matter, the dispute shall be submitted to the commission for resolution. Once the winning bidder or bidders are selected, a supply contract or contracts on terms reasonably acceptable to the distribution company and the division will be executed by the electric distribution company and no further regulatory approval shall be required. However, the results of the bidding process shall be filed with the commission.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> All of the costs associated with the new supply contract(s) will be recovered through standard-offer rates and the electric distribution company’s fully reconciling adjustment provision.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The standard-offer rates for the residential customers returning to the standard offer shall be the same as the standard-offer rate paid by all other standard-offer customers. The standard-offer rates for the nonresidential customers returning to the standard offer shall be determined by the commission after the commission reviews the costs of the power supply resulting from the bid process. The rate for nonresidential customers returning to the standard offer may differ from those of other customers, if the commission deems the rate differential to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Any customer returning to the standard offer may not enter into any agreement to use standard-offer service to arbitrage the market with any supplier while the customer is on the standard offer and it shall be unlawful for any nonregulated power producer to enter into such an agreement.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Nothing in this section shall be construed to create a legally enforceable entitlement for any supplier to require the electric distribution company to select any particular bid and/or sign a contract with the supplier.</p>

<p class="p4"><b>39-1-27.4.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Transition charges authorized.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> An electric distribution company that purchases power at wholesale from a wholesale power supplier under an all-requirements contract shall be authorized to execute an agreement terminating, in whole or in part, such all-requirements contracts on terms that require payment of a contract termination fee complying with the requirements in subsection (b) and notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, shall be allowed to recover the payment through a nonbypassable transition charge paid by all customers of the electric distribution company. Any nonregulated power producer may pay all or a part of its customers’ transition charges.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The contract termination fee paid by the electric distribution company to its wholesale power supplier shall include the electric distribution company’s share of its wholesale supplier’s costs associated with the following:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Regulatory assets related to the generation business that include costs for which recovery has been deferred to the future in accordance with prior rate cases or settlements approved by regulators, or consistent with regulatory precedent; regulatory assets of affiliated fuel suppliers; and transition obligations for post-retirement healthcare costs of the wholesale supplier; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Nuclear obligations including decommissioning costs and nuclear costs independent of operation. Transition costs attributable to nuclear decommissioning must be deposited in unit-specific decommissioning trust funds or returned to customers if not needed. Nuclear costs independent of operation shall mean estimated nuclear operation and maintenance expenses that would be incurred assuming the nuclear units were to permanently cease operating on December 31, 1997; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Above-market payments to power suppliers for purchased power contracts of the wholesale power supplier in place as of December 31, 1995, together with reasonable payments of the wholesale power supplier to buy out of these contracts or to reduce payments pursuant to them; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> The net unrecovered commitments and capital costs of all generating plants owned directly or indirectly by the electric distribution company and its wholesale power supplier as of December 31, 1995, whether or not the generating plants are operating, including natural gas conversion costs and above-market pipeline demand charges. Except as provided above, no operation or maintenance expenses associated with existing fossil-fired or hydroelectric generating facilities may be included in contract termination fees to be recovered by electric distribution companies from customers through transition charges.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Because of the uncertainty associated with the timing and amounts to be paid pursuant to subsections (b)(2) (with the exception of nuclear costs independent of operation) and (b)(3), the termination fee to the wholesale supplier and the related transition charge to the electric distribution company’s customers shall continue until these liabilities have been satisfied with an annual reconciliation of estimated to actual expenses. Because the items specified in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(4) can be determined with certainty or reasonably estimated and the nuclear costs independent of operation can be reasonably estimated, no annual reconciliation is necessary for these items. However, to moderate the rate impact of these items, recovery through the transition charge will be spread over the period from July 1, 1997, through December 31, 2009, with a return on the unamortized balance as specified in subsection (d); effective January 1, 2010, there shall be no allowance for these items in the transition charges billed by electric distribution companies.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> In recognition of the potential for a positive residual value of existing generating facilities at the conclusion of the amortization period in the year 2010, the return on equity allowed on the unamortized balance of subsections (b)(1) and (b)(4) paid to the wholesale supplier and recoverable from customers of the electric distribution company shall be limited to one percentage point plus the average rate of return on BBB-rated long-term utility bonds issued during the six-month (6) period July through December, 1996.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, other than subsection (g), for the period July 1, 1997, to December 31, 2000, the nonbypassable transition charge implemented by the electric distribution company shall recover an amount equal to two and eight-tenths of a cent (2.8¢) per kilowatt-hour transmitted or distributed. After the year 2000, the transition charge recoverable from customers shall be established by the commission in an amount sufficient to recover the costs authorized in this section with an adjustment for any over or under recoveries of the contract termination fees occurring during the period July 1, 1997, to December 31, 2000. The adjustment under this subsection shall be made in a manner the commission determines appropriate.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Any wholesale power supplier receiving contract termination fees with respect to power-purchase contracts pursuant to subsection (b)(3) shall offer to sell, buy down, or assign to others, through either public bid or private negotiation, at least the portion of the contracts attributable to its affiliated electric distribution company. To the extent that bids received or terms negotiated would, on an expected value basis, lower the transition charges paid by ultimate customers in Rhode Island, the wholesaler power supplier shall use all reasonable means to consummate the sale, buydown, or assignment and upon completion shall promptly file appropriate adjustments to the contract termination fees in place at that time. To provide an incentive for wholesale power suppliers to obtain the best possible terms for any sale, buydown, or assignment, they shall be allowed to retain ten percent (10%) of the savings expected to be realized by customers as a result of the sale, buydown, or assignment. The amount of any incentive payment shall be fixed at the time of the sale, buydown, or assignment based on estimated data and recovered in equal payments over the remaining term of the related power-purchase contract with appropriate adjustments for the time value of money.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> Every wholesale power supplier receiving contract termination fees pursuant to this section shall, subject to receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, subject its electric-generating facilities, other than nuclear units or entitlements, as of January 1, 1996, to a form of market valuation through lease, sale, spin-off, or other method. The wholesale power supplier shall select the valuation methodology utilized which may be for all the generating facilities as a group, groups of generating facilities, or individual generating facilities. The wholesale power supplier shall meet its obligations under this section by leasing, selling, spinning off, or otherwise disposing of at least a fifteen percent (15%) interest in its electrical-generating facilities, other than nuclear units or entitlements; provided, however, if, pursuant to a requirement in connection with electric industry restructuring in another state prior to completion of the valuation pursuant to this subsection, a wholesale power supplier subject to this subsection is required to sell, spin-off, or otherwise dispose of more than a fifteen percent (15%) ownership interest in its electric-generating facilities, other than nuclear units or entitlements, then the same requirement, including related timing requirements, shall apply in the state and the market valuation resulting from fulfilling that requirement shall be used in determining the adjustment to the contract termination fee required by this subsection. Once the wholesale power supplier determines the percentage interest in its electrical-generating facilities that it will lease, sell, spin-off, or otherwise submit to market valuation to meet its obligation under this subsection, the company shall develop an implementation methodology to accomplish the lease, sale, spin-off, or other disposition of interest that is reasonably likely to approximate the market value of the generation assets. The implementation methodology shall be filed with the commission on or before July 1, 1997, for the commission to review and approve or reject no later than ninety (90) days after submittal. The commission shall approve the implementation methodology unless the commission finds, after public hearing, the methodology is not reasonably likely to approximate the market value of the company’s generating assets, taking into consideration the restrictions included in mortgage indentures and the need to satisfy the requirements of regulatory authorities outside the state. Promptly after commission approval of the implementation methodology, companies subject to this section must submit, for regulatory review, applications for the approvals necessary to commence such valuation. In addition, companies subject to this section shall also provide the commission with quarterly status reports on the progress of proceedings before other regulatory agencies associated with the implementation of this section. The valuation required by this section shall be completed within six (6) months after: (1) Retail access is available to forty percent (40%) or more of the kilowatt-hour sales in New England or (2) The receipt of all necessary regulatory approval for the valuation, whichever occurs later; provided, however, the commission may extend the deadline for completing the valuation by no more than six (6) months if it determines that an extension is in the public interest. Upon completion of the valuation, the wholesale power supplier, together with its affiliated electric distribution company shall file to adjust the contract termination fees in place at the time the valuation is complete as necessary to reflect the electric distribution company’s share of the market valuation in the transition charge paid by ultimate customers in Rhode Island. Any adjustment shall be net of the estimated revenue lost by the wholesale power supplier as a result of retail access during the period prior to completion of such valuation, the electric distribution company’s share of prudently incurred capital investments made after December 31, 1995, which were reasonably necessary to (i) Enable the electrical-generating facilities to operate safely and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, (ii) Improve environmental performance or to increase fuel diversity or flexibility, with regulatory authorization, reasonable transaction costs, (including the cost of refinancing), and revenue lost as a result of the reduced return on equity specified in subsection (d). For purposes of this section, the unreduced return on equity that will be used prospectively and to value the revenue lost prior to the adjustment shall be the return on equity allowed to the wholesale power supplier’s affiliated electric distribution company as of December 31, 1995, and shall be included in the wholesale power supplier’s overall capital structure following the valuation. Any adjustment to the contract termination fee pursuant to this subsection shall be reflected in the termination fee otherwise calculated in accordance with subsection (b) as a uniform adjustment spread equally over the period beginning with the date the adjustment is made and ending December 31, 2009.</p>

<p class="p6">Each electric distribution company shall submit a proposed supply procurement plan or plans to the commission not later than March 1, 2009, and each March 1 thereafter through March 1, 2018. The supply procurement plan or plans shall be consistent with the purposes of least-cost procurement and shall, as appropriate, take into account plans and orders with regard to system reliability and energy efficiency and conservation procurement. The supply procurement plan or plans will include the acquisition procedure, the pricing options being sought, and a proposed term of service for which standard-offer service will be acquired. The term of service may be of various, staggered term lengths and acquisitions may occur from time to time and for more than one supplier for segments of standard-offer load over different terms, if appropriate. There also may be separate procurement plans for residential and nonresidential classes or separate plans among nonresidential classes. All the components of the procurement plans shall be subject to commission review and approval. Once a procurement plan is approved by the commission, the electric distribution company shall be authorized to acquire standard-offer service supply consistent with the approved procurement plan and recover its costs incurred from providing standard-offer service pursuant to the approved procurement plan. The commission may periodically review the procurement plan to determine whether it should be prospectively modified due to changed market conditions. The commission shall have the authority and discretion to establish eligibility criteria by rate class, and approve special tariff conditions and rates proposed by the electric distribution company that the commission finds are in the public interest, including, without limitation: (1) Short- and long-term optional service at different rates; (2) Term commitments or notice provisions before individual customers leave standard-offer service; (3) Standard-offer service rates for residential or any other special class of customers that are different than the rates for other standard-offer customers; (4) Time of use commodity pricing for specified classes of customers, except residential customers; provided, however, that the commission may establish pilot programs for time of use commodity pricing for residential customers; and/or (5) Standard-offer service rates that are designed to encourage any class of customers to purchase supply directly from the market.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is a constitutional delegation of the legislature’s power to the public utilities commission to review actions of zoning boards and municipal inspections and those involving regulations and ordinances, given the specificity of the functions delegated, the accompanying standards of this section, and the administrative safeguards of chapter 1 of title 39. East Greenwich v. O'Neil, 617 A.2d 104, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 209 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission’s review of a municipal ordinance prohibiting the construction of a certain class of high voltage lines does not involve a coordinate branch of government exercising powers in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. East Greenwich v. O'Neil, 617 A.2d 104, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 209 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In examining this title as a whole, it is evident that the legislature has expressed its intent to cover the field of public-utilities regulation and has declared that the public utilities commission has exclusive power to regulate public utilities. Accordingly, a municipal ordinance regulating the construction of power lines was pre-empted by state law because it invaded a field that the state has intentionally occupied. East Greenwich v. O'Neil, 617 A.2d 104, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 209 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section empowers the commission not only to review municipal actions that are administrative in nature or are zoning board decisions but also to review a municipal ordinance regulating the construction of power lines. The word “ordinance” in this section was meant to include the town council’s ordinance. East Greenwich v. O'Neil, 617 A.2d 104, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 209 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Appellate Review of Zoning Board Decision.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that an appeal in a zoning proceeding involving a public utility must, under this section, be taken to the public utilities commission and not to the superior court does not in any way restrict the inherent power of the supreme court to review, in its discretion, by common law certiorari, the decision of the zoning board. Merciol v. New Eng. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 110 R.I. 149, 290 A.2d 907, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 892 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Applicability of § 45-24-20.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An appeal in a zoning proceeding involving a public utility must be taken under this section and not under former § 45-24-20 (see now § 45-24-69).

<p class="p7"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since a municipal ordinance is presumed to be valid, aggrieved parties have the burden to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that a challenged ordinance was an unreasonable or undue burden. In re Ordinance Adopted by the City of Providence, 745 A.2d 769, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 32 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Electrical Cogeneration Facility Not Under Commission’s Supervision.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Legislative Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature intended the public utilities commission to use a public interest standard in reviewing municipal ordinances and regulations. In re Ordinance Adopted by the City of Providence, 745 A.2d 769, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 32 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Public Utilities Regulation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A town council’s approval of amendments regarding electromagnetic fields to its comprehensive plan invaded the field of public utilities regulation which the legislature has expressly preempted from town and city intrusion under this section. The amendments affected the manner of operation or the placement of equipment of a public utility and amounted to more than an innocuous general policy statement. Town of E. Greenwich v. Narragansett Elec. Co., 651 A.2d 725, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 298 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Scope of Authority.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a facial examination of this provision clearly granted jurisdiction to the public utilities commission to review an ordinance affecting the placing and maintenance of equipment of utility companies and the ability of those utilities to connect their services to buildings occupied by customers, that granting of jurisdiction did not authorize or empower the commission to nullify or substantially modify a municipal ordinance that regulated the maintenance and repair of city streets and highways unless that ordinance was unduly burdensome and adversely affected the ability of a utility company to service its customers.

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The power of eminent domain is not confined to the taking of property for which there is an absolute and immediate need. It extends also to the taking of property which is reasonably necessary, and for which a need will probably exist within a reasonable time. In re Narragansett Elec. Co., 544 A.2d 121, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 104 (R.I. 1988).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Condemnation Upheld.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A condemnation of property is lawful and reasonable where the commissioners are satisfied that the “development of additional transmission capability will contribute to the reliability of electricity supply” and where the findings are substantially supported by legal evidence.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the commission equated the term “for the benefit of the people of the state” with a requirement that a utility’s condemnation proposal must constitute a “public use,” the method used by the commission to determine whether the proposed transmission line will benefit the people of the state is not unreasonable. In re Narragansett Elec. Co., 544 A.2d 121, 1988 R.I. LEXIS 104 (R.I. 1988).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Reasonable Conditions on Orders.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Review.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An electric utility’s proposed transmission-line condemnation route should not be set aside by a reviewing authority absent a finding of an abuse of discretion or arbitrariness, capriciousness, or bad faith on the part of such utility.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> <b>Preamble.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the past ten (10) years, the schools and libraries of Rhode Island have benefited from a regulatory agreement with Verizon and its predecessor companies that has provided up to two million dollars ($2,000,000) annually for support of telecommunications lines for internet access. In addition, the funds provided for in the original regulatory agreement and every dollar generated hereunder leverages a one dollar and twenty-seven cents ($1.27) federal E-Rate match. With the regulatory agreement approaching its termination and the advent of more advanced technologies, it is the intent of this section to provide a continued source of funding for internet access for eligible public and private schools and libraries.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> <b>Definitions.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> “Department” means the Rhode Island department of elementary and secondary education.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> “Division” means the division of public utilities and carriers.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> “Telecommunications education access fund” means the programs and funding made available to qualified libraries and schools to assist in paying the costs of acquiring, installing, and using telecommunications technologies to access the internet.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> <b>Purpose.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The purpose of the telecommunications education access fund shall be to fund a basic level of internet connectivity for all of the qualified schools (kindergarten through grade 12) and libraries in the state.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> <b>Authority.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The division shall establish, by rule or regulation, an appropriate funding mechanism to recover from the general body of ratepayers the costs of providing telecommunications technology to access the internet.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The general assembly shall determine the amount of a monthly surcharge to be levied upon each residence and business telephone access line or trunk in the state, including PBX trunks and centrex equivalent trunks and each service line or trunk, and upon each user interface number or extension number or similarly identifiable line, trunk, or path to or from a digital network. The department will provide the general assembly with information and recommendations regarding the necessary level of funding to effectuate the purposes of this section. The surcharge shall be billed by each telecommunications services provider and shall be payable to the telecommunications services provider by the subscriber of the telecommunications services. State, local, and quasi-governmental agencies shall be exempt from the surcharge. The surcharge shall be deposited in a restricted-receipt account, hereby created within the department of elementary and secondary education and known as the telecommunications education access fund, to pay any and all costs associated with subsection (b)(3). The amount of the surcharge shall not exceed thirty-five cents ($.35) per access line or trunk.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The surcharge is hereby determined to be twenty-six cents ($.26) per access line or trunk.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The amount of the surcharge shall not be subject to the sales and use tax imposed under chapter 18 of title 44 nor be included within the gross earnings of the telecommunications corporation providing telecommunications service for the purpose of computing the tax under chapter 13 of title 44.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> <b>Administration.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The division, with input from the department, shall administer the telecommunications education access fund consistent with the requirements of the Universal Service (E-Rate) program. The division of taxation shall collect from the telecommunications service providers the amounts of the surcharge collected from their subscribers. The department, with the approval of the division, shall publish requests for proposals that do not favor any particular technology, evaluate competitive bids, and select products and services that best serve the internet access needs of schools and libraries. In doing so, the department shall endeavor to obtain all available E-Rate matching funds. The department is further authorized and encouraged to seek matching funds from all local, state, and federal public or private entities. The department shall approve disbursement of funds under this section in accordance with the division’s directives. Unsuccessful bids may be appealed to the division. The division shall annually review the department’s disbursements from this account to ensure that the department’s decisions do not favor any competitor.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> <b>Eligibility.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All schools seeking support from the fund must be eligible for Universal Service (E-Rate) support and meet the definition of “elementary school” or “secondary school” in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. § 8801). Schools operating as a for-profit business or with endowments exceeding fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) are not eligible for support. All libraries seeking support from the fund must meet the definition of “library” or “library consortium” in the Library Services and Technology Act, Pub. L. No. 104-208, § 211 et seq., 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) and must be eligible for assistance from a state library administrative agency under that act. Only libraries that have budgets that are completely separate from any schools (including, but not limited to, elementary and secondary, colleges and universities) shall be eligible to receive support. Libraries operating as a for-profit business shall not be eligible for support.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Electricity produced by cogeneration and small power production can be of benefit to the public as part of the total energy supply of the entire electric grid of the state or consumed by a cogenerator or small power producer. Subject to compliance with applicable rules governing service, public utilities shall provide transmission or distribution service to enable a retail customer to transmit electrical power generated by the customer at one location to the customer’s facilities at another location, if the commission finds that the provision of this service, and the charges, terms, and other conditions associated with the provision of this service, are not likely to result in higher cost electric service to the utility’s general body of retail and wholesale customers or adversely affect the adequacy or reliability of electric service to all customers.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Each electric distribution company shall provide backup and supplemental service to any customer who is self-generating electricity and meets reasonable interconnection requirements designed to protect the distribution and transmission system. The commission shall ensure that backup and supplemental rates made, exacted, demanded, or collected by any public utility from a customer who is self-generating shall be just and reasonable and may not be unduly discriminatory. Any backup and supplemental rate tariffs in effect as of May 2002 may remain in effect as designed through December 31, 2004. Commencing January 1, 2005, the backup and supplemental rates shall be cost-based but may be discounted as provided for in subsection (c); provided, however, that the John O. Pastore Center power plant shall be exempt from the backup or supplemental rates.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Notwithstanding the rate design criteria set forth in subsection (b), the commission may permit or require discounted backup-distribution-service rates in order to encourage economically efficient cogeneration or small power-production projects if it finds these discounts to be in the public interest and/or contribute to system reliability procurement or least-cost procurement; provided, however, that any revenue not recovered by the electric distribution company as a result of these discounted distribution rates shall be accounted for and recovered in the rates assessed on all customers. The commission shall, in determining the public interest in distributed-generating facilities, consider reduced environmental impacts, increased energy efficiency, reduced transmission losses and congestion, effects on electric system reliability, and other factors the commission may deem relevant.</p>

Contact voltage is caused by power system fault current as it flows through the impedance of available fault current pathways. Faults contributing to contact voltage may be due to electric system deterioration or damage or improper installation. Contact voltage is of greatest concern in areas where underground electric-distribution systems exist, as faults on those systems may remain active for long periods of time before detection and repair, and therefore contact voltage is a potential shock hazard.</p>

The program shall require electric distribution companies to implement appropriate procedures to detect contact voltage on publicly accessible surfaces that could become energized by contact voltage due to faults in the underground distribution system. The program shall also recognize the potential for publicly accessible objects such as sidewalks, roadways, fences, storm drains, or other metallic gratings to become energized by faults to the underground distribution system.

<p class="p4"><b>39-3-1.2.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Aggregation of electrical load by municipality or group of municipalities.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a) (1)</b> The legislative authority of a municipality may adopt an ordinance or resolution, under which it may aggregate in accordance with this section one or more classes of the retail electrical loads located, respectively, within the municipality or town and, for that purpose, may enter into service agreements to facilitate for those loads the sale and purchase of electricity. The legislative authority also may exercise this authority jointly with any other legislative authority. An ordinance or resolution under this section shall specify whether the aggregation will occur only with the prior consent of each person owning, occupying, controlling, or using an electric load center proposed to be aggregated or will occur automatically for all persons pursuant to the opt-out requirements of this section. Nothing in this section, however, authorizes the aggregation of retail electric loads of an electric load center that is located in the certified territory of a nonprofit electric supplier or an electric load center served by transmission or distribution facilities of a municipal electric utility.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> No legislative authority pursuant to an ordinance or resolution under this section that provides for automatic aggregation as described in this section, shall aggregate the electrical load of any electric load center located within its jurisdiction unless it in advance clearly discloses to the person owning, occupying, controlling, or using the load center that the person will be enrolled automatically in the aggregation program and will remain so enrolled unless the person affirmatively elects by a stated procedure not to be so enrolled. The disclosure shall state prominently the rates, charges, and other terms and conditions of enrollment. The stated procedure shall allow any person enrolled in the aggregation program the opportunity, at a minimum, to opt-out of the program every two (2) years, without paying a switching fee. Any person who leaves the aggregation program pursuant to the stated procedure shall default to the last-resort service until the person chooses an alternative supplier.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> A governmental aggregator under this section is not a public utility engaging in the wholesale purchase and resale of electricity, and the aggregated service is not a wholesale utility transaction. A governmental aggregator shall be subject to supervision and regulation by the commission only to the extent of any competitive retail electric service it provides and commission authority.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> A town may initiate a process to authorize aggregation by a majority vote of a town meeting or of the town council. A city may initiate a process to authorize aggregation by a majority vote of the city council, with the approval of the mayor, or the city manager. Two (2) or more municipalities may, as a group, initiate a process jointly to authorize aggregation by a majority vote of each particular municipality as required in this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Upon the applicable requisite authority under this section, the legislative authority shall develop a plan of operation and governance for the aggregation program so authorized. Before adopting a plan under this section, the legislative authority shall hold at least one public hearing on the plan. Before the hearing, the legislative authority shall publish notice of the hearing once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the jurisdiction. The notice shall summarize the plan and state the date, time, and location of any hearing. A municipality or group of municipalities establishing load aggregation pursuant to this section shall develop a plan, for review by its citizens, detailing the process and consequences of aggregation. The plan shall identify which classes of customers may participate, based on their applicable electric distribution company tariff or rate schedule. Any municipal load aggregation plan established pursuant to this section shall provide for universal access to all applicable customers and equitable treatment of applicable classes of customers and shall meet any requirements established by law or the commission concerning aggregated service. The plan shall be filed with the commission, for its final review and approval, and shall include, without limitation, an organizational structure of the program, its operations, and its funding; the process for establishing rates and allocating costs among participants; the methods for entering and terminating agreements with other entities; the rights and responsibilities of program participants; and termination of the program. The plan must also include the terms and conditions under which retail customers who or that have chosen to opt-out of the aggregated service may take service from the aggregated entity. At the time of the legislative authority’s filing of the plan with the commission, a copy of the proposed plan filing shall be provided to the electric distribution company whose customers would be included in the plan. Prior to its decision, the commission shall conduct a public hearing. Following approval of the plan, the legislative authority may solicit bids from nonregulated power producers pursuant to the methods established by the plan. The legislative authority shall report the results of this solicitation and proposed agreement awards to the commission. The legislative authority shall have the right to terminate the operation of the plan by placing its customers on last-resort service. If the legislative authority terminates the operation of the plan and places customers on last-resort service, a municipality seeking to form a new municipal aggregation load must submit a new plan to the commission for approval, in accordance with this section, before the customers may enroll in a new aggregation program.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e) (1)</b> Any retail customer in a municipality with an approved aggregation plan may elect instead to receive retail supply from another licensed retail supplier or from the local distribution company. Within thirty (30) days of the date the aggregated entity is fully operational, ratepayers who or that have not affirmatively elected an alternative authorized supplier shall be transferred to the aggregated entity subject to the opt-out provision in this section. Following adoption of aggregation as specified above, the program shall allow any retail customer to opt-out and choose any supplier or provider that the retail customer wishes. Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing any city or town or any municipal retail load aggregator to restrict the ability of retail electric customers to obtain or receive service from any authorized provider of it.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> It shall be the duty of the aggregated entity to fully inform participating ratepayers in advance of automatic enrollment that they are to be automatically enrolled and that they have the right to opt-out of the aggregated entity without penalty. In addition, such disclosure shall prominently state all charges to be made and shall include full disclosure of the standard-offer rate, how to access it, and the fact that it is available to them without penalty, if they are currently on standard-offer service. The commission shall furnish, without charge, to any citizen a list of all other supply options available to them in a meaningful format that shall enable comparison of price and product.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The municipality or group of municipalities shall, within two (2) years of approval of its plan, or such further time as the commission may allow, provide written notice to the commission that its plan is implemented. The commission may revoke certification of the aggregation plan if the municipality or group of municipalities fails to substantially implement the plan.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> The commission may, from time to time, promulgate rules by which the legislative authority may request information from the electric distribution company or companies whose customers would be included in its plan. These rules shall ensure that municipalities have reasonable and timely access to information pertinent to the formation of the plan and solicitation of bids to serve customers; that confidentiality of individuals is protected; and that charges for production of data are reasonable and not unduly burdensome to the legislative authority.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Town’s contention that the notice given by the water company and the public utilities commission of the changes in the initial rate increase filing failed to comply with § 42-35-9 was without merit where the company filed its request for a rate increase pursuant to this section, and consequently all action subsequently taken by the company and the public utilities and carrier commission with respect to the initial filing was subject to the provisions of this section, including both the company’s obligation to notify its customers of the filing, and the commission’s obligation to hold a public hearing on the propriety of the rate increase; and therefore, the notice requirements under the APA were inapplicable when title 39 explicitly directed the parties on the appropriate course of action in a rate proceeding. Narragansett v. Malachowski, 621 A.2d 190, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 63 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Delayed Decision.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The 90-day provision of this section was mandatory, and where the commission allowed more than 90 days to pass between the completion of its rate hearings and the issuance of its decision and order, the utility was entitled to collect retroactive charges for the period of delay. Bristol County Water Co. v. Public Utils. Comm'n, 117 R.I. 89, 363 A.2d 444, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1604 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Effect of Denied Increase.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The public utilities commission discharged its duty to suspend a proposed schedule of rates by rejecting the schedule within eight months of their being proposed. Moreover, this section does not require the commission to put into effect substitute rates offered after the proposed rates have been rejected since there is no requirement that a rate become effective within the eight-month period, but merely that an order issue. Providence Gas Co. v. Burke, 475 A.2d 193, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 460 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Federal Preemption.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state’s authority to regulate interstate wholesale utility rates was preempted by congress’s enactment of the Federal Power Act, hence jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of the wholesale rate charged by the New England Power Company to the Narragansett Electric Company rests exclusively with the federal power commission. Narragansett Elec. Co. v. Burke, 119 R.I. 559, 381 A.2d 1358, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 2060 (1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 972, 98 S. Ct. 1614, 56 L. Ed. 2d 63, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 1507 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Hearing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the commission held a public hearing concerning the refund process under a purchase gas price adjustment clause, but failed to give the parties clear and simple notice of the subject matter to be considered at the hearing as required by § 42-35-9, the commission’s attempted amendment of the adjustment clause was a nullity. Providence Gas Co. v. Burke, 119 R.I. 487, 380 A.2d 1334, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 2055 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The latter segment of this section concerning periodic public hearings does not authorize the commission to stay continued operation of an effective tariff pending the outcome of the hearing; the tariff will continue in operation until a hearing is held and an order has been entered. Providence Gas Co. v. Burke, 119 R.I. 487, 380 A.2d 1334, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 2055 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A “public hearing” concerning the propriety of rates under this section must be commenced and conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 35 of title 42 concerning administrative procedures, since the type of action contemplated by this section constitutes ratemaking and thus falls within the definition of “contested case,” § 42-35-1. Providence Gas Co. v. Burke, 119 R.I. 487, 380 A.2d 1334, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 2055 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not require public hearings where such hearings would be empty formalities convened merely to deny tariff requests which, on their face, are without acceptable supporting evidence. Bristol &amp; Warren Gas Co. v. Harsch, 119 R.I. 807, 384 A.2d 298, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 625 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where public utility applied for a rate case hearing and the public utilities commission ordered the rate case suspended then merged the case with another involving the utility’s violations of previous commission orders involving accounting practices, the commission’s order to merge the case, in effect, was a dismissal of the rate case without a hearing in violation of both the commission’s statutory duty and the utility’s right to due process. Bristol &amp; Warren Gas Co. v. Burke, 439 A.2d 246, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1414 (R.I. 1981).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Initial Rate Filing.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because, under this section the public utilities commission has the authority to review and approve the rates of a public utility, whether an initial rate or a proposed change of existing rates, and is mandated to periodically review and hold public hearings respecting those rates in the absence of any proposed rate change, the commission has subject matter jurisdiction to determine the propriety of an initial rate filing of a public utility.

<p class="p7"><b>Losses of Utility.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In determination of reasonable rate to be charged to the public, a loss sustained by utility in constructing a main for the purpose of acquiring new business which did not materialize could not be charged to the public. Public Utils. Comm'n v. East Providence Water Co., 48 R.I. 376, 136 A. 447, 1927 R.I. LEXIS 142 (1927).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Deficits incurred in furnishing service at a low rate to an industry owned by the owners of the utility and from transferring valuable rights to the industry could not be used to justify an increase in rates. Public Utils. Comm'n v. East Providence Water Co., 48 R.I. 376, 136 A. 447, 1927 R.I. LEXIS 142 (1927).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supreme court upheld commission ruling where subsidiary utility sought rate increase to insure cash working capital adequate to cover time lag between payment of its bills for power purchases from its interstate supplier and receipt of payment from its customers, and commission disallowed the increase because the subsidiary was unnecessarily paying its bills before the end of the “grace period” allowed by its supplier, thereby losing interest. Narragansett Elec. Co. v. Harsch, 117 R.I. 395, 368 A.2d 1194, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1707 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The public utility commission may treat a power company’s proposed rate increase based upon the increased cost of purchasing electrical power as it treats other filings for charged rates under this section and investigate the overall financial structure of the power company to determine whether the company has experienced savings in other areas which might offset the increased price for power. Narragansett Elec. Co. v. Burke, 119 R.I. 559, 381 A.2d 1358, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 2060 (1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 972, 98 S. Ct. 1614, 56 L. Ed. 2d 63, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 1507 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the water company requested the setting of rates based partially upon past losses, this fell clearly within the general proscription against retroactive ratemaking, even though the company’s loss might have been attributable to the inevitable result of regulatory lag. Bristol County Water Co. v. Harsch, 120 R.I. 223, 386 A.2d 1103, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 658 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Retroactive Recovery of Losses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The rule against retroactive ratemaking does not apply to prevent a utility company from recovering unusual and nonrecurring expenses related to extraordinarily severe storms.

<p class="p7"><b>Mandamus.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the public utilities commission refused to act on an application for an increase in rates on the ground that it did not have jurisdiction and there was some doubt as to the right of appeal, mandamus was a proper remedy. East Providence Water Co. v. Public Utils. Comm'n, 46 R.I. 458, 128 A. 556, 1925 R.I. LEXIS 30 (1925).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Meter Charges.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The commission may fix a service charge for gas meters and this does not violate § 11-35-10, since the latter provision penalizes the wrongful collection of a greater amount than is due on inspection of a meter and does not relate to a uniform rate. Rivelli v. Providence Gas Co., 44 R.I. 76, 115 A. 461, 1921 R.I. LEXIS 51 (1921).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where town was on notice as of March 15, 1991 that public utilities company was requesting a rate increase, and thereafter, on or about May 13, 1991, the public utilities commission mailed a copy of the schedule to the manager of the town that included a date for intervenors, if any, to file testimony, and a public hearing was subsequently held on August 20, 1991, and consequently the water company and public utilities and carriers division filed an agreement and settlement of the increased rates, the company fully complied with the statutory obligations and the town’s claim that the agreement and settlement triggered additional notice due to the increase in rates was without merit, for the increase did not terminate the original filing of rates or signify the beginning of a new filing. Narragansett v. Malachowski, 621 A.2d 190, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 63 (R.I. 1993).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Prospective Application of Increase.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Increased utility rates cannot be retroactively applied by charging a customer for services already rendered; instead, increased rates should be applied prospectively so that consumers will be billed for energy consumed only after the commission has approved the new rates.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a utility’s post-test year bond issue threatened to raise its interest expenses, and consequently its federal interest payment tax deduction, the commission properly took the increased interest deduction into account in setting the utility’s rates, and was not restricted to a consideration of data accumulated only during the test year.

When a railroad is granted permission to abandon any rail line by the Interstate Commerce Commission and gives up use of the entire width of its right of way in that area, an opportunity is afforded for the establishment of a facility for another means of transportation or for a necessary public recreation or conservation area in the community land which was not theretofore readily available. Railroads, by reason of their statutory privilege of land acquisition by condemnation and statutory protection from acquisition of their land by condemnation, are a proper subject for a special statutory procedure for the disposition of their unused or undeveloped lands.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>City’s request for proposals requiring towing companies to remit a referral fee to the city was invalid because enforcement of the Towing Storage Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 39, ch. 12.1, rested with the state Division of Public Utilities and there was no transfer or delegation of that authority to the cities and towns; further, R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-12-12 contained language that prohibited a towing company from refunding or remitting, in any manner, any portion of its fee. Thus, state law explicitly prohibited towing companies from both refunding money to a customer and from transmitting any portion of the rates or charges to anyone in any manner, including the person or entity that selected the tow company.

Gen. Laws tit. 39, ch. 12.1, rested with the state Division of Public Utilities and there was no transfer or delegation of that authority to the cities and towns; further, R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-12-12 contained language that prohibited a towing company from refunding or remitting, in any manner, any portion of its fee. Thus, state law explicitly prohibited towing companies from both refunding money to a customer and from transmitting any portion of the rates or charges to anyone in any manner, including the person or entity that selected the tow company.

<p class="p6">WHEREAS, A tow truck in the hands of an incompetent operator is a dangerous instrumentality; and</p>
<p class="p6">WHEREAS, The public has an inherent right to ready access to the name, location, and telephone number of certificated towers; and</p>
<p class="p6">WHEREAS, The operation of a tow truck on the public highway with a vehicle in tow is a dangerous instrumentality exposing others on or about the highway to loss or damage, which must be covered by adequate insurance; and</p>
<p class="p6">WHEREAS, The motoring public has a right, when delegating to law enforcement the selection of an operator in the towing-storage business, to expect that the operator selected and responding will be competent; and</p>
<p class="p6">WHEREAS, The motoring public has a right when delegating to law enforcement the selection of an operator in the towing-storage business, to expect that the charges for the services to be rendered will be reasonable and compensatory, and that the operator is physically equipped in his or her business to function properly; and</p>
<p class="p6">WHEREAS, The towing and storage of a vehicle without the owner’s consent, as is the case in most police-instigated tows, requires certain procedures to assure the owner that rights of due process of law are not violated; and</p>
<p class="p6">WHEREAS, The owner or person in control of private property of real estate has a right to be free from trespass by vehicle on the private property; and to have any trespassing vehicle removed at the owner’s expense; and</p>
<p class="p6">WHEREAS, The police powers delegated by the legislature of the state include the power of the police, even without the owner’s consent, to have public ways cleared of conditions that, in the opinion of the officer, create a hazardous condition to the motoring public; to have removed abandoned, abandoned and of no value, and unattended vehicles; to have removed and/or relocated vehicles in violation of parking ordinances; and to have removed any vehicle under control of any person arrested for any criminal offense; and</p>
<p class="p6">WHEREAS, The process of selection of the operator of a towing-storage business for police work is unique in that law enforcement, though having the legal duty to order the work, has no legal duty to pay costs and charges connected therewith, the same being the duty of the vehicle owner.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>City’s request for proposals requiring towing companies to remit a referral fee to the city was invalid because enforcement of the Towing Storage Act, R.I.

Laws § 39-12-12 contained language that prohibited a towing company from refunding or remitting, in any manner, any portion of its fee. Thus, state law explicitly prohibited towing companies from both refunding money to a customer and from transmitting any portion of the rates or charges to anyone in any manner, including the person or entity that selected the tow company.

<p class="p7"><b>Enforcement by Cities.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>City’s request for proposals requiring towing companies to remit a referral fee to the city was invalid because enforcement of the Towing Storage Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 39, ch. 12.1, rested with the state Division of Public Utilities and there was no transfer or delegation of that authority to the cities and towns; further, R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-12-12 contained language that prohibited a towing company from refunding or remitting, in any manner, any portion of its fee. Thus, state law explicitly prohibited towing companies from both refunding money to a customer and from transmitting any portion of the rates or charges to anyone in any manner, including the person or entity that selected the tow company.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>City’s request for proposals requiring towing companies to remit a referral fee to the city was invalid because enforcement of the Towing Storage Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 39, ch. 12.1, rested with the state Division of Public Utilities and there was no transfer or delegation of that authority to the cities and towns; further, R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-12-12 contained language that prohibited a towing company from refunding or remitting, in any manner, any portion of its fee. Thus, state law explicitly prohibited towing companies from both refunding money to a customer and from transmitting any portion of the rates or charges to anyone in any manner, including the person or entity that selected the tow company.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The insurance coverage, including the types of coverage and the limits for each coverage, that the TNC provides while the TNC driver uses a personal vehicle in connection with a TNC’s digital network; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> That the TNC driver’s own automobile insurance policy might not provide any coverage while the driver is logged on to the TNC’s digital network and is available to receive transportation requests or is engaged in a prearranged ride, depending on its terms.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Insurers that write automobile liability insurance in Rhode Island may exclude any and all coverage afforded under the policy issued to an owner or operator of a personal vehicle for any loss or injury that occurs while a TNC driver is logged on to a TNC’s digital network or while a TNC driver provides a prearranged ride. This right to exclude all coverage may apply to any coverage included in an automobile insurance policy including, but not limited to:</p>

<p class="p6">Such exclusions shall apply notwithstanding any requirement under § 31-47-2(13)(i)(A).

<p class="p6">Nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude an insurer from providing primary or excess coverage by contract or endorsement for the TNC driver’s personal vehicle while the TNC driver is logged on to a digital network or while the driver is engaged in a prearranged ride.</p>

Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to invalidate or limit an exclusion contained in a policy including any policy in use or approved for use in Rhode Island prior to the enactment of this chapter that excludes coverage for vehicles used to carry persons or property for a charge or available for hire by the public. An automobile insurer that defends or indemnifies a claim against a driver that is excluded under the terms of its policy, shall have a right of contribution against other insurers that provide automobile insurance to the same driver in satisfaction of the coverage requirements of § 39-14.2-14(b) and (c) at the time of loss.</p>

A revenue-stabilization account shall accumulate a maximum of ten percent (10%) of the annual operating expenses of the supplier and shall be used to supplement other revenues so that the supplier’s reasonable costs are compensated. A supplier may draw upon its revenue-stabilization account without further action of the commission if revenues in any fiscal year fall below the level sufficient to provide reasonable compensation for services rendered, subject to periodic review by the commission to ensure that the purposes of § 39-15.1-1 are fulfilled.</p>

The bonds shall be authorized by resolution of the board, and shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from their date, bear interest at such rate or rates payable at such time or times, be in such denominations, be in such form, either coupon or registered, carry such registration privileges and such privileges of reconversion from registered to coupon form, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places and be subject to redemption at such premium, if required, and on such terms, as the resolution may provide.

The proceeds of bonds or notes issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds or notes may be applied, in the discretion of the authority, to the purchase, retirement at maturity, or redemption of the outstanding bonds or notes, either on their earliest or a subsequent redemption date, and may, pending that application, be placed in escrow. Any escrowed proceeds may be invested and reinvested in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States, or in certificates of deposit, time deposits, or repurchase agreements fully secured or guaranteed by the state or the United States, or an instrumentality of either, maturing at such time or times as shall be appropriate to ensure the prompt payment, as to principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, of the outstanding bonds or notes to be so refunded. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied and carried out, any balance of the proceeds and interest, income, and profits, if any, earned or realized on the investments thereof, may be returned to the authority for use by it in furtherance of its purposes. The portion of the proceeds of bonds or notes issued for the additional purpose of paying all or part of the cost of acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, rehabilitating, developing, or improving any property of the authority may be invested and reinvested in such obligations, securities, and other investments consistent with this section as shall be specified in the resolutions under which the bonds are authorized and that shall mature not later than the times when the proceeds will be needed for these purposes. The interest, income, and profits, if any, earned or realized on the investments may be applied to the payment of all parts of the costs, or may be used by the authority otherwise in furtherance of its purposes. The issuance of the bonds, the maturities, and other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the rights, duties, and obligations of the authority in respect to the bonds shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter insofar as the provisions may be applicable.</p>

Within six (6) months thereafter, in the event of acquisition by eminent domain, the authority shall cause to be filed in the land evidence records of the city or town in which the transit property is located (for the purpose of this section, all personal property shall be deemed to be located in the city or town where the transit company has its principal place of business), a copy of the resolution of the authority, together with a description of the property or interest therein and a statement signed by the chairperson of the authority that the property is taken pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Thereupon, the authority shall file in the superior court, in and for the county in which the transit property is located, a statement of the sum of any estimate by the authority to be just compensation for the property taken. If the property is located in more than one county, the statement shall be filed in the superior court in and for the county where the transit company has its principal place of business.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Upon the filing by the authority of the copy of resolution, description, and statement in the land evidence records of the city or town, the filing in the superior court of the statement and the depositing in the superior court to the use of the persons entitled thereto of the sum as the court shall determine to be amply sufficient to satisfy the claims of all persons having an estate or interest in the property (and the court may in its discretion take evidence on the question to determine the sum to be deposited), title to the property shall vest in the authority absolutely and in fee simple, and the authority thereupon may take possession of the property. No sum so paid into the court shall be charged with clerk’s fees of any nature.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> After the filing of the copy of resolution, description, and statement, notice of the taking of the property shall be served upon the owners of and persons having an estate in or interest in the property by the sheriff or his or her deputies of the county in which the property is located, leaving a true and attested copy of the description and statement with each of the persons personally or at their last and usual place of abode in this state with some person living there, and in case any of the persons are absent from this state and have no last and usual place of abode therein occupied by any person, the copy shall be left with the persons, if any, in charge of or having possession of the property, or interest therein, taken of such absent persons if the same are known to the officer; and after the filing of the copy of resolution, description, and statement, the secretary of the authority shall cause a copy of the resolution and statement to be published in some newspaper, published or having general circulation in the county where the property, or interest therein, may be located, at least once a week for three (3) successive weeks. If any person shall agree with the authority for the price of the property or interest therein so taken, the court upon the application of the parties in interest, may order that the sum agreed upon be paid forthwith from the money deposited, as the just compensation to be awarded in the proceeding.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Any owner of or persons entitled to any estate in or interest in any part of the real property or interest therein, so taken, who cannot agree with the authority for the price of the property or interest therein so taken in which he or she has an estate or interest as provided in this section, may, within three (3) months after personal notice of the taking, or, if he or she have no personal notice, may, within one year from the first publication of the copy of the resolution and statement, apply by petition to the superior court in and for the county in which the property, or interest therein, lies, setting forth the taking of his or her property, or interest therein, and praying for an assessment of damages. Upon filing of the petition, the court shall cause twenty (20) days’ notice of the pendency thereof to be given to the authority by serving the chairperson of the authority with a certified copy thereof, and may proceed after such notice to the trial thereof; and the trial shall determine all questions of fact relating to the value of property, or interest therein, and the amount thereof, and judgment shall be entered upon the verdict, and execution shall be issued therefor against the money so deposited in court and in default thereof against any other property of the authority. In case two (2) or more conflicting petitioners make claim to the same property, or to any interests therein, or to different interests in the same piece of property or parcel of land, the court upon motion shall consolidate their several petitions for trial at the same time, and may frame all necessary issues for the trial thereof; and all proceedings taken pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall take precedence over all other civil matters then pending before the court, or if the superior court in and for the county in which such property, or interest therein, lies, be not in session in the county, then the trial may be heard in the superior court for the counties of Providence and Bristol.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> If any properties, or interests therein, in which any minor or other person not capable in law to act in his or her own behalf is interested, are taken by the authority under the provisions of this chapter, the superior court, upon the filing therein of any petition by or in behalf of the minor or other person, may appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor or other person, and the guardian may appear and be heard on behalf of the minor or other persons; and the guardian may also, with the advice and consent of the superior court, and upon such terms as the superior court may prescribe, release to the authority all claims for damages for the lands of the minor or other person or for any interests therein. Any lawfully appointed, qualified, and acting guardian or other fiduciary of the estate of any minor or other person, with the approval of the court of probate within this state having jurisdiction to authorize the sale of lands and properties within this state of any minor or other person, may, before the filing of any petition, agree with the authority upon the amount of damages suffered by the minor or other person by any taking of his or her property, or of his or her interests in any property, and may, upon receiving the amount, release to the authority all claims for damages of the minor or other person for the taking.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> Whenever, from time to time, the authority has satisfied the court that the amount deposited with the court is greater than is amply sufficient to satisfy the claims of all persons having estates or interests in the property, the court may order that the amount of any excess, including any interests or increment of any sums so deposited, shall be repaid to the authority. Whenever the authority has satisfied the court that the claims of all persons interested in land taken have been satisfied, the unexpended balance, including any interest or increment on any sums so deposited, shall be paid forthwith to the authority.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> At any time during the pendency of any proceedings for the assessment of damages for property or interests therein taken, or to be taken, by eminent domain by the authority, the authority or any owner may apply to the court for an order directing an owner or the authority, as the case may be, to show cause why further proceedings should not be expedited, and the court may, upon application, make an order requiring that the hearings proceed and that any other steps be taken with all possible expedition.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The authority is hereby authorized to provide, by resolution, for the issuance at one time, or from time to time, of bonds of the authority for any of its purposes. The bonds may be general obligations of the authority or special obligations payable only from particular funds. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates as may be determined by the authority, and shall mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty (30) years from their date or dates as may be determined by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. Temporary notes of the authority issued in anticipation of revenues to be received by the authority or in anticipation of the receipt of federal, state, or local grants or other aid shall mature no later than thirteen (13) months from their respective dates or six (6) months after the expected date of receipt of the grants or aid, whichever shall be later, and shall be in an amount not exceeding the limitations imposed by the last paragraph of this section. The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of the principal and interest which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. The bonds shall be signed by the chairperson of the authority or shall bear his or her facsimile signature, and the official seal of the authority, or a facsimile thereof, shall be impressed or imprinted thereupon and attested by the secretary of the authority, and any coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairperson of the authority. In case any officer whose signature or facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be the officer before the delivery of the bonds, the signature or the facsimile shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he or she had remained in office until delivery. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone, and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The authority may sell such bonds in such manner either at public or private sale and for the price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be disbursed in the manner and under restrictions, if any, as the authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement described in § 39-18-8 securing the bonds.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when the bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds that shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. Except as provided in the following paragraph, bonds may be issued under the provisions of this chapter without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of the state, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions, or things that are specifically required by this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> No bonds shall be issued by the authority unless, at the time of the adoption by the authority of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, the authority shall have received from the general manager or chief financial officer of the authority a certificate indicating that the payments of principal (including any payments made to a reserve fund other than payments made from bond proceeds) and interest on the bonds, together with the payments of the principal and interest on all other then outstanding bonds of the authority, will not exceed during any fiscal year of the authority eighty percent (80%) of the revenues (including, without limitation, grants and other aid) of the authority during the fiscal year. In determining the amount of the principal and interest payments to be made during any fiscal year, there shall be deducted any payments to be made from a reserve fund previously established to provide for the payments. The certificate shall be based upon the reasonable expectations (both as to the amount of revenues to be received by the authority and as to the maximum amount of any variable payments to be made on the bonds) of the officer of the authority executing the certificate at the time the certificate is delivered. The certificate shall describe with reasonable particularity the calculations of principal and interest payments and of anticipated revenues upon which the certificate is based. A copy of the certificate shall be furnished to the governor prior to the issuance of the bonds described in the certificate and, in the case of any bonds whose issuance, according to the certificate, is expected to result in the aggregate amount of principal and interest payments (calculated as above) on the bonds and all then outstanding bonds of the authority exceeding in any fiscal year of the authority fifty percent (50%) of the revenues of the authority, the bonds shall not be issued unless the governor shall have approved the issuance or not disapproved the issuance within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the certificate. Approval or disapproval of any bond issue by the governor shall be evidenced by delivery to the authority of a certificate approving or disapproving the issue or any part thereof.</p>

The trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage any transit property or any part thereof. The trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including, without limitation, covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, and conditions or limitations with respect to the issuance of additional bonds. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state that may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Any trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any trust agreement or resolution may contain other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of the trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the authority’s cost of operation and maintenance.

No officer or employee so transferred and becoming an officer or employee of the authority in accordance with this section shall, by reason of the transfer, without his or her consent be removed, lowered in rank or compensation, or suspended except for just cause and for reasons specifically given to him or her in writing within twenty-four (24) hours after the removal, suspension, or transfer or lowering in rank or compensation; nor shall any officer or employee by reason of transfer, without his or her consent, be in any worse position in respect to workers’ compensation, pension, superannuation, sickness, or other benefits or other allowances granted by his or her previous employer to him or her, the widowed person, family, or personal representatives than he or she enjoyed under any person, firm, or corporation under whom he or she held his or her employment immediately prior to his or her transfer to the employment of the authority; provided, however, that the authority may abolish any office or post of any existing executive officer if in the opinion of the authority the office or post is an unreasonable addition to the staff of the authority.

The member selected by the labor organization and the authority shall act as chairperson of the board. The determination of the majority of the board of arbitration thus established shall be final and binding on all matters in dispute. If, after a period of ten (10) days from the date of the appointment of the two (2) arbitrators representing the authority and the labor organization, the third arbitrator has not been selected, then either arbitrator may request the American arbitration association to furnish a list of five (5) persons from which the third arbitrator shall be selected. The arbitrators appointed by the authority and the labor organization promptly after the receipt of the list, shall determine by lot the order of elimination, and, thereafter, each shall in that order alternately eliminate one name until only one name remains. The remaining person on the list shall be the third arbitrator. The term “labor dispute” shall be broadly construed and shall include any controversy concerning wages, salaries, hours, working conditions, or benefits, including health and welfare, sick leave, insurance, or pension or retirement provisions, but not limited thereto, and including any controversy concerning any differences or questions that may arise between the parties, including, but not limited to, the making or maintaining of collective bargaining agreements, the terms to be included in the agreements and the interpretation or application of the collective bargaining agreements and any grievances that may arise. Each party shall pay one-half (1/2) of the expenses of the arbitration.</p>

<p class="p4"><b>39-21.1-1.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The purpose of this chapter is to establish the number 911 as the primary emergency telephone number for use in the state and to develop and improve emergency communications procedures and facilities with the objective of reducing the response time to emergency calls for law enforcement, fire, medical, rescue, and other emergency services.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> It is hereby declared by the general assembly that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> <b>Availability and type of 911 service in the state.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The citizens of this state enjoy enhanced 911 service where a public safety answering point (PSAP) telecommunicator receives the 911 call, the pertinent information about the nature and location of the emergency by questioning the caller, and confirms the telephone number and address of the calling party. E-911 saves lives and property by helping emergency services personnel do their jobs more quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> <b>E-911 capabilities.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>E-911 information includes Automatic Location Identification (ALI), which permits the prompt dispatch of emergency assistance to the street address of the wireline phone. This capability is especially important where the caller is disoriented, disabled, unable to speak, or does not know his or her location. ALI also reduces the errors in reporting the location of the emergency and in forwarding accurate information to emergency personnel. Automatic Number Identification (ANI) allows the number of the calling party to be displayed at the PSAP. With ANI, the PSAP can call back the party if the call is disconnected. The general assembly finds that ALI and ANI are critical components of effective emergency services.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> <b>Wireless 911 capabilities.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mobility, the primary advantage of wireless technologies, creates complexities for providing E-911 service, necessitating special action for wireless E-911 services.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> <b>The need for wireless E-911 services.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has been reported that the total number of wireless subscribers in the United States exceeds 42 million, and 9.6 million new subscribers were added in 1995 alone. Currently, there are almost thirty thousand (30,000) new wireless subscribers each day, amounting to a forty percent (40%) annual growth rate. Industry studies report that a majority of new subscribers cite safety and security as a primary reason for purchasing a mobile phone. These statistics underscore the growing popularity of mobile communications. With this growth, wireless customers place a large and increasing portion of 911 emergency calls received by PSAPs. In 1994 alone, almost eighteen million (18,000,000) wireless calls were made nationwide to 911 and other public service numbers. It is in the health and safety interests of the citizens of this state that wireless 911 services be enhanced to provide critical ALI and ANI information.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> <b>The FCC mandate for wireless E-911.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In July, 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) took several important steps to foster major improvements in the quality and reliability of wireless 911 services (FCC Docket No. 94-102). The FCC directed wireless carriers to deliver wireless E-911 information to PSAPs by April 1, 1998. The FCC also directed that wireless carriers, by October 1, 2001, identify to the PSAP the latitude and longitude of a mobile unit making an E-911 call within a radius of no more than one hundred twenty-five (125) meters in sixty-seven percent (67%) of all cases.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> <b>PSAP’S ability to receive wireless E-911 information.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Currently, E-911 does not have the necessary systems, facilities, and trained personnel to receive ANI and ALI on wireless calls. It is in the health and safety interests of the citizens of this state that PSAPs have the capability to receive and process wireless E-911 calls, and to require standards of quality of service, performance of service, and technological compliance of all providers of telecommunication services.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> <b>Conditions for providing wireless E-911.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The FCC mandate only applies if (a) PSAPs capable of receiving and utilizing the data elements associated with the E-911 services formally request such services from the wireless carriers in their jurisdiction and (b) a mechanism for the recovery of costs relating to the provision of such services is available. The FCC left it to each state to ensure that a mechanism is in place to permit carriers to recover costs associated with providing E-911 services. The general assembly finds that it is in the public interest to ensure that the conditions imposed by the FCC on wireless carriers to provide E-911 services are met as soon as possible so that the citizens of this state will have more reliable and efficient wireless emergency services.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(8)</b> <b>The need for a funding mechanism.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wireline Enhanced 911 services in the state are funded by telephone subscribers. Wireless 911 services are not funded. Funding for wireless E-911 service will be necessary to ensure PSAPs have the necessary systems to be capable of receiving E-911 information from wireless carriers. Further, given the continued rise in the use of wireless communications, PSAPs will experience increasing demand and incur additional costs for ongoing operation and maintenance of the emergency 911 system. Wireless carriers will incur costs to upgrade systems to be capable of meeting the FCC mandate and will incur a continuous cost in providing E-911 information. The general assembly finds that the principal purpose of wireless E-911 funding is for wireless carriers to recover the costs of providing E-911 services and therefore to fulfill the FCC mandate.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(9)</b> <b>Establishment and purpose of an E-911 emergency services fund.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To ensure that adequate and sustained funding for E-911 statewide emergency services exists so that wireless and wireline E-911 systems can be implemented, maintained, and provided at optimum technical levels, and E-911 services performed at optimum skill levels, the legislature finds that it is necessary and proper to establish a “911 emergency services fund.” The 911 emergency services fund shall be the cost recovery mechanism for all E-911 service providers and shall serve as the means through which PSAP upgrades, including upgrades required to receive E-911 information from wireless carriers, may be implemented and maintained.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(10)</b> <b>Indemnification.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given the complexity of providing E-911 services, the general assembly finds that it is appropriate to provide immunity from civil liability for landline and wireless E-911 service providers. Further, the general assembly finds that to encourage innovation in the provision of emergency services, it is in the public interest to also extend immunity by statute to any person that provides equipment or services for the establishment, maintenance, or operation of E-911 services. Immunity would not extend to willful or wanton acts of misconduct by the E-911 service provider or its employees and agents.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The general assembly finds it is in the public interest for the state to facilitate the construction of a small-scale offshore wind demonstration project off the coast of Block Island, including an undersea transmission cable that interconnects Block Island to the mainland in order to: position the state to take advantage of the economic development benefits of the emerging offshore wind industry; promote the development of renewable energy sources that increase the nation’s energy independence from foreign sources of fossil fuels; reduce the adverse environmental and health impacts of traditional fossil fuel energy sources; and provide the town of New Shoreham with an electrical connection to the mainland. To effectuate these goals, and notwithstanding any other provisions of the general or public laws to the contrary, the town of New Shoreham project, its associated power purchase agreement, transmission arrangements, and related costs are authorized pursuant to the process and standards contained in this section. The Narragansett Electric Company is hereby authorized to enter into an amended power purchase agreement with the developer of offshore wind for the purchase of energy, capacity, and any other environmental and market attributes, on terms that are consistent with the power purchase agreement that was filed with the commission on December 9, 2009, in docket 4111, and amendments changing dates and deadlines, provided that the pricing terms of such agreement are amended as more fully described in subsection (e) of this section, in addition to other amendments that are made to take into account the provisions of this section as amended since the filing of the agreement in docket 4111. Any amendments shall ensure that the pricing can only be lower, and never exceed, the original pricing included in the power purchase agreement that was reviewed in docket 4111. The demonstration project subject to the amended power purchase agreement shall include up to (but not exceeding) eight (8) wind turbines with aggregate nameplate capacity of no more than thirty megawatts (30 MW), even if the actual capacity factor of the project results in the project technically exceeding ten megawatts (10 MW).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The amended power purchase agreement shall be filed with the public utilities commission. Upon the filing of the amended power purchase agreement, the commission shall open a new docket. The commission shall allow the parties to docket 4111 to become parties in the new docket who may file testimony within fifteen (15) days of the filing of the amended agreement. The commission shall allow other interventions on an expedited basis, provided they comply with the commission standards for intervention. The developer shall provide funding for the economic development corporation to hire an expert experienced in power markets, renewable energy project financing, and power contracts who shall provide testimony regarding the terms and conditions of the power purchase agreement to assist the commission in its review, provided that the developer shall be precluded from influencing the choice of expert, which shall be in the sole discretion of the economic development corporation. This testimony shall be filed within twenty (20) days after the filing of the amended power purchase agreement. The parties shall have the right to respond to the testimony of this expert through oral examination at the evidentiary hearings. The commission shall hold one public comment hearing within five (5) days after the filing of the expert testimony. Evidentiary hearings shall commence no later than thirty (30) days from the filing of the amended power purchase agreement.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The commission shall review the amended power purchase agreement, taking into account the state’s policy intention to facilitate the development of a small offshore wind project in Rhode Island waters, while, at the same time, interconnecting Block Island to the mainland. The commission shall review the amended power purchase agreement and shall approve it if:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The amended agreement contains terms and conditions that are commercially reasonable;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The amended agreement contains provisions that provide for a decrease in pricing if savings can be achieved in the actual cost of the project pursuant to subsection (e) of this section;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The amended agreement is likely to provide economic development benefits, including: facilitating new and existing business expansion and the creation of new renewable energy jobs; the further development of Quonset Business Park; and, increasing the training and preparedness of the Rhode Island workforce to support renewable energy projects; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> The amended power purchase agreement is likely to provide environmental benefits, including the reduction of carbon emissions. An advisory opinion on the findings of economic benefit set forth in subsection (c)(3) shall be provided by the Rhode Island economic development corporation and an advisory opinion on the environmental benefits set forth in subsection (c)(4) shall be filed by the Rhode Island department of environmental management. The advisory opinions shall be filed with the commission within twenty (20) days of the filing of the amended power purchase agreement. The commission shall give substantial deference to the factual and policy conclusions set forth in the advisory opinions in making the required findings. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the general laws to the contrary, for the purposes of this section, “commercially reasonable” shall mean terms and pricing that are reasonably consistent with what an experienced power market analyst would expect to see for a project of a similar size, technology and location, and meeting the policy goals in subsection (a).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The commission shall issue a written decision to accept or reject the amended power purchase agreement, without conditions, no later than forty-five (45) days from the filing of the amended power purchase agreement, without delay or extension of the timeframes contained in this section. Any review of the commission’s decision shall be according to chapter 5 of this title, and the supreme court shall advance any proceeding under this section so that the matter is afforded precedence on the calendar and shall be heard and determined with as little delay as possible. The provisions of § 39-26.1-4 and the provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), and (f) of § 39-26.1-5 shall apply, and all costs incurred in the negotiation, administration, enforcement, transmission engineering associated with the design of the cable, and implementation of the project and agreement shall be recovered annually by the electric distribution company in electric distribution rates. The pricing under the agreement shall not have any precedential effect for purposes of determining whether other long-term contracts entered into pursuant to this chapter are commercially reasonable.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> <b>Cap and lower price.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(i) The amended power purchase agreement subject to subsection (a) of this section shall provide for terms that shall decrease the pricing if savings can be achieved in the actual cost of the project, with all realized savings allocated to the benefit of ratepayers. (ii) The amended power purchase agreement shall also provide that the initial fixed price contained in the signed power purchase agreement submitted in docket 4111 shall be the maximum initial price, and any realized savings shall reduce such price. After making any such reduction to the initial price based on realized savings, the price for each year of the amended power purchase agreement shall be fixed by the terms of said agreement. (iii) The amended power purchase agreement shall require that the costs of the project shall be certified by the developer. An independent third party acceptable to the division of public utilities and carriers shall, within thirty (30) days of this certification by the developer, verify the accuracy of such costs at the completion of the construction of the project. The reasonable costs of this verification shall be paid for by the developer. Upon receipt of third-party verification, the division shall notify the Narragansett Electric Company of the final costs. The public utilities commission shall reduce the expense to ratepayers consistent with a verified reduction in the project costs.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The project shall include a transmission cable between the town of New Shoreham and the mainland of the state. The electric distribution company, at its option, may elect to own, operate, or otherwise participate in such transmission cable project. The electric distribution company, however, has the option to decline to own, operate, or otherwise participate in the transmission cable project. The electric distribution company may elect to purchase the transmission cable and related facilities from the developer or an affiliate of the developer, pursuant to the terms of a transmission facility’s purchase agreement negotiated between the electric distribution company and the developer or its affiliate, an unexecuted copy of which shall be provided to the division of public utilities and carriers for the division’s consent to execution. The division shall have twenty (20) days to review the agreement. If the division independently determines that the terms and pricing of the agreement are reasonable, taking into account the intention of the legislature to advance the project as a policy-making matter, the division shall provide its written consent to the execution of the transmission facilities purchase agreement. Once written consent is provided, the electric distribution company and its transmission affiliate are authorized to make a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to put into effect transmission rates to recover all of the costs associated with the purchase of the transmission cable and related facilities and the annual operation and maintenance. The revenue requirement for the annual cable costs shall be calculated in the same manner that the revenue requirement is calculated for other transmission facilities in Rhode Island for local network service under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The division shall be authorized to represent the state of Rhode Island in those proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, including the authority to enter into any settlement agreements on behalf of the state to implement the intention of this section. The division shall support transmission rates and conditions that allow for the costs related to the transmission cable and related facilities to be charged in transmission rates in a manner that socializes the costs throughout Rhode Island. Should the electric distribution company own, operate, and maintain the cable, the annual costs incurred by the electric distribution company, directly or through transmission charges, shall be recovered annually through a fully reconciling rate adjustment from customers of the electric distribution company and/or from the Block Island Power Company or its successor, subject to any federal approvals that may be required by law. The allocation of the costs related to the transmission cable through transmission rates or otherwise shall be structured so that the estimated impact on the typical residential customer bill for transmission costs for customers in the town of New Shoreham shall be higher than the estimated impact on the typical residential customer bill for customers on the mainland of the electric distribution company. This higher charge for the customers in the town of New Shoreham shall be developed by allocating the actual cable costs based on the annual peak demands of the Block Island Power Company and the electric distribution company, and these resultant costs recovered in the per-KWh charges of each company. In any event, the difference in the individual charge per KWh or per customer/month shall not exceed the ratio of average demand to peak demand for Block Island Power Company, relative to the electric distribution company, currently at 1.8 to 1.0 respectively. To the extent that any state tariffs or rates must be put into effect in order to implement the intention of this section, the public utilities commission shall accept filings of the same and shall approve them.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> Any charges incurred by the Block Island Power Company, or its successor pursuant to this section, or other costs incurred by the Block Island Power Company in implementing this section, including the cost of participation in regulatory proceedings in the state or at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall be recovered annually in rates through a fully reconciling rate adjustment, subject to approval by the commission. If the electric distribution company owns, operates, or otherwise participates in the transmission cable project, pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the provisions of § 39-26.1-4 shall not apply to the cable cost portion of the town of New Shoreham project.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> Any contract entered into pursuant to this section shall count as part of the minimum long-term contract capacity.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> If the electric distribution company elects not to own the transmission cable, the developer may elect to do so directly, through an affiliate, or a third party and the power purchase agreement pricing shall be adjusted to allow the developer, an affiliate, or a third party, to recover the costs (including financing costs) of the transmission facilities, subject to complying with the terms as set forth in the power purchase agreement between the developer and the electric distribution company.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations governing the proceedings outlined in this section by April 30, 2010.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The applicant must serve copies of the application to the electric distribution company with whom the applicant is seeking a long-term contract, the division of public utilities and carriers, the office of energy resources, the department of administration, the economic development corporation, and the attorney general. Prior to the filing of any information, the applicant may seek a protective order to protect the confidentiality of information for good cause shown, to the extent that such information is proprietary or confidential business information, but unredacted copies of the entire filing must be provided to the parties identified in this subsection, who shall be bound by any protective order that may be issued regarding further disclosure.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The electric distribution company, the division of public utilities and carriers, and the office of energy resources shall be mandatory parties to the proceeding. The applicant must pay for the reasonable costs of consultants or counsel that may be hired by the commission and the division for the proceeding, but in no case shall the applicant be liable for the costs in excess of $100,000 for the division and $100,000 for the commission, respectively.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> The commission shall issue a final order in the proceedings required by subsection (b) within eight (8) months of the filing of the application. If the commission determines that the proposal meets the standard outlined in subsection (b), the commission shall require the electric distribution company to negotiate a long-term contract with the applicant. The applicant, however, may decline to continue with the project for any reason at any time during the process outlined in this section. The commission may require changes to the applicant’s proposal as a condition to a long-term contract, as the commission determines are just and reasonable. The contract shall contain terms that are commercially reasonable. The contract also shall require that the electric distribution company purchase all of the output of the entire project, unless otherwise authorized by the commission. The parties shall present a proposed contract for review by the commission within three (3) months of the order requiring negotiations. If the parties are unable to reach agreement on a contract within three (3) months of the order requiring negotiations, the commission shall have the discretion to order the parties to arbitrate the dispute on an expedited basis. Once the contract terms are finalized by negotiation or arbitration, the contract shall be filed with the commission for review and approval. The commission shall approve the contract upon a finding that the contract is consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the standards set forth in subsection (b). The commission shall issue its final decision on the proposed contract within sixty (60) days of receiving the proposed contract. Upon execution of the contract, the provisions of §§ 39-26.1-4 and 39-26.1-5 shall apply, and all costs incurred in the negotiation, administration, enforcement, and implementation of the agreement shall be recovered annually by the electric distribution company in electric distribution rates. To the extent the application cites significant economic benefits to Rhode Island that require commitments from the applicant outside of the long-term contract to achieve such benefits, and those economic benefits are ultimately relied upon by the commission in authorizing a long-term contract to be negotiated, the commission may require that appropriate legally binding commitments be made by the applicant as a condition to a long-term contract, unless the commission finds that such commitments are not necessary.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the application process does not convey a legal entitlement to the applicant to a long-term contract. Rather, the purpose of the proceeding is to leave the final decision as to whether a long-term contract should be required to the discretion of the commission, subject to the standards outlined in this section and the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> An applicant under this section shall not be permitted to submit a proposal under the solicitations required in § 39-26.1-3, except that such applicant shall be permitted to submit a proposal under § 39-26.1-7.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(j)</b> Should a proceeding pursuant to this section result in the commission not ordering the distribution company to enter into a long-term contract for a utility-scale offshore wind project, or should the certified developer fail to file an application with the commission within one hundred eighty (180) days of certification, the certification shall be deemed void. In such case, if the commission determines it is in the interest of electric distribution customers to have another utility-scale project considered for a long-term contract, the commission has the discretion to request the department of administration to certify a different developer to make another proposal for a utility-scale offshore wind project per this section, provided that the commission makes such request within ninety (90) days of the certification becoming void. If the commission makes the request, the department of administration may, but is not required to, certify another project and shall have ninety days to submit another certification.

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> By October 15, 2011, and each calendar year following until October 15, 2013, the board may recommend to the commission that the annual target for the following program year be adjusted upward to reflect any shortfalls in meeting the previous program year’s annual target or to reflect any standard contracts entered into during prior program years that are voided. The board may also recommend to the commission that the annual target for the following program year be adjusted downward by any amounts that the previous program year’s annual targets were exceeded by the standard contracts entered into during that program year.</p>

In considering such issues, the board may take into account the reasonableness of current pricing and its impact on all electric distribution customers who will be paying for the output for up to twenty (20) years at such prices. The board may recommend and the commission shall authorize an extension of time to achieve the forty megawatt (40 MW) targets, to allow for contracting to occur after 2014, if necessary.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Within a period of time sufficient to accomplish the purposes of this section, but not longer than ninety (90) days after the effective date of this chapter, the board shall set ceiling prices and annual targets for each renewable energy class of distributed generation for the 2011 program year and make a filing with the commission pursuant to this chapter recommending such prices and targets. Thereafter annually, by no later than October 15 of each year, the board shall make filings with the commission to recommend the standard contract ceiling prices and annual targets for each renewable energy class of distributed-generation facility. The ceiling price for each technology should be a price that would allow a private owner to invest in a given project at a reasonable rate of return, based on recent reported and forecast information on the cost of capital, and the cost of generation equipment. The calculation of the reasonable rate of return for a project shall include where applicable any state or federal incentives including, but not limited to, tax incentives. In setting the ceiling prices, the board also may consider: (1) Transactions for newly developed renewable energy resources, by technology and size, in the ISO-NE region and the northeast corridor; (2) Pricing for standard contracts received during the previous program year; (3) Environmental benefits, including, but not limited to, reducing carbon emissions, and system benefits; and (4) Cost-effectiveness. The board shall, in performing this assessment, involve representation from its advisory council, if applicable, and from the office of energy resources, the electric distribution company, and the energy efficiency and resources management council. The board shall hold, with at least ten (10) business days’ notice, a public community review meeting. The board shall issue a report of its findings from the assessment process recommending standard contract ceiling prices for the upcoming program year. Such report shall be filed with the commission, along with a recommendation for the approval of the ceiling prices for the program year.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The commission shall open a docket to consider for approval ceiling prices proposed by the board. In reviewing the recommended ceiling prices, the commission shall give due consideration to the recommendations and report of the board and the standards set forth in subsection (a). The commission shall issue a decision within sixty (60) days after the recommendations and report are filed with the commission establishing the ceiling prices to be used by electric distribution companies in standard contracts applicable to each renewable energy class in order to effectuate the purposes and provisions of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> During any program year, the board may, on its own initiative, elect to revisit the ceiling prices if the board determines that the prices are either too low or too high. In that case, it may make a filing with the commission to seek a modification to the program for that year, which shall be acted upon by the commission within sixty (60) days. While the request is pending, the electric distribution company may suspend executing standard contracts until a decision is reached on the request.</p>

For small distributed-generation projects, the applicant must submit an affidavit confirming that the project is not a segment of a larger project being planned for enlargement over time. For large distributed-generation projects, the short-form application shall also require the applicant to bid a bundled price for the sale of the energy, capacity, renewable energy certificates, and all other environmental attributes and market products that are available or may become available from the distributed-generation facility, on a per-kilowatt-hour basis for the output of the project. Subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c), the electric distribution company shall not be required to enter into standard contracts in excess of the annual target for the applicable program year and shall not be required to enter into standard contracts in excess of any limit set by the board and approved by the commission for a given enrollment. However, the electric distribution company may voluntarily exceed an enrollment period limit as long as it does not exceed an annual target for the applicable program year.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> For small distributed-generation projects, the electric distribution company shall select projects for standard contracts based on the lowest proposal prices received with any distributed-generation project that meets the requirements of all applicable tariffs and regulations, and meets the criteria of a renewable energy class in effect, until the class target is met. Enrollment periods will be governed by a solicitation and enrollment process rules that shall be filed with the commission each October 15 by the electric distribution company, and approved by the commission within sixty (60) days of such filing.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> For large distributed-generation projects, the electric distribution company shall select projects for standard contracts based on the lowest proposed prices received, but not to exceed the applicable standard contract ceiling price, provided, that the selected projects meet the requirements of all applicable tariffs and regulations and meet the criteria of a renewable energy class in effect until the class target is met. Except for 2011, no enrollment period shall seek to enroll more than one-third (1/3) of the annual goal for the distribution company for large distributed-generation projects.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> If there are more projects than what is specified for a class target at the same price, the electric distribution company shall review the applications submitted and select first those projects that appear to be the furthest along in development and likely to be deployed in consultation with the office. Those projects that are likely to be deployed on the earliest timelines shall be selected. To the extent the electric distribution company is unable to make a clear distinction on this basis, the electric company shall report the results to the board and not enter into contracts with those projects that are tied on pricing. In such case, the board may take such action as it deems appropriate for the selection of projects, including seeking more information from the projects. Alternatively, the board may consider adjustments to the ceiling price and a rebid, or simply wait until the next enrollment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Should an electric distribution company determine that it has entered into sufficient standard contracts to achieve a program-year class target, it shall immediately report this to the board, the office of energy resources, and the commission, and cease entering into standard contracts for that renewable energy class for the remainder of the program year. An electric distribution company may exceed the renewable energy class target if the last standard contract entered into may cause the total purchased to exceed the target. The office and the electric distribution company shall enter into a memorandum of understanding regarding the sharing of the information and data related to the distributed-generation program.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The electric distribution company is authorized to enter into standard contracts up to the applicable ceiling price. As long as the terms of the standard contract are materially the same as the standard contract terms approved by the commission and the pricing is no higher than the applicable ceiling price, the contracts shall be deemed prudent and approved by the commission for purposes of recovering the costs in rates.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> A distributed-generation project that also is being employed by a customer for net-metering purposes may submit an application to sell the excess output from its distributed-generation project. In such case, however, at the election of the self-generator, all of the renewable energy certificates and environmental attributes pertaining to the energy consumed on site may be sold to the electric distribution company on a month-to-month basis outside of the terms of the standard contract. In such case, the portion of the renewable energy certificates that pertains to the energy consumed on site during the net-metering billing period shall be priced at the average market price of renewable energy certificates, which may be determined by using the price of renewable energy certificates purchased or sold by the electric distribution company.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The application process set out in this section shall be applicable to electric distribution companies thirty (30) days after the enactment of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> An applicant for a renewable distributed-generation interconnection must submit an application to the electric distribution company for an impact study, including a request for an estimate of the cost of interconnecting the renewable distributed-generation resource to the distribution system. The applicant may request a feasibility study prior to requesting an impact study, but the applicant is not required to do so and may submit an application for an impact study without having obtained a feasibility study. The distribution company shall follow the schedule below for all applications.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Upon receipt of a completed application requesting a feasibility study and receipt of the applicable feasibility study fee, the electric distribution company shall provide a feasibility study to the applicant within thirty (30) days.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Upon receipt of a completed application requesting an impact study and receipt of the applicable impact study fee, the electric distribution company shall provide an impact study within ninety (90) days.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> In anticipation of the electric distribution company needing to add resources that are not currently in Rhode Island or covered in rates, to provide the necessary services to advance the aggressive goals and objectives set forth in this title, the electric distribution company shall be authorized to add up to two (2) incremental employee resources located in Rhode Island that shall be primarily dedicated to servicing Rhode Island applicants and customers in connection with net metering and the development of distributed-generation resources, including the requisite resources to perform impact and feasibility studies for distributed-generation interconnections and to assure that feasibility studies and impact studies, as well as other engineering activity necessary to facilitate the completion of distributed-generation projects in Rhode Island, are implemented and delivered on a timely basis. Prior to new rates going into effect following the company’s next general rate case filing, the cost of the incremental employee resources shall be recovered through rates on an annual basis through an annual reconciliation mechanism, provided that the total amount of fees collected from impact studies and feasibility studies shall be netted against such costs. Only the cost of time and work actually spent on Rhode Island renewable energy project matters shall be included in the annual reconciliation. The commission shall have the authority to review these positions in the electric distribution company’s next general rate case as a cost of service in the same manner as it reviews all other expenses in a rate case to determine whether they should continue. Nothing contained in this section shall preclude the electric distribution company from adding additional resources, subject to commission approval.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the application process and fees set forth in this chapter apply only to interconnections to the distribution system by renewable distributed-generation resources. To the extent that a renewable generation resource seeks an interconnection to the transmission system and the interconnection request is governed by rules and regulations under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the provisions of this chapter shall not apply.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> The rules and fees established in this chapter shall be incorporated within the applicable “Standards for Interconnection of Distributed Generation” approved by the commission.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The electric distribution company may only charge an interconnecting, renewable energy customer for any system modifications to its electric power system specifically necessary for and directly related to the interconnection.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> If the public utilities commission determines that a specific system modification benefiting other customers has been accelerated due to an interconnection request, it may order the interconnecting customer to fund the modification subject to repayment of the depreciated value of the modification as of the time the modification would have been necessary as determined by the public utilities commission. Any system modifications benefiting other customers shall be included in rates as determined by the public utilities commission.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> If an interconnecting, renewable energy customer is required to pay for system modifications and a subsequent renewable energy or commercial customer relies on those modifications to connect to the distribution system within ten (10) years of the earlier interconnecting, renewable energy customer’s payment, the subsequent customer will make a prorated contribution toward the cost of the system modifications that will be credited to the earlier interconnecting, renewable energy customer as determined by the public utilities commission.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> An electric distribution company shall acknowledge to the interconnecting, renewable energy customer receipt of an application to initiate the interconnection process within three (3) business days of receipt. The electric distribution company shall notify the interconnecting, renewable energy customer in writing within ten (10) business days of receipt that the application is or is not complete and, if not, advise what is missing. Any disputes regarding whether and when an application to initiate the interconnection process is complete shall be resolved expeditiously at the public utilities commission. The maximum time allowed between the date of the completed application and delivery of an executable interconnection service agreement shall be one hundred seventy-five (175) calendar days or two hundred (200) calendar days if a detailed study is required. All electric distribution company system modifications must be completed by the date which is the later of: (1) No longer than two hundred seventy (270) calendar days, or three hundred sixty (360) calendar days if substation work is necessary, from the date of the electric distribution company’s receipt of the interconnecting, renewable energy customer’s executed interconnection service agreement; or (2) The interconnecting, renewable energy customer’s agreed-upon extension of the time between the execution of the interconnection service agreement and interconnection as set forth in writing. All deadlines herein are subject to all payments being made in accordance with the distributed-generation interconnection tariff on file with the public utilities commission and the interconnection service agreement. These system modification deadlines cannot be extended due to customer delays in providing required information, all of which must be requested and obtained before completion of the impact study. The deadlines for completion of system modifications will be extended only to the extent of events that are clearly not under the control of the electric distribution company, such as extended prohibitive weather, union work stoppage or force majeure, or third-party delays, including, without limitation, delays due to ISO-NE requirements not attributable to electric distribution company actions, and that cannot be resolved despite commercially reasonable efforts. The electric distribution company shall notify the customer of the start of any claimed deadline extension as soon as practicable, its cause and when it concludes, all in writing. Any actual damages that a court of competent jurisdiction orders the electric distribution company to pay to an interconnecting, renewable energy customer as a direct result of the electric distribution company’s failure to comply with the requirements of this subsection shall be payable by its shareholders and may not be recovered from customers, provided that the total amount of damages awarded for any and all such claims shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to the amount of the incentive the electric distribution company would have earned as provided for in §§ 39-26.6-12(j)(3) and 39-26.1-4 in the year in which the system modifications were required to be completed. In no event shall the electric distribution company be liable to the interconnecting, renewable energy customer for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages of any kind whatsoever as a result of the electric distribution company’s failure to comply with this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> On or before September 1, 2017, the public utilities commission shall initiate a docket to establish metrics for the electric distribution company’s performance in meeting the time frames set forth herein and in the distributed-generation interconnection standards approved by the public utilities commission. The public utilities commission may include incentives and penalties in the performance metrics.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The proposed interconnection of any new renewable energy resource that replaces the same existing renewable energy resource of the same or less nameplate capacity that has been in operation in the twelve (12) months preceding notification of the replacement shall be subject to a sixty-day (60) review. The purpose of such sixty-day (60) review is to allow the electric distribution company to determine whether any system modifications are required to support the interconnection of the replacement renewable energy resource. If there is a need for system modifications because of an interconnection policy change implemented by the electric distribution company, then the system modification may be included in rates as determined by the public utilities commission. If there is a need for system modifications only because of a change in the rating or utility disturbance response that adversely affects the impact of the facility on the distribution system, then the interconnecting, renewable energy customer shall be responsible for the cost of the system modifications.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> “Community remote net-metering system” means a facility generating electricity using an eligible net-metering resource that allocates net-metering credits to a minimum of one account for a system associated with low- or moderate-income housing eligible credit recipients, or three (3) eligible credit-recipient customer accounts, provided that no more than fifty percent (50%) of the credits produced by the system are allocated to one eligible credit recipient, and provided further at least fifty percent (50%) of the credits produced by the system are allocated to the remaining eligible credit recipients in an amount not to exceed that which is produced annually by twenty-five kilowatt (25 KW) AC capacity. The community remote net-metering system may transfer credits to eligible credit recipients in an amount that is equal to or less than the sum of the usage of the eligible credit recipient accounts measured by the three-year (3) average annual consumption of energy over the previous three (3) years. A projected annual consumption of energy may be used until the actual three-year (3) average annual consumption of energy over the previous three (3) years at the eligible credit recipient accounts becomes available for use in determining eligibility of the generating system. The community remote net-metering system may be owned by the same entity that is the customer of record on the net-metered account or may be owned by a third party.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The Rhode Island infrastructure bank or a third-party capital provider may enter into a financing agreement with a qualifying PACE property owner. After such agreement is entered into, and upon notice from the Rhode Island infrastructure bank, the PACE municipality shall: (i) Place a caveat on the land records indicating that a PACE assessment and lien is anticipated upon completion of the PACE project for such property; or (ii) At the direction of the Rhode Island infrastructure bank, levy the PACE assessment and file a lien on the land records on the estimated costs of the PACE project prior to the completion or upon the completion of said PACE project.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> PACE assessments levied pursuant to this chapter and the interest, fees, and any penalties thereon shall constitute a lien against the qualifying PACE property on which they are made until they are paid. The lien shall be collected in the same manner as the property taxes of the PACE municipality on real property, including, in the event of default or delinquency, with respect to any penalties, fees, and remedies. Each lien may be recorded and released in the manner provided for property tax liens and if the property is commercial property as defined herein, it shall be subject to the consent of existing mortgage holders. The PACE lien shall take precedence over all other liens or encumbrances except a lien for taxes of the municipality on real property, or if the subject property is residential property as defined herein, the PACE lien shall be subject to any prior recorded mortgage which lien for taxes or pre-recorded residential mortgage shall have priority over the PACE-assessment lien. To the extent PACE assessments are paid in installments and any such installment is not paid when due, the PACE-assessment lien may be foreclosed to the extent of any unpaid installment payments and any penalties, interest, and fees related thereto. In the event the PACE-assessment lien is foreclosed, the PACE-assessment lien shall survive the judgment of foreclosure to the extent of any unpaid installment payments of the PACE assessment secured by the PACE-assessment lien that were not the subject of such judgment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Any PACE municipality may assign to the Rhode Island infrastructure bank any and all liens filed by the PACE municipality, as provided in the written agreement between the participating municipality and the Rhode Island infrastructure bank. The Rhode Island infrastructure bank may sell or assign, for consideration, any and all liens received from the participating municipality. The consideration received by the Rhode Island infrastructure bank shall be negotiated between the Rhode Island infrastructure bank and the assignee. The assignee or assignees of the liens shall have and possess the same powers and rights at law or in equity as the Rhode Island infrastructure bank and the participating municipality and its tax collector would have had if the lien had not been assigned with regard to the precedence and priority of the lien, the accrual of interest, and the fees and expenses of collection. The assignee shall have the same rights to enforce the liens as any private party holding a lien on real property, including, but not limited to, foreclosure and a suit on the debt. Costs and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the assignee as a result of any foreclosure action or other legal proceeding brought pursuant to this section and directly related to the proceeding shall be taxed in the proceeding against each person having title to any property subject to the proceedings. The costs and fees may be collected by the assignee at any time after demand for payment has been made by the assignee.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Each year, for a period of at least five (5) program years, the electric distribution company shall file tariffs with the commission that are designed to provide a multiyear stream of performance-based incentives to eligible renewable-distributed-generation projects for a term of years, under terms and conditions set forth in the tariffs and approved by the commission. The tariffs shall set forth the rights and obligations of the owner of the distributed-generation project and the conditions upon which payment of performance-based incentives by the electric distribution company will be paid. The tariffs shall include the non-price conditions set forth in §§ 39-26.2-7(2)(i) — (vii) for small distributed-generation projects (other than small- and medium-scale solar) and large distributed-generation projects; provided, however, that the time periods for the projects to reach ninety percent (90%) of output shall be extended to twenty-four (24) months (other than eligible anaerobic-digestion projects, which shall be thirty-six (36) months, and eligible small-scale hydro, which shall be forty-eight (48) months). The non-price conditions in the tariffs for small- and medium-scale solar shall take into account the different circumstances for distributed-generation projects of the smaller sizes.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> In addition to the tariff(s), the filing shall include the rules governing the solicitation and enrollment process. The solicitation rules will be designed to ensure the orderly functioning of the distributed-generation growth program and shall be consistent with the legislative purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> In proposing the tariff(s) and solicitation rules applicable to each year, the tariff(s) and rules shall be developed by the electric distribution company and will be reviewed by the office and the board before being sent to the commission for its approval. The proposed tariffs shall include the ceiling prices and term lengths for each tariff that are recommended by the board. The term lengths shall be from fifteen (15) to twenty (20) years; provided, however, that the board may recommend shorter terms for small-scale solar projects. Whatever term lengths between fifteen (15) and twenty (20) years are chosen for any given tariff, the evaluation of the bids for that tariff shall be done on a consistent basis such that the same term lengths for competing bids are used to determine the winning bids.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The board shall use the same standards for setting ceiling prices as set forth in § 39-26.2-5. In setting the ceiling prices, the board may specifically consider:</p>

<p class="p6">It is the intention of the general assembly in enacting this chapter that the developers, owners, investors, customers, and lenders of the distributed-generation projects receiving performance-based incentives under the tariffs be able to rely on the tariffs for the entire term of the applicable tariff for purposes of obtaining financing. Consistent with that intention and expectation, the terms under the tariffs for a given program year, once approved by the commission, shall not be altered in any way that would undermine such reliance on those tariffs during the applicable terms of the tariffs; and in no circumstance will the performance-based incentive rate paid to a renewable energy project developer or owner be reduced during the term of the tariff once a renewable energy project has qualified to receive a tariff under the terms of this chapter.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> Before the third, fourth, and fifth program years, each year the board shall review the conditions specified in subsection (f) of this section and make a recommendation to the commission for findings as to whether they have been met for the applicable year. The recommendation shall be filed with the commission, with copies to the office and the electric distribution company, and any person who has made a written request to the commission to be included in such notification, such list which may be obtained from the commission clerk, and a notice of such filing shall be posted by the commission on its website. If no party files an objection to the recommended findings within ten (10) business days of the posting, the commission may accept them without hearings. If an objection is filed with a reasonable explanation for its basis, the commission shall hold hearings and make the factual determination of whether the conditions have been met.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> In the event that the conditions in subsection (f) of this section have not been met for any program year, then the board and the commission shall take into account the factors set forth below in setting the annual MW target for the following year. In addition, for every program year the board and the commission shall take into account these factors in setting the class MW targets, and the enrollment MW targets for the following year: (1) That the new annual, class, and enrollment levels reasonably assure that competition among projects for the applicable bidding classifications remains robust and likely to yield reasonable and competitive program costs; (2) That, assuming prudent management of the program, the electric distribution company should be able to perform the studies and system upgrades on a timely basis necessary to accommodate the number of applications associated with the targets without materially adversely affecting other electric-distribution construction projects needed to provide reliable and safe electric-distribution service; and (3) Any other reasonable factors that are consistent with the legislative purpose of this chapter as set forth herein, including the program purpose to facilitate the development of renewable distributed generation in the load zone of the electric distribution company at reasonable cost.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> The renewable energy growth program is intended to achieve at least an aggregate amount of one hundred sixty nameplate megawatts (160 MW) over five (5) years, plus any shortfall amount added in pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. However, after the second program year, the board may, based on market data and other information available to it, including pricing received during previous program years, recommend changes to the annual target for any program year above or below the specified targets in subsection (c) of this section if the board concludes that market conditions are likely to produce favorably low or unfavorably high target pricing during the upcoming program year, provided that the recommendation may not result in the five-year (5), one-hundred-sixty-megawatt-nameplate (160 MW) target, plus any shortfall added pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, being exceeded. Any megawatt reduction in an annual target shall be added to the target in the fifth year of the program (and any subsequent years if necessary) such that the overall program target of one-hundred-sixty-megawatt-nameplate (160 MW) capacity, plus any shortfall added pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, is achieved. In considering these issues, the board and the commission may take into account the reasonableness of current pricing and its impact on all electric distribution customers and the legislative purpose of this chapter as set forth herein, including the program purpose to facilitate the development of renewable distributed generation in the load zone of the electric distribution company at reasonable cost.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Large-scale and commercial-scale solar projects and distributed-generation projects for other eligible technologies shall bid a price-per-kilowatt-hour for the entire output of the facility (net of any station service) that shall not exceed the applicable ceiling price. Small-scale and medium-scale solar projects will submit an enrollment application to receive a standard performance-based incentive for the period of years in the applicable tariff, that shall be a price-per-kilowatt-hour for the entire output of the facility. Except for megawatts that may be allocated to the energy-efficiency program pursuant to § 39-26.6-19, small- and medium-scale projects shall be selected on a first-come, first-served basis, or by means of a commission-approved lottery system, or such other method as may be recommended by the board and approved by the commission.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Except for the first program year, the board shall determine, subject to commission approval, the standard performance-based incentive for small- and medium-sized solar projects from the average bid price from the last two (2) procurement enrollments conducted in the commercial-scale and/or large-scale solar projects class. For the first program year, the board may derive the standard performance incentive for small- and medium-sized solar projects from the bidding data obtained from the distributed-generation program in effect in 2014 under the provisions of chapter 26.2 of this title until there is bidding data from the first procurement under the new program which shall then be used to set a new standard performance incentive. The standard performance incentive may be set at a higher rate than payments for commercial-scale and large-scale solar projects in order to take into account the potentially higher per-unit cost of smaller projects. The standard performance incentive also shall be adjusted upward or downward, as needed, in order to take into account the term length over which the incentive shall be paid for the small- and medium-scale solar projects if such terms are different than the terms applicable to the classes from which the standard performance incentive was derived.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> For each program year, the board shall recommend to the commission a standard performance incentive for each of the small-scale and medium-scale solar project classifications. Upon receiving the recommendations from the board, the commission shall open a docket to consider the recommendations or address the recommendations in its approval process for the program year in a consolidated docket as provided in § 39-26.6-10. The commission shall issue its order approving the recommendations no later than concurrently with approval of the entire program and tariffs applicable to the program year; provided, however, that the commission may make modifications or changes to the board’s recommendations consistent with the legislative purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> If after the first program year, the applications for the medium-scale solar projects are significantly over-subscribed, then the board and the electric distribution company, in consultation with the office, may propose to the commission a bidding process for medium-scale projects or a subset of the medium-scale projects under which project selections would be made based on the lowest bids, rather than first-come, first-served or such other method previously approved by the commission. The commission shall approve the proposal from the board and electric company within ninety (90) days; provided, however, that the commission may make changes to the proposal consistent with the legislative purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The commission shall approve the bidding process for medium-scale solar projects recommended by the board only if the commission finds that such bidding process is in a sufficiently simple form that is not administratively burdensome to bidders, and will not have the effect of discouraging participation in the distributed-generation growth program by developers of medium-scale solar projects that may be unrepresented by counsel.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Each enrollment shall be open for a two-week (2) period during which the electric distribution company is required to receive standard short-form applications. The standard short-form application shall require the applicant to provide the following information: the project owner’s identity; the location of the proposed project; the nameplate capacity of the proposed project; and renewable energy class of the proposed project. The standard short-form application shall allow project owners to provide additional information relative to the permitting, financial feasibility, ability to build, and timing for deployment of the proposed projects. The applicant must submit an affidavit with the standard short-form application confirming that the project is not in violation of the rules that prohibit project segmentation, as set forth in § 39-26.6-9.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> For large distributed-generation projects only, the standard short-form application shall also require the applicant to bid a bundled price that applies to the energy, renewable energy certificates, and all other environmental attributes and market products that are available, or may become available, from the distributed-generation facility on a per-kilowatt-hour basis measured from the output of the project. At the election of the electric distribution company, and subject to the approval of the commission, the bid may be required to include the sale of capacity.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> For (i) Small distributed-generation projects other than small-scale and medium-scale solar projects; and (ii) Large distributed-generation projects, the electric distribution company shall select projects based on the lowest proposed prices received that do not exceed the ceiling price from the distributed-generation projects that meet the requirements of all applicable tariffs and regulations, and meet the criteria of the renewable energy class in effect, until the class target is met. Performance-based incentives shall be awarded to the winning bidders based on their bids submitted.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> For small-scale and medium-scale solar projects, awards shall be made in the manner set forth in §§ 39-26.6-15 and 39-26.6-19.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> If there are more projects bidding at the same price than the capacity that is specified for a class target, the electric distribution company shall, in consultation with the board and the office, select first those projects that appear to be the furthest along in development and that are most likely to be deployed. Those projects that are likely to be deployed at the earliest time shall be selected first. To the extent the electric distribution company is unable to make a clear distinction on this basis, the electric distribution company shall report its findings to the board and not award bids for those projects that are tied on pricing. In that case, the board may take such action as it deems appropriate for the selection of projects, including seeking more information from the projects.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Should the electric distribution company determine that it has made sufficient awards to achieve a program-year class target, it shall immediately report this fact to the board, the office, and the commission, and may cease making awards for that renewable energy class for the remainder of the program year. In any event, the electric distribution company may exceed the renewable energy class target if the last award may cause the total purchased to exceed the target.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> The board, the office, and the electric distribution company shall enter into a memorandum of understanding regarding the sharing of the information and data related to the renewable energy growth program, including, without limitation, information on bids received, details regarding project ownership, and pricing. At the request of the board, the office, or the electric distribution company, the commission shall have the authority to protect from public disclosure individual bid information for any projects that have not been awarded performance-based incentives.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> The electric distribution company is authorized to award bids up to the applicable ceiling price. As long as the terms of the tariff are met, and the pricing is no higher than the applicable ceiling price, such awards shall be deemed prudent and approved by the commission for purposes of recovering the costs in rates.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> With respect to any procurement that includes bids from pre-existing, hydroelectric generation, the electric distribution company, in consultation with the office, shall have the authority to accept the applicant’s representation that its investment is material, within the meaning of § 39-26.6-3(6). However, if the electric distribution company or the office questions whether the material investment standard has been met or the application is otherwise rejected, the application shall be submitted to the board for review and the board shall draw its own conclusion and make a recommendation to the commission at the time the commission is approving awards from the procurement to which the application pertains. The commission shall have the final authority to make the determination as to whether the material investment standard has been met. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude a project developer from seeking a preliminary confirmation of eligibility for the material-investment exemption from the electric distribution company, the office, and the board prior to the submittal of a bid. In such case, if there is any disagreement, the final determination shall be submitted to the commission.</p>

In this case, the electric distribution company will propose criteria for eligibility for performance-based incentives for solar that require certain energy-efficiency standards be met at the customer location in order to be eligible for performance-based incentives for a small-scale and/or medium-scale solar installation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The electric distribution company must also include program parameters that do not disrupt competition among small-scale and/or medium-scale solar developers, including, without limitation, safeguards against any one, or subset of, developers in this market being given exclusive rights or other market advantages over competitors.

<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The performance-based incentive shall be the price-per-kilowatt-hour that was bid and awarded, or established as a standard incentive, as applicable. The performance-based incentive shall be applied as a price-per-kilowatt-hour for all kilowatt-hours actually produced from the distributed generation (net of station service, if any) for the term of years specified in the applicable tariff, less the value of any kilowatt-hour charges that were offset by any net metering (if applicable) for the host customer associated with the distributed generation for the billing month; provided, however, if the value of kilowatt-hour charges that otherwise would be offset by net metering in a given month exceeds the total value of the performance-based incentive for the month, the customer shall not be subject to any additional charge, nor receive any additional net-metering credit, for the difference between the performance-based incentive value and net-metering value for the month.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Except as provided herein for residential small-scale solar projects, in every case where a distributed-generation project can be configured for net metering, it shall be the election of the owner of the generation to choose one of two (2) separate methods through which the owner will be compensated for the performance-based incentive:</p>

<p class="p6">In order to provide the electric distribution company with the flexibility to encourage distributed-generation projects to be located in designated geographical areas within its load zone where there is an identifiable system benefit, reliability benefit, or cost savings to the distribution system in that geographical area, the electric distribution company, in consultation with the board and the office, may propose to include an incentive-payment adder to the bid price of any winning bidder that proposes a distributed-generation project in the desired geographical area. The electric distribution company also may propose other incentive payments to achieve other technical or public policy objectives that provide identifiable benefits to customers. Any incentive-payment adders must be approved by the commission, and shall not be counted as part of the bid price when the bids are selected at an enrollment event.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> On or after July 1, 2015, the commission shall open a docket to consider rate design and distribution cost allocation among rate classes in light of net metering and the changing distribution system that is expected to include more distributed-energy resources, including, but not limited to, distributed generation. The commission will determine the appropriate cost responsibility and contributions to the operation, maintenance, and investment in the distribution system that is relied upon by all customers, including, without limitation, non-net-metered and net-metered customers. In that docket, the commission shall require the electric distribution company to file a revenue-neutral allocated-cost-of-service study for all rate classes and a proposal for new rates for all customers in each rate class. The electric distribution company shall use the distribution-revenue requirement upon which the then-current distribution rates were set. The electric distribution company may use the allocated cost of service that was filed with the compliance filing from the rate case when the then-current distribution rates were set. The commission may also address the rate design for the equitable recovery of costs associated with energy efficiency and any renewable energy programs that are recovered in rates.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> In establishing any new rates the commission may deem appropriate, the commission shall take into account and balance the following factors:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The benefits of distributed-energy resources;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The distribution services being provided to net-metered customers when the distributed generation is not producing electricity;</p>

The rates shall be designed for each proposed rate class in accordance with industry-standard, cost-allocation principles. The commission may consider any reasonable rate design options, including without limitation, fixed charges, minimum-monthly charges, demand charges, volumetric charges, or any combination thereof, with the purpose of assuring recovery of costs fairly across all rate classes.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The commission shall issue an order in the docket by no later than March 1, 2016. Any new rates shall take effect for usage on and after April 1, 2016; provided, however, that the electric distribution company may seek an extension if necessary to make the billing system changes necessary to implement a new rate structure. After new, revenue-neutral rates are set in the docket specified above, the commission may approve changes to the rate design in any future distribution-base-rate cases when a fully allocated embedded cost-of-service study is being reviewed in the rate case, subject to the principles set forth in subsection (b) of this section.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Three (3) months prior to the beginning of the first program year, the electric distribution company shall file a forecast of the total amount of payments that is likely to be paid out to distributed-generation projects in the coming program year within the electric distribution company’s load zone, along with any costs permitted for recovery pursuant to §§ 39-26.6-4, 39-26.6-13 and 39-26.6-18. The total of all forecasted payments and costs shall be aggregated, net of forecasted revenues from the sale of the energy, renewable energy certificates, and any other market products from the distributed-generation projects participating in the performance-based incentive program. The forecasted net-aggregate amount shall be used to design a fixed monthly charge per customer to recover the net forecast in rates charged to all distribution customers during the prospective calendar year, which fixed charge may be different by rate class in order to reasonably and equitably spread the program costs across all customer classes. The fixed rate shall stay in effect until changed after the first reconciliation filing set forth below and the rate reconciliation process shall be repeated annually, as set forth below. The commission, in its discretion, may move the reconciliation of costs and credits under § 39-26.1-5(f) into this reconciliation in order to have one reconciliation of all program costs and credits from the long-term contracting standard, distributed-generation standard contracting, and renewable energy growth program.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Within three (3) months after the end of each program year, the electric distribution company shall reconcile the total amount recovered from distribution customers against the total of net payments and costs for the program year. The electric distribution company shall file the reconciliation with a report, along with a new forecast of payments to be made for the next twelve-month (12) period, net of forecasted revenues for the resale of energy, renewable energy certificates, or any other market attributes sold by the electric distribution company. The forecast shall be used to set a new rate in the same manner as set forth above and the new rate shall remain in effect until rates are reset in the next annual reconciliation and the reconciliation balance shall be reflected in the new rate.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(1) Efficiency standards for certain products sold or installed in the state assure consumers and businesses that such products meet minimum efficiency performance levels, thus reducing energy and water waste and saving consumers and businesses money on utility bills.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(2) Such efficiency standards save energy and thus reduce climate-changing emissions and other environmental impacts associated with the production, distribution, and use of electricity, natural gas, and other fuels.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(3) Such efficiency standards save water, mitigating the effects of short- and long-term droughts and helping to conserve fresh water supplies.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(4) Bill savings resulting from more efficient products benefit all consumers but are especially important to low-income families, who spend a disproportionate share of their income on utilities. Efficiency standards also help the state and local economies because bill savings can be spent on local goods and services.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(5) Energy and water savings help reduce or delay the need for expensive investments in new power plants, transmission lines, and distribution system upgrades, new and expanded gas pipelines, and water and sewer infrastructure improvements.”</p>

<p class="p6">The Rhode Island general assembly finds that growth and enhancement of services using internet protocol technology provide Rhode Island consumers more choice in voice, data, and video services than at any other time. The proliferation of new technologies and applications and the growing number of providers developing and offering innovative services using internet protocol are due in large part to little barrier to investment, including freedom from state laws and regulations governing traditional telephone service, that these technologies have enjoyed in Rhode Island, as well as recognition that federal law is more uniform in its oversight of internet protocol-enabled services. The economic benefits, including consumer choice, new jobs, and significant capital investment, will be jeopardized and competition minimized by the imposition of traditional state entry, rate, and service-term regulation on voice over internet protocol service and internet protocol-enabled service.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Any municipality exercising the option to convert its lighting equipment pursuant to subsection (a) must compensate the electric distribution company for the original cost, less depreciation and less amortization, of any active or inactive existing public lighting equipment owned by the electric distribution company and installed in the municipality as of the date the municipality exercises its right of acquisition pursuant to subsection (a), net of any salvage value. Upon such payment, the municipality shall have the right to use, alter, remove, or replace the acquired lighting equipment in any way the municipality deems appropriate. Any contract a municipality enters for the services must require appropriate levels of training and certification of personnel providing pole service for public and worker safety, evidence of twenty-four-hour (24) call capacity, and a committed timely response schedule for both emergency and routine outages. The municipality may also request that the electric company remove any part of such lighting equipment that it does not acquire from the electric distribution company in which case the municipality shall reimburse the electric distribution company the cost of removal by the electric distribution company, along with the original cost, less depreciation, of the removed part, net of any salvage value.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> When a municipality exercises its option pursuant to subsection (a), the municipality will notify the electric distribution company of any alterations to street and area lighting inventory within sixty (60) days of the alteration. The electric distribution company will then adjust its monthly billing determinations to reflect the alteration within sixty (60) days.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> When a municipality exercises its option pursuant to subsection (a), anyone other than the electric distribution company controlling the right to use space on any pole, lamp post, or other mounting surface previously used by the electric distribution company in the municipality shall allow the municipality to assume the rights and obligations of the electric distribution company with respect to the space for the unexpired term of any lease, easement, or other agreement under which the electric distribution company used the space; provided, however, that:</p>

Rhode Island is one of the foremost states with broadband coverage and capability and must continue to lead in the advancement of new technology. Small wireless facilities are critical to delivering wireless access to advanced technology, broadband and 911 services to homes, businesses, and schools in the state. To ensure that the state and those who live and work here continue to benefit from these advanced services as soon as possible and to ensure that providers of wireless services have a fair and predictable process for the deployment of small wireless facilities, the general assembly enacts this ‘Rhode Island Small Cell Siting Act’, which specifies how local authorities may regulate the collocation of small wireless facilities and small wireless facility networks.”</p>

<p class="p6">An authority may require a person to obtain a building, electrical, or a public right-of-way use or work permit to collocate small wireless facilities on authority poles or authority structures, provided such permits are of general applicability and do not apply exclusively to wireless facilities. An authority may not require a permit, other than a public right-of-way work permit, for routine maintenance on a previously approved small wireless facility or to replace a small wireless facility with a facility of substantially similar or smaller size and weight. An authority shall accept an application for, process, and issue a permit allowed under this chapter as follows:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> An authority shall receive applications for, and process and issue permits for, collocating small wireless facilities on a nondiscriminatory basis and in substantially the same manner as the permitting of other applicants within the jurisdiction of the authority. An applicant for a collocation permit shall not be required to provide more information to obtain a permit than communications service providers that are not wireless providers. If consistent with the preceding sentence, an authority may require an application to include information sufficient to determine whether the collocation meets applicable building or electrical codes or, if applicable, standards for construction in the right-of-way, provided such codes and standards are of general applicability.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> An authority may charge a fee to process an application to collocate a small wireless facility. The fee shall be no greater than the reasonable, direct and actual costs incurred by the authority to process the application, excluding any fees for review of an application charged by third parties on a contingency basis or a result-based arrangement, and further excluding any costs already recovered by existing fees, rates, or taxes paid by a wireless provider. The application processing fee shall be no greater than the application processing fee, if any, charged by the authority to persons seeking to place a pole in the public way. Except as provided in § 39-32-5, an applicant shall not be required to pay any additional fees or charges, or perform or provide any services not directly related to the collocation, in order to collocate small wireless facilities.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> At its discretion, an applicant shall be allowed to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit to collocate small wireless facilities at multiple locations within the jurisdiction of the authority.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> Notwithstanding the provisions of § 39-32-2(c), a permit for a collocation within a historic district as defined in § 45-24.1-1.1 shall be subject to historic district commission review and approval, in accordance with standards to be adopted by regulation or rule. The standards may include that a collocation meet reasonable design, context, color, and stealth and concealment requirements and make reasonable accommodation for location within the district. The historic district commission may waive one or more standards upon a showing that the standard(s) are not reasonably compatible with the particular location of a small wireless facility, or that the standard(s) impose an excessive expense. The waiver shall be granted or denied within forty-five (45) days after the date of the request for waiver.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> An authority shall approve an application for a permit under this chapter unless the collocation does not meet applicable building or electrical codes or, if applicable, standards for construction in the right-of-way, provided such codes and standards are of general applicability. The authority must document the basis for any denial, including the specific code provisions or standards on which the denial was based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the authority denies an application. The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the authority and resubmit the application within thirty (30) days of the denial without paying an additional processing fee. The authority shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30) days. Any subsequent denial shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the original denial. Where one or more locations addressed in a consolidated application do not meet the criteria of this section, the authority shall allow the application as to all other locations.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> An application shall be deemed approved if the authority fails to approve or deny the application within sixty (60) days of submission. If the authority notifies the applicant within fourteen (14) days after the initial submission that the application is incomplete and reasonably identifies at that time the information that is lacking, the time period stated above shall be tolled during the time it takes the applicant to respond. No other request for additional information shall toll such time periods.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> A person whose application or revised application is denied by an authority may appeal to the superior court within thirty (30) days of the denial. The superior court shall have jurisdiction to determine all disputes arising under this chapter.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Within six (6) months of receiving its first request to collocate small wireless facilities on authority poles located within the public rights-of-way, but in no event later than April 1, 2018, an authority shall establish, by ordinance, regulation, or rule, nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral, and commercially reasonable rates, terms, and conditions for such collocation that are consistent with the provisions of this chapter. Aside from the application processing fee allowed under § 39-32-3, an authority shall not charge on an annual recurring basis more for such a collocation than one hundred and fifty dollars ($150) or the rate produced by applying the formula adopted by the Federal Communications Commission for telecommunications attachments under 47 U.S.C. § 224(e). The fee limitation shall not apply to authority structures.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> An authority shall authorize the collocation of small wireless facilities on authority poles not located within the public rights-of-way and on authority structures to the same extent the authority permits access to the poles and structures for other commercial projects or uses, and may authorize the collocation if the authority has not previously permitted access. The collocation shall be subject to reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates, terms, and conditions as provided by ordinance or in one or more agreements between the wireless provider and the authority. An authority may not charge on an annual recurring basis more for such a collocation than the amount charged for similar commercial projects or uses to occupy or use the same amount of space on similarly situated property.</p>

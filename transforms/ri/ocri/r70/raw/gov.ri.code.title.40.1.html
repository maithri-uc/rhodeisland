<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A cause of action may lie against the director of the Rhode Island department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 6000-81 (1983) (DDA), for the denial of proper treatment of a mentally disturbed minor, although the minor has never been the beneficiary of services funded even in part by the DDA. Since any person who falls within the definition of “developmental disability” for the purposes of the DDA, 42 U.S.C. § 6001(7) (1983), (as does such a minor) is almost certainly “mentally disabled” within the meaning of § 40.1-5-3(1) (now (a)), the director has authority to ensure the proper administration of the DDA in Rhode Island.

For these purposes, the director is empowered to subpoena witnesses; compel their attendance; administer oaths to witnesses; examine witnesses under oath; and require the production of any books, documents, papers, or records deemed relevant to the inquiry of investigation.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Rhode Island department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals is charged with the execution of all laws relating to the admission and custody of all mentally disabled persons, and § 42-72-18 (transfer of functions) does not transfer or even modify such a responsibility. John V. v. McManus, 580 F. Supp. 549, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19599 (D.R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Federal Cause of Action.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A cause of action may lie against the director of the Rhode Island department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 6000-81 (1983) (DDA), for the denial of proper treatment of a mentally disturbed minor, although the minor has never been the beneficiary of services funded even in part by the DDA. Since any person who falls within the definition of “developmental disability” for the purposes of the DDA, 42 U.S.C. § 6001(7) (1983), (as does such a minor) is almost certainly “mentally disabled” within the meaning of subsection 1, the director has authority to ensure the proper administration of the DDA in Rhode Island. John V. v. McManus, 580 F. Supp. 549, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19599 (D.R.I. 1984).</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The department’s power to establish a maximum-consecutive-work-hours cap for those healthcare employees who work with its custodial patients is not properly arbitrable because arbitration conflicts with the nondelegable managerial duties of the department and its director to provide for the safety and the welfare of the disabled, custodial patients and for the protection of the public health.

If the inpatient hospital admits a child without the crisis intervention and prior authorization from the insurance company or utilization review organization, the hospital will be paid a rate equivalent to an Administratively Necessary Day (AND) for each day that the insurance company or utilization review organization representing the insurance company determines that the child did not meet the inpatient level-of-care criteria. The state shall ensure that this provision is included in all publicly financed contracts and agreements for behavioral health services.

In the case of an individual under eighteen (18) years of age, the notice or withdrawal of notice may be given by either of the persons who made the application for his or her admission, or by a person of equal or closer relationship to the patient, who shall, as well, receive notice from the official in charge indicating a decision to present an application for civil court certification. The official may in his or her discretion refuse to discharge the patient upon notice given by any person other than the person who made the application, and in the event of such a refusal, the person giving notice may apply to a justice of the family court for release of the patient.</p>

The examination shall include an investigation with the prospective patient of (1) What alternatives for admission are available and (2) Why those alternatives are not suitable. The alternatives for admission investigated and reasons for unsuitability, if any, shall be recorded on the patient’s record.

<p class="p6"><b>Civil Liability.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Mental health center possessed neither the legal authority nor the opportunity to exercise control over an outpatient that gave rise to a duty to control the patient to the extent of initiating involuntary commitment proceedings under R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5-7; there was no evidence illustrating what the patient’s condition was when the district court last ordered him into counseling at the center, or what his condition was when he was last treated there, some four months before he attacked plaintiff. Plaintiff also failed to present any physicians’ affidavits in opposition to the center’s motion for summary judgment; thus, a special relationship did not exist that triggered a corresponding duty to control the patient. Santana v. Rainbow Cleaners, Inc., 969 A.2d 653, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 49 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Community mental health center had no duty to exercise control over the outpatient to prevent him from assaulting plaintiff; the relationship between a mental health provider and its patient, in and of itself, was not sufficient to give rise to a duty to control the patient, and the assault was not a foreseeable consequence of the alleged negligent conduct (failure to exercise control by initiating R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5-7 certification proceedings). Further, the outpatient’s liberty rights as expressed in § 40.1-8.5-1(a) had to be protected by following the statutory commitment procedures, and public policy concerns and notions of fairness militated against imposing a duty under the facts of the case. Santana v. Rainbow Cleaners, Inc., 969 A.2d 653, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 49 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a wrongful death action, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-7-1, involving the suicide death of a patient approximately 36 hours after he was discharged from a hospital emergency room, while the doctor should have sought an emergency mental health hold under R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5-7, the trial justice did not err in granting defendants’ R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law because the decedent’s family failed to present expert testimony with respect to the issue of proximate cause. The record was devoid of any expert opinion that the decedent would not have been discharged within 36 hours after his arrival at a mental health facility. Almonte v. Kurl, 46 A.3d 1, 2012 R.I.

The petition may be filed by any person with whom the subject of the petition may reside; or at whose house he or she may be; or the father or mother, husband or wife, brother or sister, or the adult child of the person; the nearest relative if none of the above are available; or his or her guardian; or the attorney general; or a local director of public welfare; or the director of the department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals; the director of the department of human services; or the director of the department of corrections; the director of the department of health; the warden of the adult correctional institutions; the superintendent of the boys training school for youth, or his or her designated agent; or the director of any facility, or his or her designated agent, whether or not the person shall have been admitted and is a patient at the time of the petition.

If the court finds that there is no probable cause to support certification, the petition shall be dismissed, and the person shall be discharged unless the person applies for voluntary admission. However, if the court is satisfied by the testimony that there is probable cause to support certification, a final hearing shall be held not less than seven (7) days, nor more than twenty-one (21) days, after the preliminary hearing, unless continued at the request of counsel for the person, and notice of the date set down for the hearing shall be served on the person.

In either event, and to the extent practicable, the person shall be cared for in a facility that imposes the least restraint upon the liberty of the person consistent with affording him or her the care and treatment necessary and appropriate to his or her condition. No certification shall be made under this section unless and until full consideration has been given by the certifying court to the alternatives to in-patient care, including, but not limited to, a determination of the person’s relationship to the community and to his or her family; of his or her employment possibilities; and of all available community resources, alternate available living arrangements, foster care, community residential facilities, nursing homes, and other convalescent facilities. A certificate ordered pursuant to this section shall be valid for a period of six (6) months from the date of the order.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Release From Commitment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the legislative scheme of the Forensic Commitment is remedial in nature, it should be construed liberally to effectuate its purposes. In re Tavares, 885 A.2d 139, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 200 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5.3-3 provides for a series of procedures, evaluations, and hearings designed to ensure that criminal defendants are competent to stand trial. It therefore serves the dual purposes of protecting a criminal defendant’s right to be competent during his or her trial, while also serving the public’s interest in prosecuting crimes. In re Tavares, 885 A.2d 139, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 200 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Amnesia.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Amnesia, without more, does not per se render an accused incompetent to stand trial. Trial courts should consider each amnesia case on its own merits pursuant to the holding in State v. Cook, 104 R.I. 442 (1968), which requires a meaningful hearing when a defendant’s mental capacity is brought into question. In certain instances a defendant’s amnesia could be so severe as to render him or her unable to understand the proceedings and assist his or her counsel at trial and thus render the defendant incompetent within the meaning of this section. State v. Peabody, 611 A.2d 826, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 149 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Burden of Proof.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is the defendant’s burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is in need of care and treatment by reason of mental disability. State v. Briguglio, 661 A.2d 525, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 195 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Medical Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The decision of the trial court that defendant was incompetent to stand trial was not disturbed where the medical evidence as to his mental capacity was in conflict and some of it supported the court’s decision. State v. Cook, 104 R.I. 442, 244 A.2d 833, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 665 (1968).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The defendant was held competent to stand trial where both psychiatric experts agreed that he understood the role of the parties involved in and the nature of the proceedings, where the more credible expert’s report stated that the defendant admitted that he was able to assist counsel by: (1) discussing the possibility of calling specific alibi witnesses; (2) discussing the significance of a valid search warrant; (3) alerting his counsel to the possible bias of two potential jury members; (4) understanding the term “plea bargain” and discussing the possibility of entering a plea; (5) discussing by means of conversations and notes any discrepancies he noted in some of the witnesses’ testimony; (6) understanding that his defense counsel could use the noted discrepancies on cross-examination to “make some of the witnesses look very bad”; (7) understanding that some of the initial counts of the indictment were dismissed prior to trial, and (8) understanding that he was charged with a very serious offense, and where he was astute enough to believe that his initial attorney was not adequately protecting his rights and, thus, retained more experienced counsel. State v. Buxton, 643 A.2d 172, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 179 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Psychiatric Examination.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where defendant asserts the defense of insanity, a compulsory psychiatric examination by the state is not unconstitutional if the accused is protected from later use at his guilt trial of any inculpatory statements he may make during the examination. State v. Johnson, 119 R.I. 749, 383 A.2d 1012, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 618 (1978).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Admissibility of Evidence.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The use of inculpatory statements made by an accused during a compelled submission to a psychiatric examination by the state is improper if it is intended to prove that the accused performed the act charged; however, when the statement is adduced solely for the purpose of disclosing the information upon which the psychiatrist based his opinion of the accused’s mental status at the time of the alleged act, the admission of such statements is permitted provided that such admission is accompanied by a preventive instruction to the effect that the evidence shall not be regarded as proof of the truth of facts disclosed and may be considered only on the insanity issue. State v. Johnson, 119 R.I. 749, 383 A.2d 1012, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 618 (1978).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>— Notice to Defendant.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section contemplates that an inmate will be informed of the filing of a petition and of the proposed hearing sufficiently prior in time to the date of the hearing, but such information need not amount to legal notice, as it is sufficient if he is afforded an opportunity to testify, to adduce evidence, and to be represented by counsel if desired. Department of Social Welfare v. Genereux, 98 R.I. 334, 201 A.2d 914, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 175 (1964).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Release From Commitment.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5.3-3(i)(3)(i) protects the liberty interests of defendants by ensuring that they are not held indefinitely when they may otherwise be released on bail or treated in a less restrictive environment. In re Tavares, 885 A.2d 139, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 200 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since there was ample evidence to support the court’s finding that involuntarily committed criminal defendant’s competence would be fleeting without the specialized treatment he was receiving at the mental health facility, and that his release or remand to the Adult Correctional Institution would cause him to decompensate to such a degree that he would be unable to retain his competency and proceed to trial, the court did not err in ordering the criminal defendant to continue the commitment notwithstanding his certification of competency. In re Tavares, 885 A.2d 139, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 200 (R.I. 2005).</p>

<p class="p6"><b>“Insanity” Defined.</b></p>

<p class="p6"><b>Judicial Determination.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a transfer of a prisoner to a ward for the criminally insane is ordered, it is the intent of the legislature that the question is to be determined judicially and not medically.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although two periodic reviews after defendant’s appeal of her initial commitment pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5.3-4(e) indicated defendant, who was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity, was experiencing a recurrence of psychotic symptoms, defendant’s appeal was not moot because the initial finding of dangerousness and the commitment order were relevant considerations for purposes of the appeal and defendant had a continuing stake in the outcome. State v. Fuller-Balletta, 996 A.2d 133, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 85 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sufficient evidence supported a trial justice’s determination at an initial commitment hearing that defendant, who was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity, was dangerous and ordered defendant to remain in the custody of the department, pursuant to R.I.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not err by not considering the motivation underlying defendant’s psychotic delusions, which gave rise to an insanity acquittal, for purposes of determining defendant’s dangerousness pursuant to R.I.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice did not err by refusing to order the department to place defendant, who was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity, in a community-based outpatient setting at an initial commitment hearing because R.I. Gen.

<p class="p6"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If a duty were imposed on a mental health center, in the absence of any evidence that an outpatient met the statutory requirements for commitment, then mental health professionals, faced with a choice between initiating certification proceedings and potential liability, would feel pressure to choose the former option. This result would run contrary to the State’s plan for treating patients in a manner that placed the least restraint on their liberty, as required by R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-8.5-1(a). Santana v. Rainbow Cleaners, Inc., 969 A.2d 653, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 49 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Community mental health center had no duty to exercise control over the outpatient to prevent him from assaulting plaintiff; the relationship between a mental health provider and its patient, in and of itself, was not sufficient to give rise to a duty to control the patient, and the assault was not a foreseeable consequence of the alleged negligent conduct (failure to exercise control by initiating R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5-7 certification proceedings). Further, the outpatient’s liberty rights as expressed in § 40.1-8.5-1(a) had to be protected by following the statutory commitment procedures, and public policy concerns and notions of fairness militated against imposing a duty under the facts of the case.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(a)</b> Any resident over eighteen (18) years of age or married residents under eighteen (18), except any resident who is under court-ordered restriction, shall be free to leave any public or private developmental disabilities facility at any time upon giving written or oral notice of the intention to the superintendent or other head of the facility. The superintendent or other head of the facility may restrict the right to leave the facility to normal working hours and weekdays and, in his or her discretion, may require that certain residents give three (3) days’ notice of their intention to leave the facility.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(b)</b> Where persons are required to give three (3) days’ notice of an intention to leave the facility, an examination of the person may be conducted by a team to determine his or her suitability for discharge and to investigate other aspects of his or her case including his or her legal competency and his or her family, home, or community situation to the interest of discharging him or her from the facility.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(c)</b> If, however, the superintendent or other head of the facility determines that discharge of a person who has given three (3) days’ notice would create a likelihood of serious harm to the person himself or herself or to other people by reason of the person’s developmental disability, he or she shall forthwith petition the district court of the judicial district wherein the facility is located to order that the person be further retained as a resident. The superintendent or other head may retain the person until the hearing on the petition has been held.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(d)</b> The court shall cause a notice, as defined in this chapter, of the time and place set for the hearing to be served upon the person and the nearest relative or guardian of the person and the superintendent or other head of the facility. In all hearings, the person shall be represented by legal counsel and may present independent clinical testimony. If the person is found by the court to be indigent, counsel shall be appointed by the court and an independent clinical examination, if requested by counsel for the person, may be provided by the court. The person shall be allowed not less than forty-eight (48) hours after the appearance of counsel on his or her behalf in which to prepare his or her case. The person or his or her representative may request either an open or closed hearing in any court proceedings and the court in its discretion may grant the requests.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(e)</b> If the court finds after the hearing that the discharge of the person would create a likelihood of serious harm to the person himself or herself or to other people by reason of developmental disability, the court shall order that the person be further retained as a resident and the person may not, during the next six-month (6) period, leave the facility except by permission of the superintendent or other head of the facility and no further court action shall be necessary to retain the person during the period. If the court does not so find, it shall order that the person be forthwith discharged.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(f)</b> Any person aggrieved by the decision of a district court order for further residential care under the provisions of this section may appeal the findings and order of the district court de novo to the court having appellate jurisdiction wherein the facility is located. In an appeal to a court under the provisions of this section, the findings and order of the district court may be introduced into evidence by either party. If the appellate court finds after a hearing that discharge of the person would create a likelihood of serious harm to the person him or herself or to other people by reason of developmental disability, the court shall order that the person be further retained as a resident and as such may not, during the next six-month (6) period, leave the facility except by permission of the superintendent or other head of the facility, and no further court order shall be necessary to retain the person during the period.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(g)</b> As the basis for its order the appellate court shall make written findings as to the following:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> That the person is developmentally disabled and the evidence upon which this determination is based; and</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> That, in accordance with the definition of “developmental disability” in 40.1-21-4.3(5) as indicated by the court, the discharge of the person would create a likelihood of serious harm to the person himself or herself or to other people by reason of the developmental disability and the evidence upon which this determination is based; and</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> Any other issue or evidence, which the court deems relevant and necessary for inclusion in its findings. If the court finds that the person does not meet the definition of “developmental disability” in chapter 21 of this title such that there does not exist a likelihood of serious harm to the person himself or herself or to other people by reason of the developmental disability, it shall order that the person be forthwith discharged.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(h)</b> If, at the end of any six-month (6) period of retention, the person is still in need of care and treatment, he or she may, if he or she so desires, be admitted or transferred to other care and treatment in the same or another facility. If the person is unwilling to consent to continued residence, he or she shall be discharged; provided, however, that, if the superintendent or other head of the facility determines that the discharge would create a likelihood of serious harm to the person himself or herself or to other people by reason of developmental disability, he or she shall, prior to the expiration of the six-month (6) period, petition the district court which made the earlier order to order, under the same procedures, that the person be further retained as a resident, and the person may not during the next one-year period leave the facility except by permission of the superintendent or other head of the facility and no further court order shall be necessary to retain the person during the period. The order may be renewed by the court for additional one-year periods on petition of the superintendent or other head of the facility under the same conditions and procedures and opportunity for judicial review as above. The superintendent or other head of the facility shall be immune from civil suit for damages for retaining a person and petitioning the court pursuant to the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="p8"><b>(i)</b> Whenever a person before the district court appears to be developmentally disabled and the court determines either that the crime has not been committed or that there is not sufficient cause to believe that the person is guilty thereof, the court may order evaluation procedures as previously provided in this section, or after a hearing as provided in subsections (d) and (e), and in such a case the criminal action shall terminate.</p>

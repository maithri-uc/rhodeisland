<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The purpose of the Rhode Island works program is to help parents who are eligible for cash assistance to support their children by preparing for, accepting, and retaining employment. It is the intent of the Rhode Island general assembly that the Rhode Island works program shall provide employment and support services along with temporary cash assistance so that parents can participate in the workforce rather than depend on public assistance to support themselves and their children.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Under this law, parents are mandated to enter into an employment plan, as a condition of eligibility for cash assistance, and unless they are found to be temporarily exempt from the work requirements, they must participate in intensive employment services at the department of labor and training as the first step in their employment plan. Because it is believed that employment is the most effective anti-poverty measure, all activities and services provided through the Rhode Island works program are designed to promote economic independence through employment and the development of employment skills and to strengthen families through parental responsibility and short-term assistance.</p>

The amount payable under this section shall be determined with due regard to the income and resources of the deceased and his or her legally-liable relatives, if any, and shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by contributions of friends or other kindred in excess of the maximum total allowable funeral and burial costs established by the department.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Application for payment of funeral and burial expenses shall be made on behalf of a decedent before final funeral arrangements with a funeral director are concluded.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">The New England welfare compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:</p>
<p class="p6"><b>NEW ENGLAND WELFARE COMPACT</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE I. — POLICY, PURPOSE AND SCOPE</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The policy of the states party to this compact is to make welfare services available among the compacting states on the basis of the mutual removal of barriers caused by restrictive residence requirements of the several states. However, it is recognized that law and policy relating generally to the provision of welfare services by a particular state should not be determined by interstate compact and will remain a matter for determination by that party state and its subdivisions.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE II. — WELFARE SERVICE DEFINED</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">As used in this compact, the term “welfare service” means and includes public assistance and child welfare services furnished by a party state or a subdivision thereof, provided that such assistance or service is pursuant to a federally-aided plan, arrangement, or program, and any other category of welfare assistance which is federally aided at the time when a claim of eligibility for assistance or service is made pursuant to this compact.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE III. — PROVISION OF SERVICE</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> No person who has removed himself or herself from his or her place of abode in one party state to another party state shall be ineligible for a welfare service in such other party state because of failure to meet that state’s residence requirements for eligibility. However, if a person is already receiving a welfare service at the time he or she removes himself or herself from his or her place of abode to another party state and if he or she continues to be in need of such service, the party state from which he or she removes himself or herself shall be obligated to bear the cost of such service for ninety (90) days from the date of his or her removal. In any such case, the party state to which the person removes himself or herself shall not be obligated to provide the service at its own expense during such ninety (90)-day period. The cost of providing a welfare service to any person made eligible therefor by reason of this compact shall be charged within a state in accordance with the laws of such state.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> The appropriate official, department or agency of the state where application for a welfare service is made pursuant to this compact shall be entitled to request and receive any pertinent information available from any other party state with respect to such applicant.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE IV. — EXCEPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Nothing in this compact shall be construed to:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> Invalidate any agreement between a party state and a nonparty state relating to the provision neither of welfare services nor to invalidate any statutory authority for such agreements.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> Obligate a party state to provide a welfare service pursuant to this compact, which it does not provide to its own residents.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE V. — COMPACT ADMINISTRATOR</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">In each party state there shall be a compact administrator who shall be the head of the state welfare agency. The compact administrator shall act as general coordinator of activities under the compact in his or her state and cooperate with the compact administrators of other party states. The compact administrators of the respective party states shall have power to promulgate reasonable rules and regulations to carry out the terms and provisions of this compact.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE VI. — ENACTMENT AND WITHDRAWAL</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(a)</b> This compact shall be open to membership by the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. It shall enter into full force and effect as to any two (2) or more of the aforementioned states upon enactment thereof by such states.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> A state party to this compact may withdraw therefrom by enacting a statute repealing the same. Such withdrawal shall take effect six (6) months after notice thereof has been communicated officially and, in writing, to the governors and compact administrators of all other party states. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not affect the rights of any person who is receiving a welfare service pursuant to the provisions of this compact.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE VII. — CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.</p>

Section 9-19-34.1 was not a remedial statute, and the term “income disability act” meant an act that provided income to persons who were disabled; Medicaid did not fit this definition because many Medicaid recipients were not disabled, such as those who were aged 65 or older.

The lien shall not be effective and shall not attach as against the estate of a beneficiary who is survived by a spouse, or a child who is under the age of twenty-one (21), or a child who is blind or permanently and totally disabled as defined in Title XVI of the federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1381 et seq. The lien shall attach against property of a beneficiary, which is included or includable in the decedent’s probate estate, regardless of whether or not a probate proceeding has been commenced in the probate court by the executive office or by any other party. Provided, however, that such lien shall only attach and shall only be effective against the beneficiary’s real property included or includable in the beneficiary’s probate estate if such lien is recorded in the land evidence records and is in accordance with subsection (e).

The statement of claim shall be recorded in the records of land evidence in the town or city where the real property is situated.

Within thirty (30) days of a request by the executive office, an executor or administrator shall complete and send to the executive office a form prescribed by that office and shall provide such additional information as the office may require. In the event a petitioner fails to send a copy of the petition and a copy of the death certificate to the executive office and a decedent has received Medicaid benefits for which the executive office is authorized to recover, no distribution and/or payments, including administration fees, shall be disbursed. Any person and/or entity that receives a distribution of assets from the decedent’s estate shall be liable to the executive office to the extent of such distribution.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> For the purposes of this section, the term community health centers refers to federally qualified health centers and rural health centers.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> To support the ability of community health centers to provide high-quality medical care to patients, the executive office of health and human services (“executive office”) may adopt and implement an alternative payment methodology (APM) for determining a Medicaid per-visit reimbursement for community health centers that is compliant with the prospective payment system (PPS) provided for in the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000. The following principles are to ensure that the APM PPS rate determination methodology is part of the executive office overall value purchasing approach. For community health centers that do not agree to the principles of reimbursement that reflect the APM PPS, EOHHS shall reimburse such community health centers at the federal PPS rate, as required per section 1902(bb)(3) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb)(3). For community health centers that are reimbursed at the federal PPS rate, subsections (d) through (f) of this section apply.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The APM PPS rate determination methodology will (i) Fairly recognize the reasonable costs of providing services. Recognized reasonable costs will be those appropriate for the organization, management, and direct provision of services and (ii) Provide assurances to the executive office that services are provided in an effective and efficient manner, consistent with industry standards. Except for demonstrated cause and at the discretion of the executive office, the maximum reimbursement rate for a service (e.g., medical, dental) provided by an individual community health center shall not exceed one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the median rate for all community health centers within Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Community health centers will cooperate fully and timely with reporting requirements established by the executive office.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Reimbursement rates established through this methodology shall be incorporated into the PPS reconciliation for services provided to Medicaid-eligible persons who are enrolled in a health plan on the date of service. Monthly payments by the executive office related to PPS for persons enrolled in a health plan shall be made directly to the community health centers.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Reimbursement rates established through this methodology shall be incorporated into the actuarially certified capitation rates paid to a health plan. The health plan shall be responsible for paying the full amount of the reimbursement rate to the community health center for each service eligible for reimbursement under the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000. If the health plan has an alternative payment arrangement with the community health center the health plan may establish a PPS reconciliation process for eligible services and make monthly payments related to PPS for persons enrolled in the health plan on the date of service. The executive office will review, at least annually, the Medicaid reimbursement rates and reconciliation methodology used by the health plans for community health centers to ensure payments to each are made in compliance with the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000.</p>

<p class="p6">The legislature hereby finds and declares that preservation of the ability of the private acute-care hospital system of the state to continue to support an increasing uncompensated care burden is of critical importance to the public health and welfare of the citizens of Rhode Island and that implementation of § 1923 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396r-4, which permits the federal government to share in the provision of payments to hospitals that provide a significant amount of uncompensated care, is an effective way for the state to assist the hospitals in continuing to provide uncompensated care.</p>

<p class="p4"><b>40-8.4-2.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Purpose.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">It is the intent of the general assembly to continue to meet the goal established in 1993 pursuant to § 42-12.3-2 to ensure access to comprehensive health care by providing or creating access to health insurance to all Rhode Islanders who are uninsured. Over the course of several years, health insurance through the RIte Care program has been extended to pregnant women and children living in families whose income is less than two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the federal poverty level. Many of the parents of these children are uninsured and without the means to purchase health insurance. Federal funds are available to help pay for health insurance for low-income families through the medical assistance program under § 1931 of Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-1, which de-links medical assistance from cash assistance and allows for expanded income and resource methodologies. It is the intent of the general assembly, therefore, to implement § 1931 of Title XIX of the Social Security Act and, in addition, to provide expanded access to health insurance for eligible families. Federal funds for some children and pregnant women may also be available under Title XXI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1397aa et seq., and it is further the intent of the general assembly to access these funds as appropriate and as authorized in accordance with the legal authority provided by the Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA), and Title XXI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1397aa et seq.</p>

The executive office of health and human services is directed to amend the medical assistance Title XIX state plan and to submit to the United States Department of Health and Human Services an amendment to the RIte Care waiver project to provide for medical assistance coverage to families under this chapter in the same amount, scope, and duration as coverage provided to comparable groups under the waiver.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> <b>Basic RIte Share health insurance premium assistance program.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> Under the terms of Section 1906 of Title XIX of the U.S. Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396e, states are permitted to pay a Medicaid-eligible person’s share of the costs for enrolling in employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) coverage if it is cost-effective to do so. Pursuant to the general assembly’s direction in the Rhode Island health reform act of 2000, the Medicaid agency requested and obtained federal approval under § 1916, 42 U.S.C. § 1396o, to establish the RIte Share premium assistance program to subsidize the costs of enrolling Medicaid-eligible persons and families in employer-sponsored health insurance plans that have been approved as meeting certain cost and coverage requirements. The Medicaid agency also obtained, at the general assembly’s direction, federal authority to require any such persons with access to ESI coverage to enroll as a condition of retaining eligibility providing that doing so meets the criteria established in Title XIX for obtaining federal matching funds.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> <b>Definitions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> “Cost-effective” means that the portion of the ESI that the state would subsidize, as well as wrap-around costs, would on average cost less to the state than enrolling that same person/family in a managed-care delivery system.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> “Cost sharing” means any co-payments, deductibles, or co-insurance associated with ESI.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> “Employee premium” means the monthly premium share a person or family is required to pay to the employer to obtain and maintain ESI coverage.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> “Employer-sponsored insurance” or “ESI” means health insurance or a group health plan offered to employees by an employer.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> “Policy holder” means the person in the household with access to ESI, typically the employee.</p>

The buy-in only applies in instances when household income is above one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the FPL.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(8)</b> “RIte Share premium assistance program” means the Rhode Island Medicaid premium assistance program in which the State pays the eligible Medicaid member’s share of the cost of enrolling in a RIte Share-approved ESI plan. This allows the state to share the cost of the health insurance coverage with the employer.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(9)</b> “RIte Share unit” means the entity within the executive office of health and human services (EOHHS) responsible for assessing the cost-effectiveness of ESI, contacting employers about ESI as appropriate, initiating the RIte Share enrollment and disenrollment process, handling member communications, and managing the overall operations of the RIte Share program.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(10)</b> “Third-party liability (TPL)” means other health insurance coverage.

<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> <b>Approval of health insurance plans for premium assistance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b> The executive office of health and human services shall adopt regulations providing for the approval of employer-based health insurance plans for premium assistance and shall approve employer-based health insurance plans based on these regulations. In order for an employer-based health insurance plan to gain approval, the executive office must determine that the benefits offered by the employer-based health insurance plan are substantially similar in amount, scope, and duration to the benefits provided to Medicaid-eligible persons enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan, when the plan is evaluated in conjunction with available supplemental benefits provided by the office. The office shall obtain and make available to persons otherwise eligible for Medicaid identified in this section as supplemental benefits those benefits not reasonably available under employer-based health insurance plans that are required for Medicaid beneficiaries by state law or federal law or regulation. Once it has been determined by the Medicaid agency that the ESI offered by a particular employer is RIte Share-approved, all Medicaid members with access to that employer’s plan are required to participate in RIte Share. Failure to meet the mandatory enrollment requirement shall result in the termination of the Medicaid eligibility of the policy holder and other Medicaid members nineteen (19) or older in the household who could be covered under the ESI until the policy holder complies with the RIte Share enrollment procedures established by the executive office.</p>

The executive office is further authorized and directed to prioritize investments in home- and community-based care and to maintain the integrity and financial viability of all current long-term-care services while pursuing this goal.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The reformed long-term-care system rebalancing goal is person-centered and encourages individual self-determination, family involvement, interagency collaboration, and individual choice through the provision of highly specialized and individually tailored home-based services. Additionally, individuals with severe behavioral, physical, or developmental disabilities must have the opportunity to live safe and healthful lives through access to a wide range of supportive services in an array of community-based settings, regardless of the complexity of their medical condition, the severity of their disability, or the challenges of their behavior. Delivery of services and supports in less-costly and less-restrictive community settings will enable children, adolescents, and adults to be able to curtail, delay, or avoid lengthy stays in long-term-care institutions, such as behavioral health residential-treatment facilities, long-term-care hospitals, intermediate-care facilities, and/or skilled nursing facilities.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Pursuant to federal authority procured under § 42-7.2-16, the executive office of health and human services is directed and authorized to adopt a tiered set of criteria to be used to determine eligibility for services.

The executive office is authorized to adopt clinical and/or functional criteria for admission to a nursing facility, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities that are more stringent than those employed for access to home- and community-based services. The executive office is also authorized to promulgate rules that define the frequency of re-assessments for services provided for under this section. Levels of care may be applied in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The executive office shall continue to apply the level-of-care criteria in effect on June 30, 2015, for any recipient determined eligible for and receiving Medicaid-funded long-term services and supports in a nursing facility, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities on or before that date, unless:</p>

For the purposes of this section, a failed community placement, as defined in regulations promulgated by the executive office, shall be considered a condition of clinical eligibility for the highest level of care. The executive office shall confer with the long-term-care ombudsperson with respect to the determination of a failed placement under the ombudsperson’s jurisdiction. Should any Medicaid recipient eligible for a nursing facility, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities as of June 30, 2015, receive a determination of a failed community placement, the recipient shall have access to the highest level of care; furthermore, a recipient who has experienced a failed community placement shall be transitioned back into his or her former nursing home, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities whenever possible. Additionally, residents shall only be moved from a nursing home, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities in a manner consistent with applicable state and federal laws.</p>

The resulting single home- and community-based services system shall replace and supersede all 42 U.S.C. § 1396n programs when fully implemented. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the resulting single program home- and community-based services system shall include the continued funding of assisted-living services at any assisted-living facility financed by the Rhode Island housing and mortgage finance corporation prior to January 1, 2006, and shall be in accordance with chapter 66.8 of title 42 as long as assisted-living services are a covered Medicaid benefit.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The executive office is authorized to promulgate rules that permit certain optional services including, but not limited to, homemaker services, home modifications, respite, and physical therapy evaluations to be offered to persons at risk for Medicaid-funded long-term care subject to availability of state-appropriated funding for these purposes.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> To promote the expansion of home- and community-based service capacity, the executive office is authorized to pursue payment methodology reforms that increase access to homemaker, personal care (home health aide), assisted living, adult supportive-care homes, and adult day services, as follows:</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> An estimated one hundred and forty-eight thousand (148,000) persons in Rhode Island are providing care at any one time to persons living in the community. The estimated value of their unpaid contributions in 2009 was one billion eight hundred eighty million dollars ($1,880,000,000).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Family or other caregivers who provide the majority of care in the home are frequently under substantial physical, psychological, and financial stress. The stress, if unrelieved by support for the caregiver, may lead to premature or unnecessary nursing home and institutional placement and health and financial burdens for the caregiver.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Respite care and other community-based supportive services for the family caregiver can relieve some of the stresses faced by caregivers; maintain and strengthen the family structure; postpone or prevent institutionalization; and lead to better outcomes for both the caregiver and care recipient.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The percent of Rhode Islanders age sixty-five (65) years of age and older is projected to grow from fourteen percent (14%) of the state population in 2010 to twenty-one percent (21%) by 2030. As persons age, they have greater dependency needs and an increased need for long-term-care services and support. Younger people with disabilities also require continued supportive long-term-care services as they age.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> As informal caregivers and families are a vital part of the long-term-care services and support system, it is an important public purpose to recognize and respect their contributions; to assess their needs; and to provide them with counseling, education, and support services.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">Pursuant to § 42-12.3-2, it is the intent of the general assembly to create access to comprehensive health care for uninsured Rhode Islanders. The Rhode Island Medicaid program has become an important source of insurance coverage for low-income pregnant women, families with children, elders, and persons with disabilities who might not be able otherwise to obtain or afford health care. Under the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, all Americans will be required to have health insurance, with some exceptions, beginning in 2014. Federal funding is available with ACA implementation to help pay for health insurance for low-income adults, ages nineteen (19) to sixty-four (64), who do not qualify for Medicaid eligibility under Rhode Island general and public laws. It is the intent of the general assembly, therefore, to implement the Medicaid expansion for adults without dependent children authorized by the ACA, to extend health insurance coverage to these Rhode Islanders and further the goal established in § 42-12.3-2 in 1993.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>Abused or Neglected Child.</b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, in defining an abused and neglected child, and the decisions of this court applying the statute, have not required a finding of “intent.” In re Adam R., 665 A.2d 882, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 239 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Evidence supported a conclusion that the children were abused and neglected since testimony by social workers, parent aides, and a psychologist established that the mother had borderline intellectual functioning and lacked parental and management skills, that the children lived in squalid conditions, and that both the mother and children had been abused by upstairs tenants. In re Adam R., 665 A.2d 882, 1995 R.I. LEXIS 239 (R.I. 1995).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State failed to present a prima facie case of child abuse against the mother and the father where the testimony revealed only that the infant was the victim of child abuse, that the injuries were of various ages, that the older injuries were undetectable even to the eyes of trained medical professionals, and that the infant had three caretakers who could have inflicted the infant’s injuries: the mother, the father, and the daycare provider. In addition, the state’s sole witness, an expert in forensic pediatrics, testified that neither petitioners nor the daycare provider could be ruled out as the perpetrators of the abuse. In re Adner G., 925 A.2d 951, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 90 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Parents’ 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 action against state child services officers was properly dismissed on the ground of their qualified immunity because, while deprivation of the right to familial integrity implicated the Fourteenth Amendment, their removal of children from the parents’ home was reasonable; the father was indicted for child molestation and both had intimated suicide. Further, R.I. Gen. Laws § 40-11-2, the statute under which the parents’ son was removed, did not require a finding of abuse; moreover, courts had recognized that an imminent serious risk of neglect justified termination of the parental relationship. Carter v. Lindgren, 502 F.3d 26, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 21471 (1st Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Legally competent evidence supported the trial justice’s findings of neglect; when the child was placed in the temporary custody of the department, the father was unable to provide for the child because of his incarceration, and when the case was tried and a decision rendered, the father had made no arrangements for the child’s well-being and was unable himself to care for the child because of his incarceration. In re Kurt H., 152 A.3d 408, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 9 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial justice committed reversible error when the justice found that a parent abused and neglected the parent’s child, after the child suffered a fractured femur, because the evidence was not sufficient to satisfy the clear and convincing standard of R.I. R. Juv. P. 17(b). The parent testified that the parent was not present at the time of the child’s injury, without evidence to the contrary, and the medical testimony left it unclear whether the child’s injury was inflicted as a result of abuse or was merely accidental in nature. In re Adrina T., 162 A.3d 658, 2017 R.I. LEXIS 93 (R.I. 2017).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the clear and convincing standard of R.I. R. Juv. P. 17(b), the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of abuse or neglect as to the mother because it was uncontested that the father’s actions were the sole cause of injury to the child’s lip, there was no evidence in the record supporting the trial justice’s finding that the child’s injuries were not the result of a one-time episode of abuse but sustained over a period of time, and the mother called the pediatrician and took the child to the emergency room after discovering her injuries. In re Sophia M., 204 A.3d 605, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 48 (R.I. 2019).</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Any person who has reasonable cause to know or suspect that any child has been abused or neglected as defined in § 40-11-2, or has been a victim of sexual abuse by another child, shall, within twenty-four (24) hours, transfer that information to the department of children, youth and families, or its agent, which shall cause the report to be investigated immediately. As a result of those reports and referrals, protective social services shall be made available to those children in an effort to safeguard and enhance the welfare of those children and to provide a means to prevent further abuse or neglect. The department shall establish and implement a single, statewide, toll-free telephone to operate twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week for the receipt of reports concerning child abuse and neglect, which reports shall be electronically recorded and placed in the central registry established by § 42-72-7. The department shall create a sign, using a format that is clear, simple, and understandable to students, that contains the statewide, toll-free telephone number for posting in all public and private schools in languages predominately spoken in the state, containing pertinent information relating to reporting the suspicion of child abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse. This sign shall be available to the school districts electronically. The electronically recorded records, properly indexed by date and other essential, identifying data, shall be maintained for a minimum of three (3) years; provided, however, any person who has been reported for child abuse and/or neglect, and who has been determined not to have neglected and/or abused a child, shall have his or her record expunged as to that incident three (3) years after that determination. The department shall continuously maintain a management-information database that includes all of the information required to implement this section, including the number of cases reported by hospitals, healthcare centers, emergency rooms, and other appropriate healthcare facilities.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The reporting shall include immediate notification of the department of any instance where parents of an infant have requested deprivation of nutrition that is necessary to sustain life and/or who have requested deprivation of medical or surgical intervention that is necessary to remedy or ameliorate a life-threatening medical condition, if the nutrition or medical or surgical intervention is generally provided to similar nutritional, medical, or surgical conditioned infants, whether disabled or not.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prevent a child’s parents and physician from discontinuing the use of life-support systems or nonpalliative treatment for a child who is terminally ill where, in the opinion of the child’s physician exercising competent medical judgment, the child has no reasonable chance of recovery from the terminal illness despite every, appropriate medical treatment to correct the condition.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A child’s statement that her father had beaten her and threatened to kill her, reported by teachers with whom a social worker had had repeated contact in conjunction with her treatment of the child and whose veracity she had no reason to doubt, the child’s complaints during the preceding week and a half of similar beatings, the reported bruises on her body, her unusual fear of going home, and her violently disruptive and self-abusive behavior were more than sufficient to mandate a report to the Department of Children and Their Families under this section by the social worker.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a prosecution for sexual offenses, the trial court did not limit the defendant’s right to an effective cross-examination of the victim’s mother by barring inquiries as to when she first notified the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) about her daughter’s disclosure of sexual abuse and whether the mother realized she had an obligation to notify DYCF under this section.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since, in the context of a discussion about serious child abuse, the student said that she was hit and bruised, and while she was asked about being hit by her parents, she was crying, those undisputed facts alone rendered the rape crisis center employee’s suspicion that the student was being abused eminently reasonable. In fact, the employee could have been accused of breaking the law had she not reported her suspicions to the department of children and their families within 24 hours, given the content of the student’s speech.

The principal, headmaster, executive director, or other person in charge of the educational program, or his or her designated agent, shall be responsible for all subsequent notification to the department of children, youth and families, or its agent in the manner required by this section.

<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The department of children, youth and families, or its agent shall immediately forward the report to state police and local law enforcement, and shall initiate an investigation of the allegations of sexual abuse if it determines that the report meets the criteria for a child protective services investigation.

In the event the department substantiates the allegations of sexual abuse against an employee, agent, contractor, or volunteer of an educational program, the department shall immediately notify the state police; the local law enforcement agency; the department of education; the educational program; the person who is the subject of the investigation; and the parent, or parents, of the child who is alleged to be the victim of the sexual abuse of the department’s findings.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A simple investigation, without more, causes nothing but a de minimis interference with a family’s integrity, and such interference cannot possibly rise to the level of a constitutional violation. Therefore, a rape crisis center employee’s decision to call the department of children and their families to report suspected child abuse contained not one iota of constitutional misconduct.

In addition, in cases of alleged abuse and/or neglect, the department may petition the family court for the removal of the alleged perpetrator of that abuse and/or neglect from the household of the child or children when the child or children are eleven (11) years of age or older.

Such jurisdiction shall also include the power to effect or cause the return of the child or its transfer to another location and custody pursuant to law. The sending agency shall continue to have financial responsibility for support and maintenance of the child during the period of the placement.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(b)</b> When the sending agency is a public agency, it may enter into an agreement with an authorized public or private agency in the receiving state providing for the performance of one or more services in respect of such case by the latter as agent for the sending agency.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(c)</b> Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent a private charitable agency authorized to place children in the receiving state from performing services or acting as agent in that state for a private charitable agency of the sending state; nor to prevent the agency in the receiving state from discharging financial responsibility for the support and maintenance of a child who has been placed on behalf of the sending agency without relieving the responsibility set forth in paragraph (a) hereof.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The director of the department of human services, in addition to the medical assistance benefits provided in chapter 8 of this title, shall maintain and coordinate a program of long-term home health care. The purpose of the program of long-term home health care is to provide in-hospital eligible patients, who would be discharged to a skilled nursing facility and/or an intermediate-care facility, with a viable alternative to placement in a skilled nursing facility and/or intermediate-care facility. The director shall utilize a federally approved home- and community-based service waiver to provide a viable alternative. The hereinafter listed services shall be an integral part of the viable alternative.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> In addition, the director of the department of human services shall utilize any and all other available departmental resources and community resources to enhance and expand the provision of long-term home health care as the viable alternative to placement in a skilled nursing facility and/or an intermediate-care facility. These resources shall be used to strengthen and expand home- and community-based long-term-care services, which will help people stay at home for care when this is an appropriate alternative to nursing facility care.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> In furtherance of subsections (a) and (b) above, the department of human services is authorized and directed to seek any waiver(s) required by the United States Department of Health and Human Services in accordance with otherwise applicable requirements of Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act to establish an enhancement of the program for the provision of adult daycare services and home-based services. The department of human services is directed to seek the waiver(s) in order to claim federal financial participation for the services that shall be provided to residents of the state who are deemed to be in need of adult daycare services and/or home-based services and whose incomes are no greater than two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the federal poverty level.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Upon receipt of the waiver approval(s) referred to in subsection (c) above from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the department of human services shall file with the house and senate finance committees a report of the terms and conditions of these approved waiver(s) together with a detailed plan for the implementation of them within the aggregate general revenue appropriations for adult daycare and home-based services benefits and administrative costs provided for in the enacted budget for state fiscal year 2003; and, provided further, that any reallocations of these general revenue appropriations between or among departments and/or appropriation line items necessary to implement the approved waiver(s), and/or adjustments to federal revenue appropriations consistent with these waiver approval(s), shall be submitted to the general assembly by the governor in the supplemental appropriations act for state fiscal year 2003 in accordance with § 35-3-8.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> Pregnant and parenting adolescent students face more educational barriers due to student’s high absenteeism, inattentiveness in class, have increased problems of illiteracy and lack the motivation to stay in school during the pregnancy or to return to school after the infant is born.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> A prime factor in parenting students dropping out of school is the absence of child care, either in the school, community, or home.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(9)</b> The long-term cost savings are significant as comparisons are made between the cost of providing services to each pregnant and parenting adolescent as one thousand six hundred forty two dollars ($1,642) yearly with an additional cost for daycare services on site in school based programs of three thousand one hundred fifteen dollars ($3,115) yearly as compared to the cost of providing welfare, food stamps, and medical assistance to each client on a yearly basis of eight thousand four hundred dollars ($8,400).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(10)</b> The long-term cost savings is significant as adolescent mothers equipped with a high school diploma are more able to find employment, continue career options, and care for themselves and child, therefore becoming less dependent on public assistance (income maintenance) after graduation.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In the event that a real or seeming ambiguity is perceived in reading the language of a statute, the Supreme Court will attempt to ascertain the intention of a legislative body from a consideration of the entire statute, keeping in mind its nature, object, language and arrangement, and this doctrine is applicable to the ascertainment of the intent of the framers of a municipal charter. Algiere v. Fox, 122 R.I. 55, 404 A.2d 72, 1979 R.I. LEXIS 2062 (1979).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Legislative Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The savings statute, § 43-3-23, which would have operated to impose a harsher sentence under prior law, was held inapplicable since there was a manifest legislative intent to mitigate the penalty.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice did not err in determining that the preservation of abominable and detestable crime against nature charges against the defendant would have been inconsistent with the manifest intention of the legislature to decriminalize sodomy between consenting adults and that such preservation would be repugnant to the statute as amended. State v. Mullen, 740 A.2d 783, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 195 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Legislature intended the minimum-damages provision of the Wrongful Death Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-7-2, to apply on a per-claim—rather than per-defendant—basis; because application of the rule that words importing the singular number may be extended or applied to several persons or things would not lead to a construction inconsistent with the manifest intent of the General Assembly, or be repugnant to some other part of the statute, the minimum-damages provision of § 10-7-2 applies to multiple actors.

<p class="p7"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Acts which constituted rape under former § 11-37-1 could be prosecuted even though the prosecution was commenced after the repeal of that section due to the simultaneous-repeal-and-reenactment exception to the abatement doctrine. State v. Babbitt, 457 A.2d 1049, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 829 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where, in a prosecution for indecent assault pursuant to former § 11-37-6, the information was not filed until June 24, 1980, there was no prosecution pending when the legislature repealed the indecent-assault section on May 9, 1979. Therefore, the general savings clause of this section did not apply, and defendant’s conviction for indecent assault was reversed. State v. Souza, 456 A.2d 775, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 815 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Common-Law Abatement.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The common-law rule of abatement holds that in the absence of a savings provision a defendant may not be convicted under a statute that has been repealed. State v. Souza, 456 A.2d 775, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 815 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Criminal actions that have not yet commenced when the statute outlining the crime charged is repealed abated pursuant to the common-law rule and are not saved by this section. State v. Souza, 456 A.2d 775, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 815 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The simultaneous-repeal-and-reenactment exception to the abatement doctrine holds that a new act should be considered a continuation of the old in situations in which no substantial changes have been made in the legislation. Under such circumstances, there is no abatement of any of the legal consequences of acts committed under the old statute. State v. Babbitt, 457 A.2d 1049, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 829 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, by its express terms, saves prosecutions or indictments that are pending at the time of repeal of a criminal statute, thereby creating another exception to the common-law abatement doctrine.

<p class="p7"><b>Legislative Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to § 43-3-2, this section will not be applied where its application would contravene the manifest legislative intent in enacting the repealing statute. State v. Macarelli, 118 R.I. 693, 375 A.2d 944, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1509 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Penalty Provisions.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section, barring other considerations, preserves the penalty provisions of a repealed law. State v. Macarelli, 118 R.I. 693, 375 A.2d 944, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1509 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not apply to subsequent statutes mitigating the penalty for the crime charged. State v. Macarelli, 118 R.I. 693, 375 A.2d 944, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1509 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Supreme Court of Rhode Island held that the trial justice was correct in determining that the general savings clause, R.I. Gen. Laws § 43-3-23, was applicable and that the 2012 amendment to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-5 should not have been applied retroactively. State v. Whiting, 115 A.3d 956, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant’s conviction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-5 was affirmed where the 2012 amendment to the statute concerned a mere increase in the monetary threshold, the amendment was not a qualitative shift altering the fundamental essence of larceny prosecutions, and defendant’s conduct had remained illegal at all times. State v. Whiting, 115 A.3d 956, 2015 R.I. LEXIS 65 (R.I. 2015).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Savings Clauses.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where criminal statute is repealed and repealing statute contains no saving clause, this section has the effect of saving criminal proceedings pending at the time of the repeal unless such construction would be clearly repugnant to the express provisions of the repealing statute. State v. Lewis, 91 R.I. 110, 161 A.2d 209, 1960 R.I. LEXIS 63 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice did not err in determining that the preservation of abominable and detestable crime against nature charges against the defendant would have been inconsistent with the manifest intention of the legislature to decriminalize sodomy between consenting adults and that such preservation would be repugnant to the statute as amended.

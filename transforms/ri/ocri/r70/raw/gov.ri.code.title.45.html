Gen.

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> For fiscal year 2014, municipalities shall be eligible to receive aid under this chapter if: (1) the municipality has no locally-administered pension; or (2) the municipality notified plan participants, beneficiaries and others pursuant to chapter 65 of this title, and submitted to the state’s department of revenue a Funding Improvement Plan (“FIP”), pursuant to § 45-65-6, for every locally-administered pension plan in that municipality, and each FIP had been approved by the plan sponsor and the local governing body no later than June 1, 2013; or (3) there existed a locally-administered pension plan(s) in that municipality, but either: (i) no FIP was required pursuant to chapter 65 of this title; or (ii) a FIP is required pursuant to chapter 65 of this title, but, the due date for the FIP submission is after the March payment of state aid.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> For fiscal year 2015 and each fiscal year thereafter that municipal incentive aid is distributed to eligible municipalities under this chapter, municipalities shall be eligible to receive aid under this chapter, if: (1) the municipality has no locally-administered pension; or (2) the municipality has transitioned all locally-administered pension plans into MERS by June 30, 2014; or (3) the municipality had notified plan participants, beneficiaries and others pursuant to chapter 65 of this title and had submitted to the state’s department of revenue a FIP, pursuant to chapter 65 of this title, for every locally-administered pension plan and each submitted FIP meets the guidelines of the Study Commission on Locally-Administered Pension Plans created pursuant to § 45-65-8 or otherwise applicable guidelines or regulations and each FIP has been approved by the plan sponsor and the local governing body; or (4) the municipality has implemented the original recommended FIP or an amended FIP pursuant to chapter 65 of this title within one month after the close of the fiscal year and made the required funding payment (formerly referred to as Annually Required Contribution, or ARC) in compliance with the municipality’s adopted FIP(s) and the funding guidelines established by the Pension Study Commission and the FIPs are approved by the plan sponsor and the local governing body; or (5) there existed a locally-administered pension plan in that municipality, but either: (i) no FIP was required pursuant to chapter 65 of this title and either: (A) the municipality is funding one hundred percent (100%) of its required funding payment; or (B) the municipality has a funded ratio of one hundred percent (100%) or greater; or (ii) FIP is required pursuant to chapter 65 of this title, however, the due date for the FIP submission or implementation is after the March payment of this municipal incentive aid.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> For fiscal year 2014, and in any year thereafter that a municipality is not eligible to receive a distribution under this chapter, the distribution that said municipality would have received had it been eligible shall be reappropriated to the immediately following fiscal year, at which time the amount reappropriated shall be distributed to said municipality provided that said municipality has satisfied the eligibility requirements of both the prior fiscal year and the then current fiscal year. In the event that said municipality fails to satisfy the eligibility requirements for the prior and the then current fiscal year by the time that eligibility to receive distributions in the next fiscal year is determined, then the amount that would have been distributed to the municipality for said prior year will be distributed in the month of May among the municipalities that received a distribution in the prior fiscal year, with the share to be received by each municipality calculated in the same manner as distributions were calculated in the prior fiscal year.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Procedural Effect.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff ’s failure to file the presentment of claim pursuant to this section in its personal injury claim against defendant municipality did not result in the action having not been timely filed within the period of the statute of limitations since the failure to file a presentment of claim is a matter of defense. Accordingly, since the action was filed within the period limited by the applicable statute of limitation but dismissed for failure to file presentment, plaintiffs had the benefit of § 9-1-22, which would authorize them to bring another action within a year after the termination of the first action. Blessing v. South Kingstown, 626 A.2d 204, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 165 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The court properly granted the defendant-town’s motion for summary judgment on the basis that the plaintiff, who was ordered by municipal zoning officers to cease and desist the construction of an apartment, failed to comply with this section, which requires presentment of a claim for damages to the town council as a first step in obtaining redress. Almeida v. Town of Tiverton, 639 A.2d 982, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 83 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a police chief and lieutenant sued by an officer filed a defamation counterclaim against the officer based on the contents of the officer’s notice of claim presented to a town council, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-15-5, it was error to dismiss the counterclaim on the grounds that the notice was absolutely privileged because the notice was not part of a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, as (1) the notice was but a condition precedent to suing the town, and (2) the town did not act as a quasi-judicial body when receiving the notice. Ims v. Town of Portsmouth, 32 A.3d 914, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 146 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a police chief and lieutenant sued by an officer filed a defamation counterclaim against the officer based on the contents of the officer’s notice of claim presented to a town council, pursuant to R.I. Gen.

Ims v. Town of Portsmouth, 32 A.3d 914, 2011 R.I. LEXIS 146 (R.I. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Purpose of Section.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not confer any additional rights upon a person who has a claim against a town. Rather, its function simply is to require a claimant to inform the town of his claim prior to commencing an action against the town. The town council need take no action on the claim filed. Parente v. Town of West Warwick, 685 F. Supp. 873, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4172 (D.R.I. 1988), aff'd, 868 F.2d 522, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 2413 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The rationale behind the 40-day period provided for in this section is that a city or town should have a reasonable opportunity to settle a claim without putting the municipality to the expense of defending an action at law. Bernard v. Alexander, 605 A.2d 484, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 63 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Recovery of Illegal Taxes.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An action to recover taxes collected under an illegal assessment should be brought against the city treasurer in accord with this section, and not against the collector. Fish v. Higbee, 22 R.I. 223, 47 A. 212, 1900 R.I. LEXIS 81 (1900).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Settlement With Agent of Municipality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A settlement agreement entered into by a municipality’s order supply board, an agent of the municipality, releasing that agent from liability for its negligence in a tort action, simultaneously released the municipality from liability arising from the same action, despite language contained in the settlement agreement expressly preserving the plaintiff ’s right to proceed against the municipality. Hervieux v. Papineau, 611 A.2d 838, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 136 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice to town council, in case of a claim for unliquidated damages, is sufficient if it states the facts from which the claim arises although it does not state the amount of the claim. Burdick v. Richmond, 16 R.I. 502, 17 A. 917, 1889 R.I. LEXIS 41 (1889).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-15-5 was applicable, it was irrelevant since it would have been unjust to enter a judgment for the city where the city negligently and erroneously assessed taxes against the property owner. The property owner’s post-filing notice adequately afforded the city an opportunity to equitably deal with its taxpayer. United Lending Corp. v. City of Providence, 827 A.2d 626, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 179 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Tort Claims.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section was applicable to a wrongful death claim against a town based upon the alleged negligence of the town police in failing to guard against suicide by the decedent while in their custody, the immunity conferred by the courts of the state upon municipal and quasi-municipal corporations being abrogated as to claims against such corporations arising after June 30, 1970, subject to any legislation by the general assembly limiting or regulating the prosecution of such claims. Becker v. Beaudoin, 106 R.I. 562, 261 A.2d 896, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 957 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The state statutory scheme not only is designed to ensure “a minimum per pupil expenditure level” throughout the state, but also encourages school committees to provide superior education beyond this minimum and under this scheme the general revenues of the town are immunized from satisfying obligations incurred by its school committee and the statutory requirements of presentation to council of claims, including notice, are irrelevant in suit for damages for suspension from school. Panzarella v. Boyle, 406 F. Supp. 787, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14692 (D.R.I. 1975).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Town Treasurer.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a town council has voted to compromise or pay a claim, the town treasurer has a ministerial duty to pay the same. Depault v. Paine, 526 A.2d 858, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 516 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Waiver.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>City waived the defense of lack of notice of a claim as required by this section by failing to plead that defense. Mesolella v. Providence, 508 A.2d 661, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 459 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice requirements will not be waived on the basis of the municipality’s actual knowledge. Serpa v. Amaral, 635 A.2d 1196, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 15 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a trial court foreclosed a city’s rights of redemption to property it negligently permitted to be sold at a tax sale, the city’s failure to file an answer with specifications setting forth the matters upon which it relied to defeat the title was fatal to its claim, amounted to a waiver of all defenses, and was in essence a failure to respond. Thus, there was no valid offer to redeem either before or during the foreclosure proceeding. Smith v. City of Providence, 828 A.2d 536, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 184 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Building permit applicant waived any appeal of a finding that it failed to comply with R.I. Gen.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>What constituted reasonable care in the maintenance of a public bridge was a question of fact depending on the circumstances of the particular case, such as the location of the bridge and the ordinary traffic reasonably to be expected upon such bridge. Smith v. Howard, 42 R.I. 126, 105 A. 649, 1919 R.I. LEXIS 17 (1919).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It is a question of fact for a jury where there is controversial evidence as to whether or not a defect is latent or by the exercise of reasonable care and diligence could have been ascertained.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>General assembly having authorized towns to construct sidewalks adjoining state highways, in the absence of legislation, the town still has the duty to keep the sidewalks in safe condition for travel even though a state board has jurisdiction of general plan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But see Pullen v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Summary judgment for a city is affirmed in a motorist’s personal injury action where the city is alleged to have been negligent in that it allowed a stop sign at the intersection to be mutilated beyond recognition and to become obstructed from view by trees, brush, and bushes.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In situations in which two lights control the same flow of traffic, each light functions as an independent and indispensable signal.

<p class="p7"><b>Trimming Vegetation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subsections (a) and (c) (now see (f) and (i)) of § 31-1-23 in defining highway and roadway contemplate that a highway is wider than a roadway and includes the “entire width” between the boundary lines of the public way, including the sidewalk, berm, or shoulder; it therefore follows that if the vegetation obstructing the view of the motorist in the accident was located on the town’s property and within the boundary lines of the highway, then the town was under a duty to keep this portion of the highway “safe and convenient for travelers” pursuant to § 24-5-1. O'Gara v. Ferrante, 690 A.2d 1354, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 80 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The activity of trimming a shrub is one in which private persons normally engage; therefore, the town is not shielded from tort liability by the public duty doctrine if the town was negligent in maintaining the vegetation around the intersection. O'Gara v. Ferrante, 690 A.2d 1354, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 80 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was error to grant summary judgment to a town in an indemnity/contribution action stemming from an automobile accident because the trial court could not resolve the accident’s proximate cause in relation to the town’s statutory duty to trim vegetation; proximate cause was a determination reserved for the jury.

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The requirement that municipalities be notified does not violate the equal protection clause of U.S. Const., Amend. 14, since the classification of private parties and governmental entities is a reasonable one. Tessier v. Ann &amp; Hope Factory Outlet, 114 R.I. 315, 332 A.2d 781, 1975 R.I. LEXIS 1416 (1975).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Claims Not Requiring Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The notice requirement of subsection (a) did not apply to the plaintiffs in this case, since they were not the injured party but were filing and action for contribution and/or indemnification against the town. The plaintiffs properly complied with § 45-15-5. O'Gara v. Ferrante, 690 A.2d 1354, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 80 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Claims of Which Notice Required.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A claim for trespass on land by agents of a town was not required to be filed within 60 days after trespass was committed. Hathaway v. Osborne, 25 R.I. 249, 55 A. 700, 1903 R.I. LEXIS 61 (1903).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Requirement of notice did not apply to a suit by a landowner to recover damages for injury to his property as result of construction by the city of a sewer in a highway. Fugere v. Cook, 27 R.I. 134, 60 A. 1067, 1905 R.I. LEXIS 45 (1905).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Damages Claimed.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plaintiff in a personal injury action against a municipality is not limited in recovery of damages to the amount of damages named in the notice of claim. Comery v. White, 40 R.I. 21, 99 A. 756, 1917 R.I. LEXIS 7 (1917).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Effect of Failure to Give Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Failure of plaintiff to give a sufficient legal notice cannot be waived. Batchelder v. White, 28 R.I. 466, 68 A. 320, 1907 R.I. LEXIS 81 (1907).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The notice required by this section is jurisdictional and failure of plaintiff to give such notice required a dismissal of her action for want of jurisdiction. Barroso v. Pepin, 106 R.I. 502, 261 A.2d 277, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 951 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the plaintiff never filed a notice of claim against the city whom she alleged was liable for her injuries as required by this section, she could not recover against the city as a matter of law. Shola v. Refinement Int'l Co., 617 A.2d 408, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 261 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although plaintiff was alleging negligence by the city in the maintenance of the sidewalk, rather than a defect, she was still required to comply with the notice provisions of this section. This section and § 45-15-8 set forth the procedures for bringing an action against a municipality. Natareno v. Martin, 694 A.2d 749, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 167 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the notice required by this provision is a jurisdictional condition precedent to bringing suit, a plaintiff who failed to give such notice until 124 days after sustaining injuries was not entitled to dismissal without prejudice. Provost v. Finlay, 768 A.2d 1256, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 92 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The notice requirements of this provision are a condition precedent to a right of action and may not be waived. Moseley v. Fitzgerald, 773 A.2d 254, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 163 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Liberal Construction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unless the construction of this section deprives the municipality of safeguards of notice to investigate defects, the court will construe it with liberality in favor of the plaintiff. Gannon v. Fitzpatrick, 58 R.I. 147, 191 A. 489, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 15 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section should be liberally construed for plaintiff where she gives reasonable notice of the time, place and cause of the accident which does not mislead or prejudice the municipality in its investigation or defense. Malo v. McAloon, 65 R.I. 26, 13 A.2d 245, 1940 R.I. LEXIS 72 (1940).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Parking Lots.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A pedestrian injured in a fall from an elevated divider separating two portions of a parking lot cannot bring an action for negligence against the city because an elevated divider cannot be considered a sidewalk within the meaning of this section where the parking lot itself cannot be considered a roadway used for vehicular traffic. Alfano v. Landers, 585 A.2d 651, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 21 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Purpose of Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of the notice under this section is to afford the defendant an opportunity in good season to investigate the facts and to determine advisability of settling the claim. Gannon v. Fitzpatrick, 58 R.I. 147, 191 A. 489, 1937 R.I. LEXIS 15 (1937).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While the clear purpose of the statutory notice is to inform the defendant of the nature of the claim in sufficient detail to permit it to investigate the circumstances and prepare a defense against the allegations presented, it is otherwise to be construed liberally in favor of the plaintiff. Karczmarczyk v. Quinn, 98 R.I. 174, 200 A.2d 461, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 143 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The purpose of this provision is to give municipalities an opportunity to investigate claims and if appropriate to settle them without litigation. Provost v. Finlay, 768 A.2d 1256, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 92 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The notice under this section requires particularly of time, place, and cause of injury or damage in order to enable town or city council to make an independent investigation of the claim. Maloney v. Cook, 21 R.I. 471, 44 A. 692, 1899 R.I. LEXIS 105 (1899).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice which stated erroneous date was defective and action against town could not be maintained. Taylor v. Peck, 29 R.I. 481, 72 A. 645, 1909 R.I. LEXIS 47 (1909).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A notice, though called a claim, was within the meaning of this section where it set forth a claim for damages for injuries alleged to have been received on one of the highways through a defect therein, and also set forth information as to the time, place and cause of such injury. Beebe v. Greene, 34 R.I. 171, 82 A. 796, 1912 R.I. LEXIS 35 (1912).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Amended declaration charging negligence in failing to warn of hole in street was not in fatal variance with notice under this section since this section does not require notice to contain specifications of the city’s negligence or particularities of a declaration, but is sufficient if it informs the city with substantial certainty of time and place of the accident and nature of the defect so as to aid in investigation of liability. Brickle v. Quinn, 63 R.I. 120, 7 A.2d 890, 1939 R.I. LEXIS 92 (1939).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plaintiff ’s notice to the city was sufficient where it apprised it of the location, time, and cause of injury, such as to enable the city to investigate and defend against the claim. Mulvaney v. Napolitano, 639 A.2d 984, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 88 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Cause of Injury.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice of claim for injuries, the cause of which was “the defective condition of said sidewalk,” was not notice of the cause of injury but merely stated the general statutory ground of liability and gave absolutely no information as to the nature of the defect claimed. Maloney v. Cook, 21 R.I. 471, 44 A. 692, 1899 R.I. LEXIS 105 (1899).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although notice of the claim does not have to fix the exact location of a defect, as long as it locates the place in a reasonably sufficient manner, the cause of injury must be described with sufficient detail. Lahaye v. City of Providence, 640 A.2d 978, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 125 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plaintiff, who fell over a cut-off cement post protruding over a sidewalk, filed an inadequate statutory presentment, where it inaccurately described the location of the accident, a description which excluded the actual location; and claimed a “defective condition” of the sidewalk, which was not a description, but rather a mere statement of the general statutory grounds of liability. Lahaye v. City of Providence, 640 A.2d 978, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 125 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plaintiff’s description of the defect which caused her to fall as a “dangerous condition of the sidewalk which is located at the northeast corner at the intersection of South Main Street and Williams Street, Providence, Rhode Island” was sufficient to place the city on notice regarding the type of defect and, more importantly, its precise location. Marques v. Napolitano, 708 A.2d 177, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 61 (R.I.), reaff'd, 714 A.2d 1185, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 230 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Curing of Defects.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defective written notice to city council of place and cause of highway accident was not cured by statement of plaintiff’s attorney of the exact place and cause at an appearance before the committee on claims within the sixty-day period, as the giving of notice is made a condition precedent to suit against the city. Maloney v. Cook, 21 R.I. 471, 44 A. 692, 1899 R.I. LEXIS 105 (1899).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pedestrian’s motion for leave to amend her complaint to more specifically pinpoint the location of a sewer grate the pedestrian alleged was negligently maintained was properly denied as an amendment could not cure the defect in the complaint as the R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-15-9 60 day time limit for filing or amending a notice of claim to a city had expired. Prout v. City of Providence, 996 A.2d 1139, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 75 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In plaintiff’s suit against the city after tripping and falling on an oversized crack in the cement sidewalk, plaintiff’s attempt to amend her notice of claim was invalid; plaintiff did not move to amend the claim regarding the location of her injury until nearly two years after the initial notice of claim with the city council was filed, and plaintiff filed her amended complaint setting forth a revised location outside of the 60-day prescribed statutory time frame. Ahearn v. City of Providence, 181 A.3d 495, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 35 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Persons Receiving Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice to a member of the town council is not notice to the town. Whitford v. Palmer, 40 R.I. 196, 100 A. 312, 1917 R.I. LEXIS 21 (1917).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Plaintiff’s suit against a town alleging she was injured due to a defective sidewalk was properly dismissed on summary judgment; as the description provided in her notice of claim excluded the actual area where the injury occurred, the notice did not fix the location in a reasonably sufficient manner under R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-15-9. Carbone v. Ward, 56 A.3d 442, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 151 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Time and Place of Injury.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice to city council of claim for injuries sustained “while walking on the southerly side of Church Street” was insufficient as too vague and general to enable city council to determine locality of the accident with reasonable certainty, where the exact place could have been easily described. Maloney v. Cook, 21 R.I. 471, 44 A. 692, 1899 R.I. LEXIS 105 (1899).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice which fixed an impossible date for occurrence of injury was insufficient. Batchelder v. White, 28 R.I. 465, 68 A. 320, 1907 R.I. LEXIS 82 (1907).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice to a municipal corporation does not have to include an exact location of the place of injury as long as it locates the place in a reasonably sufficient manner. Comery v. White, 40 R.I. 21, 99 A. 756, 1917 R.I. LEXIS 7 (1917).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice to municipality under this section of injury on dark street from obstruction in sidewalk was sufficient to uphold jury verdict where it set out about the distance from a corner and about the location in reference to a house, even though there were two identical obstructions near location given, since municipality was not misled. Malo v. McAloon, 65 R.I. 26, 13 A.2d 245, 1940 R.I. LEXIS 72 (1940).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court properly dismissed plaintiff’s action for her failure to indicate where her sidewalk injuries occurred. Ramos v. Napolitano, 633 A.2d 1361, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 208 (R.I. 1993).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice to a city of a pedestrian’s claim for personal injuries suffered when she stepped onto a sewer grate that was negligently maintained was insufficient where it stated the location of the sewer grate as being “at or near” a street that was 1,249 feet long and had 18 sewer grids. Prout v. City of Providence, 996 A.2d 1139, 2010 R.I. LEXIS 75 (R.I. 2010).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In plaintiff’s suit against the city after tripping and falling on an oversized crack in the cement sidewalk, plaintiff failed to provide notice of the location of her injury in a reasonably sufficient manner when she directed the city to a nonexistent location; therefore, plaintiff failed to satisfy the statutory requirements necessary to maintain her action against the city and her claim had to fail. Ahearn v. City of Providence, 181 A.3d 495, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 35 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>— Waiver.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sufficient notice is a prerequisite to bringing suit against a municipality, and the requirement may not be waived voluntarily or involuntarily. Lahaye v. City of Providence, 640 A.2d 978, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 125 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the notice requirement under this provision may not be waived voluntarily or involuntarily, the defendant municipality did not waive its right to assert an untimely notice defense by waiting over three years to file its dismissal motion. Provost v. Finlay, 768 A.2d 1256, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 92 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Time of Filing Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice on March 14 concerning accident on January 13 was within 60-day requirement, since first day is excluded in determining whether notice was served within statutory limit.

Since R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-15-16 was not mandatory, the town was not responsible for paying the prejudgment interest that was awarded to the driver on the driver’s recovery against the officer.

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This chapter does not violate the equal protection clause of the federal constitution or the seventh amendment right to trial by jury. Hargreaves v. Reis, 977 F. Supp. 123, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14244 (D.R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not abrogate the rule that, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, the amount of recovery from a third person who is responsible for a person’s injury is not affected by the mere receipt by the plaintiff of wages or salary from his employer for the period of his injury or a gratuity from a collateral source independent of the defendant (collateral source rule). Aldcroft v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., 106 R.I. 311, 259 A.2d 408, 1969 R.I. LEXIS 630 (1969).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where there was an inconsistency between this section and a prior special statute, the court held that § 43-3-26 required the conflict to be resolved in favor of the special act, and ordinances enacted pursuant to it properly applied to the plaintiff. St. Germain v. Pawtucket, 119 R.I. 638, 382 A.2d 180, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 597 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section is remedial legislation that should be liberally construed. Aiudi v. Pepin, 417 A.2d 320, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1708 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Special legislation authorizing a city ordinance concerning payment of disability pay to fire fighters prevails over the general legislation of this section. Central Falls Firefighters v. Central Falls, 465 A.2d 770, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1091 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature did not intend Rhode Island state marshals to be included within the meaning of “police officer.” Terrano v. Department of Corrections, 573 A.2d 1181, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 94 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the injured party, an animal-control officer for the town, slipped and fell on the owners’ driveway after being called to their residence to remove a stray cat, the owners were not entitled to summary judgment pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 56 in the injured party’s negligence action; the public safety officer’s rule, which prevented a police officer or firefighter from suing landowners for injuries suffered while confronting the normal, foreseeable risks of their jobs, did not extend to the animal-control officer, as the animal-control officer did not receive the same compensation, training, and benefits as police and firefighters, and did not enjoy statutory protection of R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-1 and R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-28.6-1 et seq. DeLaire v. Kaskel, 842 A.2d 1052, 2004 R.I. LEXIS 19 (R.I. 2004).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Amount of Compensation.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The 1990 amendment to this section does not accord to firefighters 100% of their salaries for injuries received or sickness contracted in the performance of duties. A general statute does not repeal special legislation that authorizes or permits a municipality to establish its own pension fund. Palazzo v. DeLuca, 694 A.2d 747, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 166 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A bifurcation between the Injured on Duty statute’s salary and medical benefits pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-1 and pension benefits under the Municipal Employees Retirement System (MERS), R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-21-1 et seq., with reimbursement for the difference between a full salary and the two-thirds salary provided by MERS, is not contemplated by either statute. Elliott v. Town of Warren, 818 A.2d 652, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 47 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Discharge Due to Work-Related Injury.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A police officer who is discharged for inability to perform his duties after a work-related injury is entitled to receive the salary to which he would have been entitled had he not been so incapacitated. Brissette v. Potter, 560 A.2d 324, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 117 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Eligibility for Medical Benefits, Etc.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is no express proviso calling for forfeiture of one’s right to medical benefits in the event the officer, for some reason, has left municipal employment. Aiudi v. Pepin, 417 A.2d 320, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1708 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even if termination of employment was involuntarily procured, there is no forfeiture of the benefits called for by statutes whose purposes are similar to those that led to the enactment of this section. Aiudi v. Pepin, 417 A.2d 320, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1708 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sentence 2 of the Injured-on-duty (IOD) statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-1(a), was a gap-filling mechanism, assuring injured retirees that they would not be left without medical coverage. However, as the city provided medical coverage for retirees, there was no gap to fill and, thus, no room for the IOD statute to furnish default benefits. That the benefit provided was less than one hundred percent of medical expenses did not alter this reality. Cahoon v. Shelton, 647 F.3d 18, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 15034 (1st Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Sentence 1 of the Injured-on-duty (IOD) statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-1(a), applied only while the beneficiary remained a member of the department and was never intended to supplement retirement benefits; Sentence 2 of the IOD statute, a general provision, conflicted with R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-19, a more specific provision, which therefore acted as an exception pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 43-3-26. Cahoon v. Shelton, 647 F.3d 18, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 15034 (1st Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Eligibility for Salary Benefits.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Salary benefits become payable only if, at the time of the demand, the officer would have been eligible to receive a salary. Aiudi v. Pepin, 417 A.2d 320, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1708 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the city had opted into the Municipal Employees Retirement System, pursuant to § 45-21-4, to provide pension benefits for its municipal employees, the plaintiff, having voluntarily elected to recover his disability pension benefits from that system, may not now, nineteen years later, seek benefits pursuant to this section. Lanni v. Ferrante, 688 A.2d 865, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 36 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Arbitrator properly found that a city was obligated to provide injured on-duty benefits to a fire chief, because Rhode Island’s Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters statute, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 45, ch. 19.1, provided such benefits to firefighters who, like the chief, were diagnosed with cancer. Thus, the chief was entitled to have sick leave used during his cancer treatment restored to him pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-1. City of E. Providence v. Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters, 982 A.2d 1281, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 130 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court correctly found that an employee, who was employed as civilian lineman with a town’s fire department, was a “firefighter” and eligible to receive salary benefits under the “injured on duty” statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-1, because the definition of “firefighter” in § 45-19-1(c) included any person employed as a member of the fire department; the employee was hired by the town as a “Firefighter 3rd Class” with the fire department, appointed as a lineman in the Communications Division of the fire department, and his identification card certified him as a “member” of the fire department. McCain v. Town of N. Providence, 41 A.3d 239, 2012 R.I. LEXIS 37 (R.I. 2012).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Exclusivity of Remedy.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A police officer cannot maintain an action in tort against a municipality and his or her superior officers for injuries sustained in the course of his or her employment, since benefits under this chapter constitute the exclusive remedy of an officer injured in the line of duty. Although this chapter is not explicit on this score, sound public policy requires that this remedy be exclusive. Nothing could be more detrimental to good order and discipline than the encouragement of civil actions by police personnel against their employers and superior officers arising out of perceived shortcomings in preparing them for dangerous circumstances that they must encounter on a daily basis. Kaya v. Partington, 681 A.2d 256, 1996 R.I. LEXIS 211 (R.I. 1996).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a retired and disabled municipal police officer had received benefits pursuant to a town Municipal Employees Retirement System (MERS), pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-21-1 et seq., for a number of years, he forfeited his right to seek supplemental benefits and additional medical expense payments under the Injured on Duty statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-1; the failure of the town to have strictly followed the procedures set out in R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-21-4(a) for the enactment of the MERS plan did not render it procedurally defective and void where it was in place and followed for a number of years, all parties accepted the benefits of it, and the intention of the town by its actions in adopting the plan by the town council was clearly an acceptance. Elliott v. Town of Warren, 818 A.2d 652, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 47 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Administratrix’s state tort claims pursuant to Rhode Island’s wrongful death act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-7-1, et seq., concerning to an off-duty police officer killed by “friendly fire”, were precluded by Rhode Island’s injured-on-duty (IOD) statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-1, et seq. Kaya did not provide any persuasive indication that the Rhode Island Supreme Court would carve out an additional exception to the exclusivity rule so as to permit a non-dependent parent of an adult child from pursuing a claim pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-7-1. Young v. City of Providence, 301 F. Supp. 2d 163, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1847 (D.R.I. 2004), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 404 F.3d 4, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 5891 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a negligence suit, a trial court erred by granting summary judgment to a fire district upon concluding that injured on duty (IOD) statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-1, was plaintiff’s exclusive remedy. Section 45-19-1 was not ambiguous and clearly applied only to paid firefighters, therefore, since plaintiff was a volunteer firefighter when he was injured during a training exercise, he was not limited by the IOD as his exclusive remedy. Angell v. Union Fire Dist. of S. Kingstown, 935 A.2d 943, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 120 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a case involving a firefighter diagnosed with colon cancer, the Workers’ Compensation Court had jurisdiction to hear the firefighter’s appeal from the denial of his application for accidental disability benefits by the Retirement Board of the Municipal Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island. Lang v. Mun. Emples. Ret. Sys. of R.I., 222 A.3d 912, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 144 (R.I. 2019) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 45-19-1 and 45-21.2-9(f), when read in conjunction, demonstrate the General Assembly’s intent to cloak the Workers’ Compensation Court with jurisdiction over appeals by aggrieved parties who have applied for an accidental disability retirement allowance pursuant to the time mandate contained in R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-1(j) and were denied by the Retirement Board of the Municipal Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island. Lang v. Mun. Emples. Ret. Sys. of R.I., 222 A.3d 912, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 144 (R.I. 2019) (decided under prior law).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-30-1(a) grants the Workers’ Compensation Court (WCC) jurisdiction that may be necessary to carry out its duties under the provisions of R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-21.2-9. For the General Assembly to grant the WCC the jurisdiction necessary to carry out its duties under § 45-21.2-9, and for the court to interpret R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-21.2-9(f) as providing the WCC with no new jurisdiction under that section, would disregard all sense of legislative intent and would defeat the underlying purpose of the act. Therefore, the General Assembly intended the WCC to have jurisdiction over appeals from adverse decisions rendered by the retirement board when the application was filed pursuant to the time mandate contained in R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-1(j). Lang v. Mun. Emples. Ret. Sys. of R.I., 222 A.3d 912, 2019 R.I. LEXIS 144 (R.I. 2019) (decided under prior law).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions of the special enabling legislation of P.L. 1925, ch. 702, allowing the city of Central Falls to establish a pension fund for its police officers and firemen, prevail over the general legislation of this section. Trembley v. Central Falls, 480 A.2d 1359, 1984 R.I. LEXIS 573 (R.I. 1984).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A collective bargaining agreement between the International Brotherhood of Police Officers and the town allowing 100% payment of disability benefits governs over P.L. 1972, ch. 272, a specific legislative act that limited disability benefits for that town’s officers to 30%. Chester v. aRusso, 667 A.2d 519 (R.I. 1995), overruled in part on other grounds, Webster v. Perotta, 774 A.2d 68 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the special legislation (P.L. 1956, ch. 3698) did not mention the method or mode by which a pension plan could be created by the town of West Warrick, the plan was not invalid merely because it was originally created by resolution rather than by ordinance. O'Connell v. Bruce, 710 A.2d 674, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 160 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Prejudgment Interest.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial court did not err in denying prejudgment interest to former police officers, since the compensation of police officers pursuant to this provision is a governmental, not a proprietary or enterprise, function.

<p class="p7"><b>Surviving Spouse.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the injured on duty (IOD) statutory remedy for a surviving spouse is so meager that it can be regarded only as a token amount, and not as compensation for the pecuniary loss for which the legislature intended to compensate a surviving spouse under the workers’ compensation statute, an intent by the legislature to make the IOD benefit exclusive in the absence of a specific provision declarative of such intent cannot be inferred. Hargreaves v. Jack, 750 A.2d 430, 2000 R.I. LEXIS 111 (R.I. 2000).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions for a surviving spouse under the injured on duty statute (IOD) do not come close to providing the same comprehensive remedy for loss that the wrongful death statute does, since the latter statute was designed to remedy the pecuniary loss and the loss of consortium suffered by the surviving spouse, while the intent behind the IOD was to provide greater benefits to certain public employees injured on the job.

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Provision in this section for a trial de novo in superior court upon appeal by a police officer of a personnel board decision is not a violation of the separation of powers doctrine set forth in R.I. Const., art. III, since the legislature has power to prescribe the mode of appeal from administrative proceedings which are judicial or quasi-judicial in nature. Weeks v. Personnel Bd. of Review, 118 R.I. 243, 373 A.2d 176, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1452 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Probationary Police Officer.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A probationary police officer did not become a regular member of the police force and entitled to a hearing upon dismissal by reason of the fact that he was employed beyond the one-year probation period without affirmative action by either the town council or the chief of police to confer upon him status as a regular member of the police force. Southland v. Town Council of S. Kingstown, 108 R.I. 738, 279 A.2d 441, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1334 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Review.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although policeman suspended from force for wearing moustache contrary to provisions of an administrative regulation has an adequate remedy at law by appealing under this section, he is not required to exhaust this remedy before bringing action in federal court under U.S.C. tit. 28, §§ 1331, 2201, 2202 and tit. 42, § 1983 on ground such suspension is in derogation of his civil rights. Potter v. McQueeney, 338 F. Supp. 1133, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14926 (D.R.I. 1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since this section does not provide any method for appellate review of actions taken in the superior court, there is no further right of appeal to the supreme court. Kurbiec v. Bastien, 120 R.I. 111, 385 A.2d 667, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 641 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although there is no right of appeal to the supreme court under this section, under R.I. Const., Amend. 12 (now see Art. X, sec. 2), the supreme court can exercise final revisory and appellate jurisdiction pursuant to its powers to issue prerogative writs, such as certiorari. Kurbiec v. Bastien, 120 R.I. 111, 385 A.2d 667, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 641 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The only review of a judgment by superior court under this section is by common-law certiorari and not by appeal. Kurbiec v. Bastien, 428 A.2d 303, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1100 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section clearly contemplates that the superior court will render a final decision in respect to the disciplining of a policeman which decision will terminate the proceedings. Kurbiec v. Bastien, 428 A.2d 303, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1100 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a de novo hearing under this section, the superior court is not constricted by the doctrines of appellate review but may substitute its judgment for that of the municipal board. This does not mean that the superior court could not act upon a stipulated set of facts. Kurbiec v. Bastien, 428 A.2d 303, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1100 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not provide for a remand to the municipal board. Kurbiec v. Bastien, 428 A.2d 303, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1100 (R.I. 1981).</p>

<p class="p6">It is the express intention of the legislature by the passage of this chapter to provide an actuarially financed retirement system for municipal employees, properly integrated with the federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., to the end that adequate benefits may be established for the employees of any municipality who become superannuated or otherwise incapacitated while in service, and whereby the employees may be assisted in accumulating reserves for themselves and their dependents to satisfactorily meet the conditions incident to old age, death, disability, and termination of the employees, in the interest of maintaining and promoting efficiency and economy in the administration of government.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The drastic pension reductions experienced by the Central Falls retirees provided a harsh example of the risks of unfunded-pension liabilities, which, in turn, provided the primary incentive toward successful pension negotiations with other municipal, police, and fire retirees, saving the state more than sixty million dollars ($60,000,000).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> If said appropriation is not made prior to July 1, 2016, the Central Falls retirees, many of whom sustained serious and permanent injuries in service to the city, will have their pensions reduced yet again, in some instances to less than sixty percent (60%) of the pension they were receiving on July 11, 2011.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> It is fair and just that the state appropriate sufficient funds to the city to supplement the city’s funding of the pension benefits to the Central Falls retirees to ensure that the Central Falls retirees continue to receive no less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the base pension benefit, after taking into account all applicable cost-of-living adjustments, for their lifetime, and to the extent applicable, for the life of their beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> <b>Appropriation payment.</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> <b>Appropriation payment and restrictions on use.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In accordance with the terms set forth in Article 22 and the settlement agreement, the state shall annually appropriate sufficient funds to the restricted account for the city of Central Falls to supplement the city’s funding for payments to Central Falls retirees in order that they continue to receive no less than seventy-five percent (75%) of their base pension benefit as of July 31, 2011, after taking into account all applicable cost-of-living adjustments, for their lifetime, and to the extent applicable, for the life of their beneficiaries. Such appropriation shall be determined annually by an actuarial valuation (“appropriation amount”), and it is expected over the life of the existing retirees to total four million eight hundred seventeen thousand seven hundred eight dollars ($4,817,708).</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> <b>Deposit of appropriation payment and payments to Central Falls retirees.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The appropriation payment shall be immediately deposited by the city into the previously established “participating retirees restricted five-year (5) account,” which shall be redesignated as the “participating retirees’ restricted account.” The participating retirees’ account shall be administered by the city and not by any third-party pension-fund manager.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Any and all withdrawals, transfers, and payments from the participating retirees’ account shall be made as set forth in the settlement agreement and accompanying appendices and said Article 22 (c) until the payments are made on July 1, 2015.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Beginning on or within thirty (30) days of July 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, with payments to be paid each retiree or beneficiary as applicable on or within thirty (30) days of July 1 of each year they are eligible for benefits under the Central Falls pension plan, the city shall distribute to each participating retiree or beneficiary the annual amount listed on the actuarial spreadsheets prepared by Sherman Actuarial Services, which shall supplement the pension payments paid by the city in order that each retiree will receive no less than seventy-five percent (75%) of his or her base pension benefit, after taking into account all applicable cost-of-living adjustments, for his or her lifetime, and to the extent applicable, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of the base pension benefit, after taking into account all applicable cost-of-living adjustments, to his or her beneficiaries for his or her lifetime. Such supplemental distributions shall be made by the city when the funds appropriated by the state are made available to the city, which shall be as close to July 1 as practicable.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> <b>Relationship to base pension payments.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The supplemental payments to the Central Falls retirees from the participating retirees’ restricted account shall not be included in the calculation of base pension benefits for the purposes of determining a retiree’s or beneficiary’s cost-of-living adjustment.</p>

The balance of monies in the participating retirees’ restricted account shall be distributed in accordance with this Article, in the amounts and to those retirees and beneficiaries listed on the actuarial spreadsheets prepared by Sherman Actuarial Services, LLC and maintained and administered by the city. The amounts set forth on the actuarial spreadsheets will supplement the pension payments being made by the city in order that each retiree will receive no less than seventy-five percent (75%) of their base pension benefit, after taking into account all applicable cost-of-living adjustments, for his or her lifetime, and to the extent applicable, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of the base pension benefit, after taking into account all applicable cost-of-living adjustments, to their beneficiaries for his or her lifetime.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Any monies remaining in the participating retirees’ restricted account after the last-living retiree attains seventy-five percent (75%) of the base pension benefit, after taking into account all applicable cost-of-living adjustments, or last-living beneficiary attains sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of the base pension benefit, after taking into account all applicable cost-of-living adjustments, shall be returned to the state under state law.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> <b>Access to account information and records.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The city shall maintain appropriate account information and records relating to all receipts into, maintenance of, and distributions from, the participating retirees’ restricted account, and shall allow, at all reasonable times, for the full inspection and copying and sharing of information about such account and any and all payments therefrom with any participating retiree and the state.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Any member in active service, regardless of length of service, is entitled to an accidental disability retirement allowance. Application for the allowance is made by the member or on the member’s behalf, stating that the member is physically or mentally incapacitated for further service as the result of an injury or illness sustained while in the performance of duty and certifying to the time, place, and conditions of the duty performed by the member that resulted in the alleged disability and that the alleged disability was not the result of the willful negligence or misconduct on the part of the member, and was not the result of age or length of service. The application shall be made within eighteen (18) months of the alleged accident from which the injury has resulted in the member’s present disability and shall be accompanied by an accident report and a physician’s report certifying to the disability. If the member was able to return to his or her employment and subsequently reinjures or aggravates the same injury or illness, the member shall make another application within eighteen (18) months of the reinjury or aggravation that shall be accompanied by a physician’s report certifying to the reinjury or aggravation causing the disability. If a medical examination made by three (3) physicians engaged by the retirement board, and other investigations as the board may make, confirms the statements made by the member, the board may grant the member an accidental disability retirement allowance.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> For the purposes of subsection (a), “aggravation” shall mean an intervening work-related trauma that independently contributes to a member’s original injury or illness that amounts to more than the natural progression of the preexisting disease or condition and is not the result of age or length of service. The intervening independent trauma causing the aggravation must be an identifiable event or series of work-related events that are the proximate cause of the member’s present condition of disability.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> “Occupational cancer,” as used in this section, means a cancer arising out of employment as a firefighter, due to injury or illness due to exposures to smoke, fumes, or carcinogenic, poisonous, toxic, or chemical substances while in the performance of active duty in the fire department.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> For purposes of subsection (a), “reinjury” shall mean a recurrence of the original work-related injury or illness from a specific ascertainable event. The specific event must be the proximate cause of the member’s present condition of disability.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Any firefighter, including one employed by the state, or a municipal firefighter employed by a municipality that participates in the optional retirement for police officers and firefighters as provided in this chapter, who is unable to perform his or her duties in the fire department by reason of a disabling occupational cancer (as defined in §§ 45-19.1-2 and 45-19.1-4) that develops or manifests itself during a period while the firefighter is in the service of the department, and any retired member of the fire force of any city or town who develops occupational cancer (as defined in §§ 45-19.1-2 and 45-19.1-4), is entitled to receive an occupational cancer disability and he or she is entitled to all of the benefits provided for in this chapter, chapters 19, 19.1, and 21 of this title and chapter 10 of title 36 if the firefighter is employed by the state.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> In the event that any party is aggrieved by the determination of the retirement board pursuant to § 45-19-1, for an injury or illness occurring on or after July 1, 2011, the party may submit an appeal to the Rhode Island workers’ compensation court. The appellant shall file a notice of appeal with the retirement board and with the workers’ compensation court within twenty (20) days of the entry of the retirement board’s decision and shall serve a copy of the notice of appeal upon the opposing party.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> Within twenty (20) days of the receipt of the notice of appeal, the retirement board shall transmit the entire record of proceedings before it, together with its order, to the workers’ compensation court.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> In the event that a party files a notice of appeal to the workers’ compensation court, the order of the retirement board shall be stayed pending further action by the court pursuant to the provisions of § 28-35-20.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the court shall assign the matter to a judge and shall issue a notice at the time advising the parties of the judge to whom the case has been assigned and the date for pretrial conference in accordance with § 28-35-20.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(j)</b> All proceedings filed with the workers’ compensation court pursuant to this section shall be de novo and shall be subject to the provisions of chapters 29 — 38 of title 28 for all case management procedures and dispute resolution processes, as provided under the rules of the workers’ compensation court. The workers’ compensation court shall enter a pretrial order in accordance with § 28-35-20(c) that grants or denies, in whole or in part, the relief sought by the petitioner. The pretrial order shall be effective upon entry and any payments ordered by it shall be paid within fourteen (14) days of the entry of the order. Provided, however, that in the event that the retirement board files a claim for trial of the pretrial order entered by the court, the order of the court shall be stayed until a final order or decree is entered by the court. If after trial and the entry of a final decree the court sustains the findings and orders entered in the pretrial order, the retirement board shall reimburse the municipality all benefits paid by it from the time the pretrial order was entered until the time the final decree is entered by the court. Where the matter has been heard and decided by the workers’ compensation court, the court shall retain jurisdiction to review any prior orders or decrees entered by it. The petitions to review shall be filed directly with the workers’ compensation court and shall be subject to the case management and dispute resolution procedures set forth in chapters 29 — 38 of title 28 (“Labor and Labor Relations”).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Based on the purpose of the statute, to provide a pension to a police officer or firefighter who is disabled and cannot work, the most plausible interpretation of this ambiguous statutory scheme is that the General Assembly intended for an accidental disability pension under R.I.

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> All impact fees imposed pursuant to the authority granted in this chapter shall be assessed upon the issuance of a building permit or other appropriate permission to proceed with development and shall be collected only upon the issuance of the certificate of occupancy or other final action authorizing the intended use of a structure.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> A governmental entity may recoup costs of excess capacity in existing capital facilities, where the excess capacity has been provided in anticipation of the needs of new development, by requiring impact fees for that portion of the facilities constructed for future users. The need to recoup costs for excess capacity must have been documented by a preconstruction assessment that demonstrated the need for the excess capacity. Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent a municipality from continuing to assess an impact fee that recoups costs for excess capacity in an existing facility without the preconstruction assessment so long as the impact fee was enacted at least ninety (90) days prior to July 22, 2000, and is in compliance with this chapter in all other respects pursuant to § 45-22.4-7. The fees imposed to recoup the costs to provide the excess capacity must be based on the governmental entity’s actual cost of acquiring, constructing, or upgrading the facility and must be no more than a proportionate share of the costs to provide the excess capacity. That portion of an impact fee deemed recoupment is exempted from provisions of subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The general assembly further finds that:</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The character of land development and subdivision, and the related public and private services, have changed substantially in recent years;</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> At present the cities and town throughout the state each establish their own procedures for review, approval, recording, and enforcement of land development and subdivision projects;</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the planning board made its approval of a plat contingent upon the dedication of a fifty-foot strip connecting the subdivision with a highway and the subdivider owned no such strip but negotiated for such a strip with owners of land between the subdivision and the highway, he should have acquired title to such strip and made it a part of the subdivision or the owners of the strip should have been required to file their dedication in the land records or convey the strip to the town before final approval of the plat. Jeffrey v. Platting Bd. of Review, 103 R.I. 578, 239 A.2d 731, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 833 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The planning commission created by a town or city under former § 45-23-2 did not have power to require subdividers to donate a minimum percentage of the ground platted for recreational purposes. Frank Ansuini, Inc. v. Cranston, 107 R.I. 63, 264 A.2d 910, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 738 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Authority.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Property owners’ lot was properly found to be an illegal nonconforming lot under South Kingstown, R.I., Subdivision Regs. § II(O) as the town planning board had the authority to enact the regulation as to lot size under former R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-23-2, and the more restrictive standard under § II(O), which did not include wetlands, applied based on South Kingstown, R.I., Zoning Ordinances § 1904. Murphy v. Zoning Bd. of Review of S. Kingstown, 959 A.2d 535, 2008 R.I. LEXIS 106 (R.I. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Initiative and Referendum.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An initiative and referendum provision of a town’s charter would not be competent to authorize the procedure to be used to adopt or to amend either a regulation for the subdivision of land or an ordinance regulating zoning in the town. The requirement of a meaningful public hearing and the rights of land owners that underlie the requirement cannot be compatible with an ordinance adopted by an initiative or referendum. L.A. Ray Realty v. Town Council of Cumberland, 603 A.2d 311, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 23 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the thrust of this chapter is to oversee and regulate new developments, it has no bearing on sales of existing houses on existing streets, and therefore the planning board is without jurisdiction to approve or disapprove such sales. Taylor v. Marshall, 119 R.I. 171, 376 A.2d 712, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1876 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subdivision regulations promulgated by a local planning commission were inapplicable to property containing former 32 unit military personnel housing exempted from zoning code as nonconforming use purchased by developer from government where developer merely sought to sell individual units and not develop land previously developed by government.

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subdivision of Existing Lot.</p>
<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A provision governing a division and subdivision of land may not be incorporated in a zoning ordinance adopted under the provisions of former § 45-24-1 et seq. Kane v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 97 R.I. 152, 196 A.2d 421, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 56 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A planning board does not have jurisdiction, under former § 45-23-1, to approve the division of a lot into two lots when such division does not require provision for a street. Slawson v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 100 R.I. 485, 217 A.2d 92, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 465 (1966).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The board has jurisdiction over sales of real estate only if the sale constitutes a subdivision within the meaning of former § 45-23-1, and thus, if there is an existing street, the board has no jurisdiction over the matter. Taylor v. Marshall, 119 R.I. 171, 376 A.2d 712, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1876 (1977); Weaver v. United Congregational Church, 120 R.I. 419, 388 A.2d 11, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 682 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Merging of Substandard Lots.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Merger provision in a town zoning ordinance, requiring the combination of substandard lots, does not create a new subdivision, and owners who are denied permits to build residences on such lots are required to pursue applications for a variance or an exception. McKendall v. Barrington, 571 A.2d 565, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 54 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Street.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former § 45-23-1’s definition of street, which was broadly drawn to include lanes, alleys and other ways, acted as a grandfather clause to exempt sales of existing homes on existing streets or ways from the provisions of this chapter. Taylor v. Marshall, 119 R.I. 171, 376 A.2d 712, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1876 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>United States Route 1 is an “existing street” as defined by former § 45-23-1. Charlestown v. Falcone, 560 A.2d 347, 1989 R.I. LEXIS 120 (R.I. 1989).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Subdivision of Existing Lot.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the plaintiffs appealed a local planning board’s denial of their application to create by subdivision a second building lot from an existing lot, the trial justice erred in characterizing the plaintiffs’ application as a variance from a frontage requirement or deviation, requiring the plaintiffs only to demonstrate an adverse impact amounting to more than a mere inconvenience, because the trial justice’s decision, in effect, accords zoning-restriction relief to a subdivision of land contrary to existing case law. Sawyer v. Cozzolino, 595 A.2d 242, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 146 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Conveyance of additional strip did not create two or more lots, tracts, or parcels of land and therefore did not constitute a subdivision. Sako v. Delsesto, 688 A.2d 1296, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 74 (R.I. 1997).</p>

Gen. Laws § 45-23-40(f) was for failure to act, the board’s oral vote to deny the application was sufficient compliance with the statutory directive and furthered the legislative intent under R.I.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The approval of a plat constituted acceptance of the streets contained therein and, upon the replatting of the subdivision to increase the frontage of lots on said streets without changing the location or width of the streets, the platter was not required to comply with an ordinance passed subsequent to the filing of the original plat and before the acceptance of the replat requiring all roads in a plat to be subgraded.

<p class="p7"><b>Intent to Dedicate.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a developer conveyed a road and open-space area in a subdivision to a nonexistent homeowners association and, although the plat was approved, there was no intent to dedicate the open-space land for public use, pursuant to this section, the owners’ failure to legally establish the association did not change the essential fact that the owners of the lots in the subdivision were the intended owners of the open-space land, and were therefore liable for taxes on the land. Wallis v. Mainville, 639 A.2d 61, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 97 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If land on an approved subdivision map is not clearly marked as a road or street, an individual claiming that the road or street is public must demonstrate that the land was dedicated by its owner as a street or a road and the public has accepted the dedication. Donnelly v. Cowsill, 716 A.2d 742, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 277 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Subdivision plat which marked private lanes “way” and “lane” did not demonstrate an intent to dedicate the lanes as public roads and the planning commission’s acceptance of the plat did not constitute a dedication to the public. Donnelly v. Cowsill, 716 A.2d 742, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 277 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Proof of Public Ownership.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plaintiff failed to meet his burden of proving the control or ownership of a parcel of land, where he rested on a mere conclusion and a legal opinion of an attorney that because the parcel was not owned by an individual, it was a public right of way owned by the town and dedicated as an official plat. Senn v. MacDougall, 639 A.2d 494, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 101 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In order for streets and roads on a subdivision map approved by the plan commission to be considered public roads, the land must be clearly marked as a road or a street on the map.

<p class="p7"><b>Waiver of Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although a developer claimed that there was no prior notice that a public water condition would be added to a subdivision approval, the trial court’s finding that the developer waived his right to challenge the sufficiency vel non of notice on constitutional and statutory grounds and pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-46-6(b) was proper; the developer waived whatever preexisting procedural and statutory rights were his with respect to the meeting when he took the action of telling his attorney that he had, in the words of the trial court, agreed to add the condition of public water.

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Minor changes, as defined in the local regulations, to a land development or subdivision plan may be approved administratively, by the administrative officer, whereupon a permit may be issued. The changes may be authorized without additional public hearings, at the discretion of the administrative officer. All changes shall be made part of the permanent record of the project application. This provision does not prohibit the administrative officer from requesting a recommendation from either the technical review committee or the planning board.

<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Major changes, as defined in the local regulations, to a land development or subdivision plan may be approved, only by the planning board and must follow the same review and public hearing process required for approval of preliminary plans as described in § 45-23-41.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Aggrieved Persons.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Nearby property owners objecting to a proposed plat did not have the status of aggrieved persons entitling them to appeal from a decision of the board of review approving the plat when they failed to show that the value or use of their property would be adversely affected by the proposed plat. Paterson v. Corcoran, 100 R.I. 475, 217 A.2d 88, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 463 (1966).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A property owner qualifying within the restrictive language of former § 45-23-20 and establishing that the use or value of his property might be affected by a proposed subdivision is entitled to judicial review without first showing that the use or value of his property will in fact be adversely affected. Jeffrey v. Platting Bd. of Review, 103 R.I. 578, 239 A.2d 731, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 833 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Property owners living within 1000 feet of a proposed subdivision which, they alleged, was not provided with adequate drainage and would damage their own land with surface water runoffs were aggrieved persons under former § 45-23-20. E. Grossman &amp; Sons v. Rocha, 118 R.I. 276, 373 A.2d 496, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1456 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Applicability of Civil Rules of Procedure.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In an appeal from a decision of the town planning board of appeal to the superior court, Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. Rules 15 and 21 were applicable to a determination whether the plaintiff’s motion to amend his pleading to add required parties should be granted. Carbone v. Planning Bd. of Appeal, 702 A.2d 386, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 302 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If an appeal from a local planning board violates the conditions of Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. Rule 11, the court may apply sanctions under that rule. Carbone v. Planning Bd. of Appeal, 702 A.2d 386, 1997 R.I. LEXIS 302 (R.I. 1997).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Nature of Review.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature did not intend to provide for de novo review in the superior court; thus the scope of judicial review is limited to a search of the record to determine if there is any competent evidence upon which the decision of the board of review or planning board rests. E. Grossman &amp; Sons v. Rocha, 118 R.I. 276, 373 A.2d 496, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1456 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Superior court reversal of board of review rejection of subdivision proposal was improper, where both sides presented evidence on the question of adequate drainage, and the credibility of the competing testimony was a matter to be determined at the administrative level. E. Grossman &amp; Sons v. Rocha, 118 R.I. 276, 373 A.2d 496, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1456 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court’s decision to allow subdivision to stand was affirmed since the record contained substantial evidence to indicate that the platting board of review’s decision comported with the requirements of this chapter. Lett v. Caromile, 510 A.2d 958, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 492 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not require that a trial justice identify and cite all competent evidence in the record upon which a decision is based, nor does it limit “competent evidence” to evidence that establishes unequivocally that a proposed development will have deleterious effects on the surrounding area. Restivo v. Lynch, 707 A.2d 663, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 20 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Scope of Review.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Judicial review of the decision of a zoning board of review is confined to a search of the record to ascertain whether the decision rests upon competent evidence or is affected by an error of law. Munroe v. Town of E. Greenwich, 733 A.2d 703, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 139 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Supreme Court Review.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the enabling legislation concerning the subdivision of land, G.L. 1956 chapter 23 of title 45, does provide for appeal to the Superior Court from planning-board decisions, there is no statutory right of appeal to the Supreme Court. Because of the absence of a statutory provision for review by the Supreme Court of the Superior Court’s judgments in subdivision cases, such judgments are only reviewable in the Supreme Court by common law certiorari. Kirby v. Planning Bd. of Review, 634 A.2d 285, 1993 R.I. LEXIS 234 (R.I. 1993).</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury.

If the enactment or amendment is not consistent, then the court shall invalidate the enactment or the amendment, or those parts of the enactment or amendment which are not consistent. The court shall not revise the local regulations to be consistent, but may suggest appropriate language as part of the court decision.</p>

A public hearing in relation to the map shall precede the adoption, at which parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. At least ten (10) days’ notice of a public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or town. Before adoption of the ordinance, the city or town council shall refer the matter to the plan commission for a report on the map, but if the plan commission does not make its report within forty-five (45) days of the reference, the necessity for the report may be deemed to be waived. The city or town council shall certify the fact of the establishment of an official map to the city or town recorder.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former Statute did not constitute an undue extension of the police power as to violate the U.S. Const., Amend. XIV or R.I. Const., Art. I, § 16. City of Providence v. Stephens, 47 R.I. 387, 133 A. 614, 1926 R.I. LEXIS 63 (1926).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Zoning statute distinguished from Hazardous-Waste-Management Act. See Gryguc v. Bendick, 510 A.2d 937, 1986 R.I. LEXIS 487 (R.I. 1986).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Amendment or Repeal of Ordinance.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If an original ordinance is void the amendment thereto is likewise void unless it can be said to be complete and perfect in and of itself. Commerce Oil Refining Corp. v. Miner, 170 F. Supp. 396, 1959 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3728 (D.R.I. 1959), set aside, 281 F.2d 465, 1960 U.S. App. LEXIS 4244 (1st Cir. 1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Local legislatures have no authority to enact zoning regulations or to amend existing zoning regulations other than that conferred upon it in the pertinent provisions of the enabling legislation. Cianciarulo v. Tarro, 92 R.I. 352, 168 A.2d 719, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 40 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A zoning ordinance amendment that reclassified a lot from residential to limited business-multifamily repealed the original ordinance to the extent that it conflicted with the amendment. Camara v. City of Warwick, 116 R.I. 395, 358 A.2d 23, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1287 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Judicial Notice of Ordinances.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The supreme court might well take judicial notice that many municipalities of this state have enacted zoning ordinances pursuant to the authority of the enabling act, chapter 24 of title 45, but it will not invoke the doctrine of judicial notice for the purpose of establishing the enactment of a municipal ordinance containing a provision repealing some prior municipal ordinance. Lincoln v. Cournoyer, 95 R.I. 280, 186 A.2d 728, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 162 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Merging of Substandard Lots.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Merger provision in a town zoning ordinance, requiring the combination of substandard lots, does not create a new subdivision, and owners who are denied permits to build residences on such lots are required to pursue applications for a variance or an exception. McKendall v. Barrington, 571 A.2d 565, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 54 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Preemption.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Land development constitutes a valid exercise of police power, and is a matter of statewide concern, preempting charter provisions or pre-existing special statutes on the same subject. Munroe v. Town of E. Greenwich, 733 A.2d 703, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 139 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Special Zoning Enabling Acts.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An inadvertent reference to this chapter by the drafter in an act enabling earth-removal ordinances was deemed to refer to the special zoning enabling act under which a town’s general zoning ordinance was passed, so that a statute which allowed the town to regulate all facets of an earth-removal operation did not supersede a zoning ordinance specifying the uses to which land in various zoning districts can be devoted. Kingsley v. Miller, 120 R.I. 372, 388 A.2d 357, 1978 R.I. LEXIS 689 (1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Validity of Ordinances.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Const., Art. I, § 10, does not apply to a proceeding attacking the validity of a zoning ordinance but only to persons accused of crimes. City of Providence v. Stephens, 47 R.I. 387, 133 A. 614, 1926 R.I. LEXIS 63 (1926).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A petitioner seeking to conduct the business of selling automobiles in a general business district cannot attack the validity of the zoning ordinance on which he relied when he filed his application for an exception or a variance by alleging the city council had no power to prohibit such business. Madden v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 89 R.I. 131, 151 A.2d 681, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 60 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since compliance by a party with a local building ordinance would not afford that party a defense if that party’s use of his property constituted a nuisance, there is no need for a court to pass on the validity of such ordinances. Commerce Oil Refining Corp. v. Miner, 281 F.2d 465, 1960 U.S. App. LEXIS 4244 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 910, 81 S. Ct. 274, 5 L. Ed. 2d 225, 1960 U.S. LEXIS 107 (1960).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A town council is not authorized to incorporate in a zoning ordinance any provision governing the division and subdivision of land. Kane v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 97 R.I. 152, 196 A.2d 421, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 56 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Zoning ordinance merger provision, by which contiguous lots are merged to form individual lots under single ownership, has a valid purpose, since it operates to decrease congestion in the streets and to prevent the overcrowding of land by limiting the number of new dwellings. Brum v. Conley, 572 A.2d 1332, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 76 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court clearly erred by finding that alterations to a hotel were not permissible under R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-40(c), and the trial justice exceeded her authority under R.I. Gen. Law § 45-24-69(d) by misconstruing a city ordinance concerning alterations to nonconforming uses, as the ordinance did not prohibit alterations without a variance and the hotel’s improvements relating to the decking, stairs, parking area, and courtyards did not expand or change the use, or otherwise violate the ordinance.

Cianciarulo v. Tarro, 92 R.I. 352, 168 A.2d 719, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 40 (1961); Camara v. City of Warwick, 116 R.I. 395, 358 A.2d 23, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1287 (1976); Mesolella v. Providence, 439 A.2d 1370, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 797 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The reason for the statutory requirement of a “comprehensive plan” is to avoid an arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious exercise of the zoning power, resulting in haphazard or piecemeal zoning. Cianciarulo v. Tarro, 92 R.I. 352, 168 A.2d 719, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 40 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The phrase “comprehensive plan” was not intended to preclude change and preserve inviolate use districts established in an original zoning ordinance, but it contemplates revision and change in the regulations to whatever extent that may be accomplished by a valid exercise of the police power delegated to the local legislature. Hadley v. Harold Realty Co., 97 R.I. 403, 198 A.2d 149, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 99 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When a relatively small area is rezoned for multi-family dwellings and that small area remains completely surrounded, with the exception of the eastern boundary, by predominately one-family homes in an A zone (one-family dwellings), the city council has not acted in accordance with the comprehensive plan as required by this section. Toole v. May-Day Realty Corp., 101 R.I. 379, 223 A.2d 545, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 402 (1966).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was in accordance with a comprehensive plan to zone for commercial use a parcel of four lots which adjoined a residential area on one side when all other property on both sides of the highway on which the parcel was located as far as the eye could see in either direction was devoted to commercial use. Willey v. Town Council of Barrington, 106 R.I. 544, 261 A.2d 627, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 956 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although it was contemplated in zoning land as residential that certain nonconforming tracts within the zone would be rezoned “Business D” on request of the owners, the rezoning of a tract as “Business D” on condition that, if not used for an automobile sales agency, it would be rezoned residential did not conform to a comprehensive plan. Oury v. Greany, 107 R.I. 427, 267 A.2d 700, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 790 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The phrase “comprehensive plan” was intended by the General Assembly to require that zoning power be exercised in accordance with police power and that every rule-making act bear a rational relationship to public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. Johnson &amp; Wales College v. DiPrete, 448 A.2d 1271, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 996 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Initiative and Referendum.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An initiative and referendum provision of a town’s charter would not be competent to authorize the procedure to be used to adopt or to amend either a regulation for the subdivision of land or an ordinance regulating zoning in the town. The requirement of a meaningful public hearing and the rights of land owners that underlie the requirement cannot be compatible with an ordinance adopted by an initiative or referendum. L.A. Ray Realty v. Town Council of Cumberland, 603 A.2d 311, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 23 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Jurisdiction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The granting of authority to municipal governments in the zoning or planning and land use statutes fails to rise to the level of an express statement that municipalities have been granted the power to regulate the tidal waters to which the state holds title. Town of Warren v. Thornton-Whitehouse, 740 A.2d 1255, 1999 R.I. LEXIS 196 (R.I. 1999).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Spot Zoning.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The validity of spot zoning in a particular case depends upon whether the zoning authority operated within the limitations prescribed by the enabling act. D'Angelo v. Knights of Columbus Bldg. Ass'n, 89 R.I. 76, 151 A.2d 495, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 59 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Spot zoning” is a term normally applied to changes in the zoning classification of a relatively small tract of land, making its use incompatible with the rest of the district. Verdecchia v. Johnston Town Council, 589 A.2d 830, 1991 R.I. LEXIS 64 (R.I. 1991).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Validity.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since amendment of a zoning ordinance is a legislative act, there is an initial presumption that it is valid. Camara v. City of Warwick, 116 R.I. 395, 358 A.2d 23, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1287 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the facts and circumstances of the individual case do not raise inferences of illegal spot zoning, the presumption of validity of the town council’s action in amending the zoning ordinance includes the presumption that the amendment was in accordance with the comprehensive plan. Sweetman v. Town of Cumberland, 117 R.I. 134, 364 A.2d 1277, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1608 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A plaintiff bears a heavy burden in attempting to invalidate a zoning ordinance because it does not follow a comprehensive plan in accordance with this section, and a court may strike down an amendment only if the amendment bears no reasonable relationship to the public health, safety or welfare. Sweetman v. Town of Cumberland, 117 R.I. 134, 364 A.2d 1277, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1608 (1976); Roberts v. Woonsocket, 575 F.2d 339, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 11053 (1st Cir. 1978).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The party challenging a zoning amendment has the burden of proving that the so-called comprehensive plan has not been followed. Mesolella v. Providence, 439 A.2d 1370, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 797 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If an amendment to a local zoning ordinance reasonably relates to the public health, safety, or welfare, then the comprehensive plan remains intact and the amendment is valid. Mesolella v. Providence, 439 A.2d 1370, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 797 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Local ordinances drawing distinction between a college and a religious institution in reference to dormitories and imposing off-street parking requirements applicable solely to colleges violated plaintiff-college’s right to equal protection under the fourteenth amendment, where the record contained no evidence that established any sort of rational basis for such distinction, nor was there evidence in record that provided a rationale for the city to establish differing parking requirements. Johnson &amp; Wales College v. DiPrete, 448 A.2d 1271, 1982 R.I. LEXIS 996 (R.I. 1982).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Variance.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was error for the trial court to uphold a special exception granted by the board of zoning review, where there was no finding by either the board or the trial court of adequate provision for sewage treatment for the proposed development. Guiberson v. Roman Catholic Bishop, 112 R.I. 252, 308 A.2d 503, 1973 R.I. LEXIS 978 (1973).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Zoning board of review’s denial of an applicant’s request for a special use permit was left undisturbed because the board properly concluded that the applicant’s proposed safety measures did not overcome the risk of contamination to a pure water source that would have been created had the applicant’s request to install underground gasoline storage tanks over a water reservoir been granted. Serra v. Charlestown Zoning Bd. of Review, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 38 (R.I. Feb. 6, 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Zoning Guides and Standards.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The provisions set out in former § 45-24-3 establish the objectives that are to be accomplished through an exercise of the zoning power by a local legislature. It is clear from the language used that they were intended to constitute norms and standards that would guide the local legislature in an exercise of the conferred power. Cianciarulo v. Tarro, 92 R.I. 352, 168 A.2d 719, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 40 (1961); Hadley v. Harold Realty Co., 97 R.I. 403, 198 A.2d 149, 1964 R.I. LEXIS 99 (1964).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was congestion and hazard and not traffic increase that was within the contemplation of the legislature in providing that zoning regulations should be “designed to lessen congestion in the streets * * *.” Such fact was not competent for the testimony of a non-expert witness. Thomson Methodist Church v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 99 R.I. 675, 210 A.2d 138, 1965 R.I. LEXIS 500 (1965).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Respondent adjoining property owners were aggrieved parties within the meaning of R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 45-24-31(4) and 45-24-69(a) and could appeal a decision of a town zoning board of review that petitioner property owners’ lot did not comply with the lot size requirements under town subdivision regulations.

<p class="p7"><b>Dimensional Variance.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As defined in this section, a dimensional variance may be granted only in connection with the enjoyment of a legally permitted beneficial use, not in conjunction with a use granted by special permit; consequently, the superior court was correct in determining that a special-use permit could not be combined with a dimensional variance. Newton v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 713 A.2d 239, 1998 R.I. LEXIS 205 (R.I. 1998).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the provisions of R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-41(c)(3) (now (d)(3)) are applicable and relevant for a dimensional variance when seeking dimensional relief for lawfully permitted uses, the review should not focus on the use of the parcel because a legislative determination has been made previously that the use is appropriate and does not adversely affect the general character of the area; a permitted use, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-31, is a use by right which is specifically authorized in a particular zoning district. Lischio v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 818 A.2d 685, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 57 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was error to deny reasonable litigation expenses to homeowners who prevailed in a zoning dispute under the Equal Access to Justice for Small Businesses and Individuals Act, § 42-92-1 et seq., on grounds a zoning board was not an agency and the hearing on the landowners’ variance application was not an adjudicatory proceeding because (1) zoning boards could make rules and decide contested cases, so they were agencies, and (2) the denial of a variance was akin to denying a permit.

<p class="p7"><b>Nonconforming Use.</b></p>

The zoning enforcement officer shall require that a declaration of the accessory family dwelling unit for the family member, or members, and its restrictions be recorded in the land evidence records and filed with the zoning enforcement officer and the building official. Once the family members with disabilities or who are sixty-two (62) years of age or older, or any other family member, no longer reside(s) in the premises on a permanent basis, or the title is transferred, the property owner shall notify the zoning official in writing, and the accessory family dwelling unit shall no longer be permitted, unless there is a subsequent, valid application.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Any city or town adopting or amending a zoning ordinance under this chapter shall make provision for any use, activity, structure, building, or sign or other improvement, lawfully existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of the zoning ordinance, but which is nonconforming by use or nonconforming by dimension. The zoning ordinance may regulate development which is nonconforming by dimension differently than that which is nonconforming by use.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The zoning ordinance shall permit the continuation of nonconforming development; however, this does not prohibit the regulation of nuisances.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> A zoning ordinance may provide that, if a nonconforming use is abandoned, it may not be reestablished. Abandonment of a nonconforming use consists of some overt act, or failure to act, which leads one to believe that the owner of the nonconforming use neither claims nor retains any interest in continuing the nonconforming use unless the owner can demonstrate an intent not to abandon the use. An involuntary interruption of nonconforming use, as by fire and natural catastrophe, does not establish the intent to abandon the nonconforming use; however, if any nonconforming use is halted for a period of one year, the owner of the nonconforming use is presumed to have abandoned the nonconforming use, unless that presumption is rebutted by the presentation of sufficient evidence of intent not to abandon the use.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the term “improvement” describes land which has been converted from its natural state to a different state and condition for the use and enjoyment of man, the use of land as parking area for camper trailers could be described as “improvement”. Little Compton v. Round Meadows, 108 R.I. 478, 276 A.2d 471, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1293 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Gasoline station signs constituted “improvements” within meaning of statute saving preexisting uses and amendatory zoning ordinance that would alter the status of the signs which was a nonconforming use were void as not being in conformity with the state enabling act.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court clearly erred by finding that alterations to a hotel were not permissible under R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-40(c), and the trial justice exceeded her authority under R.I. Gen. Law § 45-24-69(d) by misconstruing a city ordinance concerning alterations to nonconforming uses, as the ordinance did not prohibit alterations without a variance and the hotel’s improvements relating to the decking, stairs, parking area, and courtyards did not expand or change the use, or otherwise violate the ordinance. Cohen v. Duncan, 970 A.2d 550, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 61 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Nonconforming Use.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Owners did not have a lawful nonconforming use to keep horses on their property because it was extinguished when previous owners of the property manifested their intent to abandon that use of the land by applying for a zoning change to permit them to build condominiums on it; once abandoned, a nonconforming use cannot lawfully be revived.

<p class="p7"><b>— Abandonment and Discontinuance.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Discontinuance of a nonconforming use is not sufficient to show that the use has been abandoned; the circumstances surrounding the discontinuance must indicate an intention to abandon the use and the vested rights therein. A. T. &amp; G. v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 113 R.I. 458, 322 A.2d 294, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1200 (1974); East Greenwich v. Day, 119 R.I. 1, 375 A.2d 953, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 2110 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a five year discontinuance of a nonconforming use was unaccompanied by any overt act or failure to act indicating an intent to abandon, it was insufficient to extinguish the vested right in the nonconforming use. East Greenwich v. Day, 119 R.I. 1, 375 A.2d 953, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 2110 (1977).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The superior court properly reversed the decision of the zoning board that a nonconforming use, a two-family dwelling in a one-family dwelling zone, had been abandoned where the only evidence of intent to abandon in addition to discontinuance of the nonconforming use was the change from a two to a one family sewer assessment.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The mere discontinuance of a nonconforming use for a period of time does not constitute an abandonment of that use. Rather there must also exist an intent to abandon. Coventry v. Glickman, 429 A.2d 440, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1142 (R.I. 1981).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Nonuse of a nonconforming use is not conclusive evidence of abandonment. Coventry v. Glickman, 429 A.2d 440, 1981 R.I. LEXIS 1142 (R.I. 1981).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Abandonment cannot be proven by the mere passage of time but requires an intent on the part of the owner to relinquish the nonconforming use. M.B.T. Constr. Corp. v. Edwards, 528 A.2d 336, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 533 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Ordinance which would terminate a partially destroyed nonconforming use if reconstruction were not started within a year of the date of a casualty loss limited and restricted the owner’s rights by setting up an absolute time limit, and was therefore invalid and void. M.B.T. Constr. Corp. v. Edwards, 528 A.2d 336, 1987 R.I. LEXIS 533 (R.I. 1987).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>To establish abandonment, proof of two factors is required: (1) Intent to abandon; and (2) some overt act, or failure to act, which would lead one to believe that the owner neither claims nor retains any interest in the subject matter of the abandonment.

The zoning board shall hold a public hearing on any application for variance in an expeditious manner, after receipt, in proper form, of an application, and shall give public notice at least fourteen (14) days prior to the date of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or town. Notice of hearing shall be sent by first-class mail to the applicant, and to at least all those who would require notice under § 45-24-53. The notice shall also include the street address of the subject property. A zoning ordinance may require that a supplemental notice, that an application for a variance is under consideration, be posted at the location in question.

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former § 45-24-4.1 was not unconstitutional on its face as a denial of equal protection or due process because it did not authorize a wholly arbitrary differentiation per se and because it was subject to former § 45-24-3, which prohibits any arbitrary or discriminatory exercise of the amendatory power in making zoning regulations. Sweetman v. Town of Cumberland, 117 R.I. 134, 364 A.2d 1277, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1608 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The plain language of this provision does not differentiate between the type of variance sought by the applicant, but applies equally to requests for dimensional and use variances. Sciacca v. Caruso, 769 A.2d 578, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 90 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The trial justice misapplied this provision since he overlooked not only the applicant’s burden of proving “no other reasonable alternative” to enjoying the use of a substandard lot except by granting the requested variance, but also the fact that the applicant’s own conduct had created the lot and that the hardship imposed on her was therefore self-created. Sciacca v. Caruso, 769 A.2d 578, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 90 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the provisions of R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-41(c)(3) are applicable and relevant for a dimensional variance when seeking dimensional relief for lawfully permitted uses, the review should not focus on the use of the parcel because a legislative determination has been made previously that the use is appropriate and does not adversely affect the general character of the area; a permitted use, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-31(52) [now (54)], is a use by right which is specifically authorized in a particular zoning district. Lischio v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 818 A.2d 685, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 57 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When the owners of a parcel in a general business zone sought a dimensional variance to allow them to build a self-storage facility, the trial court erroneously failed to consider, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-41(d)(2), whether the hardship suffered by the owners if the variance was not granted would be more than a mere inconvenience such that they had no other reasonable alternative to enjoy a legally permitted beneficial use of the property. Lischio v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 818 A.2d 685, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 57 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There is a distinction in R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-41 between the evidentiary showing necessary for a use variance and the lesser threshold for a dimensional variance: R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-41(d)(1) applies to a use variance and requires a showing of a loss of all beneficial use and R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-41(d)(2) applies to a dimensional variance and requires a showing of hardship amounting to more than a mere inconvenience, and while it is not apparent on the face of the text whether the provisions of R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-41(c), regarding the evidence required for a variance, apply to either use or dimensional variances or both, the requirements for obtaining a dimensional variance are listed in § 45-24-41(c) and (d), and the plain language of § 45-24-41(c) does not differentiate between the type of variance sought by an applicant; rather, it applies equally to requests for dimensional, as well as for use variances, so it is clear from previous case law that in order for a request for a dimensional variance to be granted the applicant must satisfy the requirements for both § 45-24-41(c) and (d)(2). Lischio v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 818 A.2d 685, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 57 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Construction With Other Statutes.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Prior to the 1976 amendment of former § 45-24-4.1, which deleted a 1972 proviso permitting a town or city council in approving a zoning change to limit such change to one of the permitted uses in the zone to which the subject land is rezoned, the imposition of conditions on land rezoned by amendment did not violate the uniformity requirement of former § 45-24-2 simply because those conditions were not imposed on land in the same use category but not covered by the amendment. Sweetman v. Town of Cumberland, 117 R.I. 134, 364 A.2d 1277, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1608 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Effect of Amendments.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The 1991 amendments to the state’s zoning laws, by providing for only two categories of variance (a use variance or a dimensional variance) and by prescribing that the obtaining of a dimensional variance must be contingent upon there being no other reasonable alternative for the enjoyment of a legally permitted beneficial use of the property, effectively ended the old doctrine that had allowed a property owner to obtain a dimensional variance simply by demonstrating an adverse impact amounting to more than a mere inconvenience. Sciacca v. Caruso, 769 A.2d 578, 2001 R.I. LEXIS 90 (R.I. 2001).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Recent amendment to R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-41(d)(2) required an applicant for a dimensional variance to demonstrate only that the hardship the applicant would suffer if the dimensional variance was not granted amounted to more than a mere inconvenience, reinstating the judicially created doctrine which held that for an applicant to obtain a dimensional variance, the landowner needed to show only an adverse impact that amounted to more than a mere inconvenience, rather than a loss of all beneficial use of a parcel absent a variance.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In order to determine whether notice was sufficient under former § 45-24-4.1, the court applied the same test it used under §§ 45-24-4 and 45-24-18, that is, whether the notice was sufficient to inform an ordinary layman lacking expertise in zoning matters of the property affected and the changes sought. Sweetman v. Town of Cumberland, 117 R.I. 134, 364 A.2d 1277, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1608 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though the notice received by plaintiff did not identify the property to be rezoned by map, by address or by metes and bounds, it satisfied the notice requirements since it informed plaintiff on what road the property was located and that it was within 200 feet of his own land.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Owners of a parcel in a general business zone were entitled to a dimensional variance regarding the frontage required for access to a public street because their proposed use of the parcel was permitted in a general business zone but the parcel’s frontage was too small to allow them to gain access to a public street without a variance, so they would be deprived of any legally permitted beneficial use of their property without a variance, which exceeded the burden they had to meet to be entitled to a dimensional variance.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A town may amend its zoning ordinance to exempt from its provisions the erection by the town or any of its agencies of a building for governmental purposes and an amendment exempting such erection for “public or municipal purposes” will be construed as such an amendment. Nunes v. Bristol, 102 R.I. 729, 232 A.2d 775, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 745 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was not an abuse of discretion for the town council to amend the zoning ordinance by changing from residential to commercial zoning a parcel of four lots which adjoined a residential area on one side when all other property on both sides of the highway on which the parcel was located as far as the eye could see in either direction was devoted to commercial use. Willey v. Town Council of Barrington, 106 R.I. 544, 261 A.2d 627, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 956 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Conformity to Comprehensive Plan.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Zoning ordinance amendments are subject to the statutory requirements of comprehensiveness. D'Angelo v. Knights of Columbus Bldg. Ass'n, 89 R.I. 76, 151 A.2d 495, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 59 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The limit of power of local legislatures in the enactment of a zoning ordinance apply to an exercise of the amendatory power only to the extent that the change effected by such amendment must be in conformity with the comprehensive plan, because haphazard or improper zoning may result as well from an exercise of the amendatory power as from an exercise of the power to enact an original ordinance. Cianciarulo v. Tarro, 92 R.I. 352, 168 A.2d 719, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 40 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>When changing zoning regulations by amending a part of the ordinance, the local legislature is required to have such change conform to the comprehensive plan of zoning in effect in the municipality, this requirement being mandatory. Town &amp; County Mobile Homes v. Inspector of Bldgs., 93 R.I. 383, 175 A.2d 556, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 119 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A relatively small area should not be rezoned for multi-family dwellings when that small area remains completely surrounded, with the exception of the eastern boundary, by predominately one-family homes in an A zone (one-family dwellings). Toole v. May-Day Realty Corp., 101 R.I. 379, 223 A.2d 545, 1966 R.I. LEXIS 402 (1966).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The rezoning of property from a residential to a business use on the condition that the land rezoned shall be devoted exclusively to the business use for which application to rezone was made, or otherwise remain residential, constitutes zoning without regard to the public health, safety, and welfare, concern for which is basic to that comprehensiveness contemplated in this act. Oury v. Greany, 107 R.I. 427, 267 A.2d 700, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 790 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>General Powers of Council.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Petitioner did not have the right to a review of the city council’s action in amending a zoning ordinance as the action is clearly legislative and in no sense judicial. Rhode Island Home Builders v. Hunt, 74 R.I. 255, 60 A.2d 496, 1948 R.I. LEXIS 82 (1948); Alianiello v. Town Council of E. Providence, 83 R.I. 395, 117 A.2d 233, 1955 R.I. LEXIS 72 (1955).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An exercise of the power to amend the provisions of a zoning ordinance, like the power to enact a zoning ordinance, is limited to that conferred in the enabling statute. Cianciarulo v. Tarro, 92 R.I. 352, 168 A.2d 719, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 40 (1961).</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Judicial Review.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Actions taken by a city or town council pursuant to former § 45-24-5 were considered purely legislative in character and thus enjoy an initial presumption of validity, and were not generally susceptible of judicial review unless violative of the city’s entire comprehensive zoning plan. Ruby Assoc. v. Ferranti, 603 A.2d 331, 1992 R.I. LEXIS 35 (R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Legislative Immunity.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><b>Limitation on Powers of Board of Review.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Action of board in approving limited extension of a factory by permitting erection of an addition in a more restricted area did not amount to an amendment of the zoning ordinance where the addition merely covered additional portions of lots already partly occupied. Bruzzi v. Board of Appeals, 84 R.I. 220, 122 A.2d 877, 1956 R.I. LEXIS 48 (1956).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Power of board of review to grant exceptions did not include the right to permit multiple dwellings in an area containing almost 160,000 square feet of land which was part of an area restricted to one family use since to do so would effect a substantial change in the lines of the zone which is reserved to the council. Adams v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 86 R.I. 396, 135 A.2d 357, 1957 R.I. LEXIS 116 (1957).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the town council amended the zoning ordinance by changing the zoning of two lots from residental to limited business on condition that an office building be erected and operated upon the two lots, the zoning board of review could not pass upon the validity of such a condition on an appeal from the refusal of the building inspector to grant a permit for the erection of a restaurant on the two lots. Arc-Lan Co. v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 106 R.I. 474, 261 A.2d 280, 1970 R.I. LEXIS 945 (1970).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The fact that the city may voluntarily have given written notice in instances involving specific amendments to the zoning ordinance at other times is no basis for holding that it is required to do that which it is not compelled to do by the enabling act or the ordinance.

The zoning ordinance must designate the local official or agency and specify minimum qualifications for the person or persons charged with its administration and enforcement, including: (1) the issuing of any required permits or certificates; (2) collection of required fees; (3) keeping of records showing the compliance of uses of land; (4) authorizing commencement of uses or development under the provisions of the zoning ordinance; (5) inspection of suspected violations; (6) issuance of violation notices with required correction action; (7) collection of fines for violations; and (8) performing any other duties and taking any actions that may be assigned in the ordinance. In order to provide guidance or clarification, the zoning enforcement officer or agency shall, upon written request, issue a zoning certificate or provide information to the requesting party as to the determination by the official or agency within fifteen (15) days of the written request. In the event that no written response is provided within that time, the requesting party has the right to appeal to the zoning board of review for the determination.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the board gave no reasons for denying the special exception requested by the petitioner and there was no competent evidence to offset that offered by the petitioner in support of such special exception the denial of the application was arbitrary and an abuse of the discretion with which the board is vested and will be reversed by the court.

<p class="p7"><b>Findings of Board.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In granting an exception, it was incumbent upon the board to make a finding as to the effect of the exception, as granted, upon the public convenience and welfare; and, if such finding be negative, the board was without authority to act affirmatively.

<p class="p7"><b>Matters Considered.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The primary purpose of a hearing on an application for an exception is to assist the board of review to determine if said exception is consistent with the general welfare and not to test the strength of conflicting personal desires and interests or to poll the neighborhood.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Finding that exception, if granted, would devalue surrounding property constituted a finding that surrounding property would be substantially injured within meaning of ordinance limiting action of zoning board of review and exception was properly refused. Hazen v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 90 R.I. 108, 155 A.2d 333, 1959 R.I. LEXIS 122 (1959).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>While it is true that a board of review should not ordinarily grant an exception where the area of land involved is unusually extensive, such a circumstance is not necessarily controlling. Gallagher v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 95 R.I. 225, 186 A.2d 325, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 151 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The board of review, in granting an exception, should limit its consideration to whether the applicant has established a right to a grant of an exception as provided in the ordinance, and not concern itself with the effect thereof on the objective of the zoning ordinance.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An application for an exception for a particular use should not be denied either for lack of proof that there is a community or a neighborhood need for its establishment or because the proof is that there is no such need; nor should a use be permitted on the sole ground that it will serve the community or neighborhood needs or accommodate the public.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It was the plain intent of the legislature to provide that a zoning board of review when conducting hearings and arriving at their decisions should at all times consist of five participating members. The fact that the petitioners agreed to the procedure adopted by the board when the chairman continued to conduct the meeting but did not vote is of no significance. The statutory provision that the board of review shall consist of five members is a jurisdictional requirement and cannot be altered by the parties nor can the parties vest the board with jurisdiction not granted by the enabling act. Bove v. Board of Review, 95 R.I. 197, 185 A.2d 751 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The 1949 amendment to former § 45-24-14, providing for a sixth auxiliary member to sit in the absence of one of the regular members, made five participating members essential to jurisdiction and action by the board in which four members voted affirmatively and the chairman abstained was void.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the power to designate zoning classifications is vested exclusively in a city council, a variance granted by a zoning board on the ground that the area had been improperly zoned is invalid as there is no power in board to establish zones. Abbott v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 78 R.I. 84, 79 A.2d 620, 1951 R.I. LEXIS 39 (1951).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where the power to make and amend zoning ordinances lay in the city council it was arbitrary and illegal for the zoning board to grant a variance for location of a lumber yard in an area classified by ordinance as residential on the ground that the ordinance was improper.

Cole v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 94 R.I. 265, 179 A.2d 846, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 62 (1962).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Dismissal of a neighborhood association’s declaratory judgment action against a preservation society was appropriate because the issues presented in the association’s complaint—interpretation of zoning ordinances, review of the society’s application, and determination whether to grant a special use permit—were within a local zoning board of review’s jurisdiction and authority, and the association failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.

<p class="p7"><b>In General.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The legislature conferred upon the local legislatures authority to invoke judicial assistance by the institution of an appropriate proceeding in the name of the municipality through the action of the city or town solicitor and in so doing the legislature intended to limit the exercise of jurisdiction by the courts in the enforcement of zoning ordinances to such proceedings only as were brought in the name of a municipality by its designated municipal legal officer and in so doing intended to exclude individual landowners from the institution of unnecessary litigation that would only burden the courts. Lincoln v. Cournoyer, 95 R.I. 280, 186 A.2d 728, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 162 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former §§ 45-24-7 and 45-24-6 together disclose a complete overall legislative scheme for the enforcement of zoning provisions and confer exclusive jurisdiction in those matters upon the courts, precluding a local legislative body from effectively making a similar grant of such jurisdiction to the zoning board. Mauran v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 104 R.I. 604, 247 A.2d 853, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 691 (1968).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section requires a separate judicial proceeding; a motion to comply, filed by the zoning board, not the town, at the conclusion of a property owner’s zoning appeal, simply does not pass muster.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Under the extraordinary facts of the case, the Superior Court erred by denying a property owner’s motion under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) to vacate an order compelling him to remove his garage because a separate judicial proceeding was required under § 45-24-62; the zoning board’s “Motion for Order to Comply”, filed at the conclusion of the property owner’s zoning appeal, was not a “due proceeding” in the name of the city or town, as required by the statute. Moreover, at the time the zoning board filed the motion for order to comply, final judgment had entered in the zoning appeal. McLaughlin v. Zoning Bd. of Review of Tiverton, 186 A.3d 597, 2018 R.I. LEXIS 86 (R.I. 2018).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Order compelling a property owner to remove his garage was not void under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4) because (1) § 45-24-62 clearly vested in the Superior Court the jurisdiction to order the owner to remove his garage; and (2) as the owner was provided with notice and afforded an opportunity to be heard, the order did not go so beyond the pale as to evince “a plain usurpation of power constituting a violation of due process”.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Former § 45-24-7 requires that any equitable actions brought in the name of the municipality pursuant to former § 45-24-6 for the enforcement thereof must be brought by the municipality only, exclusively through its city or town solicitor; and precludes the local legislature from effectively designating the building inspector to bring such actions. Mauran v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 104 R.I. 604, 247 A.2d 853, 1968 R.I. LEXIS 691 (1968).</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Exhaustion of the administrative appeal provided for in this section is not required as a prerequisite to a civil suit where an attempt to have the board of review grant a special exemption or variance would be futile. Annicelli v. South Kingstown, 463 A.2d 133, 1983 R.I. LEXIS 1010 (R.I. 1983).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Findings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court clearly erred by finding that alterations to a hotel were not permissible under R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-40(c), and the trial justice exceeded her authority under R.I. Gen. Law § 45-24-69(d) by misconstruing a city ordinance concerning alterations to nonconforming uses, as the ordinance did not prohibit alterations without a variance and the hotel’s improvements relating to the decking, stairs, parking area, and courtyards did not expand or change the use, or otherwise violate the ordinance. Cohen v. Duncan, 970 A.2d 550, 2009 R.I. LEXIS 61 (R.I. 2009).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Malicious Prosecution or Abuse of Process.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The appeal of the issuance of a building permit to a zoning board of review constitutes the initiation of a legal proceeding for purposes of a claim for malicious prosecution or a claim for abuse of process. Hillside Assocs. v. Stravato, 642 A.2d 664, 1994 R.I. LEXIS 175 (R.I. 1994).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Persons Aggrieved.</b></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A tenant at sufferance did not have sufficient interest to support an application for a variance. Gallagher v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 95 R.I. 225, 186 A.2d 325, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 151 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Power of Board.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the power of the building inspector is restricted to enforce the zoning ordinances as enacted, the power of the board is much broader and it may provide relief in hardship cases on appeal. Ajootian v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 85 R.I. 441, 132 A.2d 836, 1957 R.I. LEXIS 49 (1957).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Procedure.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Applicants for a building permit who are denied such permit by the building inspector should appeal to the zoning board of review from such ruling and making him and his records a part of the proceedings. Kent v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 102 R.I. 258, 229 A.2d 769, 1967 R.I. LEXIS 679 (1967).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where a zoning board order has been appealed under this section a party to the proceeding may not circumvent this administrative procedure by seeking injunctive relief in the courts. Hartunian v. Matteson, 109 R.I. 509, 288 A.2d 485, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 1213 (1972). See also Hartunian v. Matteson, 108 R.I. 938, 278 A.2d 867, 1971 R.I. LEXIS 1489 (1971).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Time for Appeal.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An appeal was not taken by adjoining property owner within a reasonable time where formal appeal was not taken until the work done under the building permit was substantially completed even though verbal objections had been made prior thereto. MacGregor v. Zoning of Review, 94 R.I. 362, 180 A.2d 811, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 84 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an appeal was not filed within 30 days from the date of the issuance of the building permit, the board did not err in denying it on the issue of timeliness, further the board was bound by the provisions of the ordinance providing that appeals must be taken within a reasonable time but in no case shall such reasonable time exceed 30 days. MacGregor v. Zoning of Review, 94 R.I. 362, 180 A.2d 811, 1962 R.I. LEXIS 84 (1962).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A municipal ordinance passed pursuant to this and related sections, which provide for an appeal within a reasonable time, cannot abridge such right of appeal by arbitrary time limit. Hartunian v. Matteson, 109 R.I. 509, 288 A.2d 485, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 1213 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although question not squarely before court in this case, it held that, if it were, it probably would be constrained to hold that a rule adopted by a zoning board of review pursuant to this section limiting time of appeal to an arbitrary period from the date of the decision appealed from, rather than from the time when appellant was chargeable with knowledge of such decision would be invalid as contrary to the intent of the general assembly. Hartunian v. Matteson, 109 R.I. 509, 288 A.2d 485, 1972 R.I. LEXIS 1213 (1972).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where appeal, although filed more than 30 days after building permits issued, was filed day after petitioners learned nature of construction, appeal was reasonable and not untimely. Hardy v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 113 R.I. 375, 321 A.2d 289, 1974 R.I. LEXIS 1189 (1974).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The determination of the timeliness of appeal must depend upon the peculiar facts of the instant case. Zeilstra v. Barrington Zoning Bd. of Review, 417 A.2d 303, 1980 R.I. LEXIS 1672 (R.I. 1980).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A reasonable time for the appeal from the grant of a building permit does not necessarily begin to run the moment the permit is issued or the construction commenced.

<p class="p6">An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the zoning enforcement officer or agency from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the zoning board of review, after an appeal has been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would in the officer’s or agency’s opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction on application and upon notice to the officer or agency from whom the appeal is taken on due cause shown.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There was no merit in petitioner’s contention that the optionee of land had no standing before the board of review to seek a special exception or variance since the owner of the land joined in the application, and was represented at the hearing by counsel.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In appeals from decisions of historic zoning commissions under § 45-24.1-7 where ordinance provided for appeals under this section, the board does not merely exercise appellate jurisdiction, limited as it were to a review of the record compiled at a hearing held by the commission, rather it is authorized to consider the question de novo. Hayes v. Smith, 92 R.I. 173, 167 A.2d 546, 1961 R.I. LEXIS 12 (1961).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The statutory notice of hearing on an application for an exception is not given to poll the neighborhood on the question involved but is to give interested parties an opportunity to present facts which would assist the zoning board in determining whether to grant or deny the application. Petrarca v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 78 R.I. 130, 80 A.2d 156, 1951 R.I. LEXIS 47 (1951).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A public notice of appeal concerning the moving of a dwelling “from lot #7 to lot #300” was a proper constructive notice under this section since it properly described the property even though the zoning board of review found that the application was for removal of the dwelling from one location to another on the same lot.

<p class="p7"><b>Sufficiency of Notice.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since public notice and notice to interested parties is required to be given of the hearing on appeal, board was without jurisdiction where variance in question affected both lots 52 and 165 and the application and advertisement only set out the proposal as involving lot 52.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice given of hearing by zoning board on application for exception or variance was adequate though it misstated the identity of one of the applicants, where it gave the time of hearing and the relief sought and correctly identified the other applicant and the land involved.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice of an appeal from the decision of the building inspector granting a permit for the erection of a restaurant on lots 78 and 79 which referred only to lot 79 was deficient although the tax assessors had on the day of the filing of the appeal merged the two lots into lot 79 for tax purposes.

Sweetman v. Town of Cumberland, 117 R.I. 134, 364 A.2d 1277, 1976 R.I. LEXIS 1608 (1976).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Notice of hearing on application for zoning relief must be reasonably calculated to inform interested parties of the pendency of the action, of the precise character of the relief sought, and of the particular property to be affected, but need not necessarily be letter-perfect; where, however, a notice incorrectly described the affected property’s lot number, and the remaining language insufficiently identified the property, the notice was fatally defective as there was a possibility that an interested person could be misled into inaction or left in doubt concerning the specific properties involved. Paquette v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 118 R.I. 109, 372 A.2d 973, 1977 R.I. LEXIS 1436 (1977).</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> An aggrieved party may appeal a decision of the zoning board of review to the superior court for the county in which the city or town is situated by filing a complaint stating the reasons of appeal within twenty (20) days after the decision has been recorded and posted in the office of the city or town clerk. The decision shall be posted in a location visible to the public in the city or town hall for a period of twenty (20) days following the recording of the decision in the office of the city or town clerk. The zoning board of review shall file the original documents acted upon by it and constituting the record of the case appealed from, or certified copies, together with other facts that may be pertinent, with the clerk of the court within thirty (30) days after being served with a copy of the complaint. When the complaint is filed by someone other than the original applicant or appellant, the original applicant or appellant and the members of the zoning board are made parties to the proceedings.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> An appeal of an enactment of or an amendment to a zoning ordinance may be taken to the superior court for the county in which the municipality is situated by filing a complaint within thirty (30) days after the enactment or amendment has become effective. The appeal may be taken by an aggrieved party or by any legal resident or landowner of the municipality or by any group of residents or landowners whether or not incorporated, of the municipality. The appeal shall not stay the enforcement of the zoning ordinance, as enacted or amended, but the court may, in its discretion, grant a stay on appropriate terms, which may include the filing of a bond, and make other orders that it deems necessary for an equitable disposition of the appeal.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The complaint shall state with specificity the area or areas in which the enactment or amendment does not conform with the comprehensive plan and/or the manner in which it constitutes a taking of private property without just compensation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury. The court shall first consider whether the enactment or amendment of the zoning ordinance is in conformance with the comprehensive plan. If the enactment or amendment is not in conformance with the comprehensive plan, then the court shall invalidate the enactment or the amendment, or those parts of the enactment or amendment which are not in conformance with the comprehensive plan. The court shall not revise the ordinance to conform with the comprehensive plan, but may suggest appropriate language as part of the court decision.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> In the case of an aggrieved party, where the court has found that the enactment or amendment of the zoning ordinance is in conformance with the comprehensive plan, then the court shall next determine whether the enactment or amendment works as a taking of property from the aggrieved party. If the court determines that there has been a taking, the court shall remand the case to the legislative body of the municipality, with its findings that a taking has occurred, and order the municipality to either provide just compensation or rescind the enactment or amendment within thirty (30) days.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The superior court retains jurisdiction, in the event that the aggrieved party and the municipality do not agree on the amount of compensation, in which case the superior court shall hold further hearings to determine and to award compensation. The superior court retains jurisdiction to determine the amount of an award of compensation for any temporary taking, if that taking exists.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The court may, in its discretion, upon the motion of the parties or on its own motion, award reasonable attorney’s fees to any party to an appeal, including a municipality.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Applicability.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the plaintiff developer’s brought an action for a declaratory judgment on whether zoning ordinances that hindered its ability to develop a parcel of property were validly enacted, the motion judge should have construed the action as one for a declaratory judgment pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-30-1 rather than as an appeal of the enactment of an amendment to a zoning ordinance under R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-71(a). Since the question of whether the zoning ordinances violated the notice requirement of R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-53 could be the subject a declaration, the case should have been decided under the declaratory judgment statute and not found to be time barred as effectively an “appeal.” Tucker Estates Charlestown, LLC v.

<p class="p7"><b>“Association” Construed.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A nonprofit corporation whose members were municipal residents and local landowners could not qualify as an “association” for purposes of appealing a zoning amendment, since the word “association” as used in this provision refers to an unincorporated entity that is distinct from and different from a corporation.

<p class="p7"><b>Legislative Intent.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By foreclosing residents and landowners from forming a corporation to challenge a zoning amendment, the legislature apparently believed that those citizens who seek to mount such a challenge should not be able to insulate themselves against either personal responsibility for any fees or costs that may be assessed in connection with the prosecution or defense of zoning appeals, or from public identification of their relationship to such a challenge.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Absent authority to review a city council’s failure to enact a zoning amendment, a mandatory injunction was beyond court authority and a cross appeal was properly denied. P.J.C. Realty v. Barry, 811 A.2d 1202, 2002 R.I. LEXIS 252 (R.I. 2002).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Waiver of Argument.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even though residents argued on appeal that the effective date of an amended zoning ordinance was upon printing and publication under R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-6-7, rather than R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-71, the residents failed to inform the motion justice of the legal bases for their objection to summary judgment and thus, waived the argument on appeal. Dallman v.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The commission shall, within twelve (12) months of the date the local historic district zoning ordinance takes effect:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Adopt and publish all rules and regulations necessary to carry out its functions under the provisions of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Publish standards as necessary to inform historic district residents, property owners, and the general public of those criteria by which the commission determines whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness. The commission may amend these standards as reasonably necessary, and it shall publish all amendments.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Before a property owner or public utility as defined in subdivision 39-1-2(20) that is installing a gas regulator or gas meter may authorize or commence construction, alteration, repair, removal, or demolition affecting the exterior appearance of a structure or its appurtenances within a historic district or affecting a historic cemetery wherever located within a city or town, the owner or public utility must apply for and receive a certificate of appropriateness from the commission. In applying, the owner or public utility must comply with application procedures established by the commission pursuant to this chapter and the applicable local ordinance. The commission shall require the owner or public utility to submit information which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the proposed construction, alteration, repair, removal, or demolition, including, but not limited to, plans, drawings, photographs, or other information. The owner of the property or the public utility must obtain a certificate of appropriateness for the project whether or not state law requires that he, she or it also obtain a permit from the local building official. The building official shall not issue a permit until the commission has granted a certificate of appropriateness.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> In the case of a historic cemetery, the owner must comply with all provisions of law and make suitable and appropriate provisions for the reinterment of any human remains in an established cemetery. Original or existing headstones and markers shall be preserved and installed at the site of the reinterment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> In reviewing plans, the commission shall give consideration to:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The historic and architectural significance of the structure and its appurtenances;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The way in which the structure and its appurtenances contribute to the historical and architectural significance of the district; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The appropriateness of the general design, arrangement, texture, materials, and siting proposed in the plans.</p>
<p class="p6">The commission shall pass only on exterior features of a structure and its appurtenances and shall not consider interior arrangements.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> All decisions of the commission shall be in writing. The commission shall articulate and explain the reasons and bases of each decision on a record, and, in the case of a decision not to issue a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall include in the bases for its conclusion that the proposed activity would be incongruous with those aspects of the structure, appurtenances, or the district which the commission has determined to be historically or architecturally significant. The commission shall send a copy of the decision to the applicant.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> In the case of an application for construction, repair, alteration, removal, or demolition affecting the exterior appearance of a structure, or its appurtenances, which the commission deems so valuable to the city, town, state, or nation, that the loss of that structure will be a great loss to the city, town, state, or nation, the commission shall endeavor to work out with the owner an economically feasible plan for the preservation of that structure. Unless the commission is satisfied that the retention of the structure constitutes a hazard to public safety, which hazard cannot be eliminated by economic means available to the owner, including the sale of the structure to any purchaser willing to preserve the structure, or unless the commission votes to issue a certificate of appropriateness for the proposed construction, alteration, repair, removal, or demolition, the commission shall file with the building official or duly delegated authority its rejection of the application. In the absence of a change in the structure arising from casualty, no new application for the same or similar work shall be filed within one year after the rejection.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> In the case of any structure deemed to be valuable for the period of architecture it represents and important to the neighborhood within which it exists, the commission may file with the building official, or other duly delegated authority its certificate of appropriateness for an application if any of the circumstances under which a certificate of appropriateness might have been given under subsection (6) are in existence or if:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Preservation of the structure is a deterrent to a major improvement program which will be of substantial benefit to the community;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Preservation of the structure would cause undue or unreasonable financial hardship to the owner, taking into account the financial resources available to the owner, including the sale of the structure to any purchaser willing to preserve the structure; or</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The preservation of the structure would not be in the interest of the majority of the community.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> When considering an application to demolish or remove a structure of historic or architectural value, the commission shall assist the owner in identifying and evaluating alternatives to demolition, including the sale of the structure and its present site. In addition to any other criteria, the commission also shall consider whether there is a reasonable likelihood that some person or group other than the current owner is willing to purchase, move, and preserve the structure, and whether the owner has made continuing, bona fide, and reasonable efforts to sell the structure to any purchaser willing to move and preserve the structure.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> No less than fifteen (15) days after receiving an application to demolish or to remove an historic cemetery, the commission shall forward the application to the commission to study historic cemeteries. The commission shall also immediately forward to the commission to study historic cemeteries its finding of fact, if any, together with its action on the application.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the board’s discretion cannot be entirely eliminated because of the subjective nature of this process, the court believes the standards set forth in the historic-zoning legislation sufficiently alert the public of the statute’s scope and meaning. Accordingly, the court finds this enabling legislation does not violate the due-process clause. Bellevue Shopping Ctr. Ass'n v. Chase, 574 A.2d 760, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 100 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Consideration of Criteria.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The board did not err in its application of the criteria set forth in chapter 1278.04(C)(3) of the Newport Planning and Zoning Code. Chapter 1278(C)(5) instructs the board to “be lenient in its judgment” of plans for new construction unless the plans would “seriously impair the historic or architectural value of the surrounding structures.” In this instance the board made a specific finding that the owner’s proposed project would seriously impair the historic and architectural value of the surrounding area. Consequently, the board was justified in employing a strict standard in reviewing the owner’s proposal. Bellevue Shopping Ctr. Ass'n v. Chase, 574 A.2d 760, 1990 R.I. LEXIS 100 (R.I. 1990).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Hearings.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although the enabling act provides that all meetings shall be open to the public there is nothing to suggest that the taking of testimony by the commission at any such public meeting is a mandatory prerequisite to the exercise of its judgment.

<p class="p6">A city or town may by ordinance empower city or town councils in consultation with the historic district commission to identify structures of historical or architectural value whose deteriorated physical condition endangers the preservation of the structure or its appurtenances. The council shall publish standards for maintenance of properties within historic districts. Upon the petition of the historic district commission that a historic structure is so deteriorated that its preservation is endangered, the council may establish a reasonable time not less than thirty (30) days within which the owner must begin repairs. If the owner has not begun repairs within the allowed time, the council shall hold a hearing at which the owner may appear and state his or her reasons for not commencing repairs. If the owner does not appear at the hearing or does not comply with the council’s orders, the council may cause the required repairs to be made at the expense of the city or town and cause a lien to be placed against the property for repayment.</p>

<p class="p6">The commission shall file with the building official or other duly delegated authority its certificate of appropriateness or rejection of all plans submitted to it for review. No work shall begin until the certificate has been filed, but, in the case of rejection the certificate is binding upon the building official or other duly delegated authority and no permit shall be issued in such a case. The failure of the commission to act within forty-five (45) days from the date of an application filed with it, unless an extension is agreed upon mutually by the applicant and the commission, is deemed to constitute approval. In the event, however, that the historic district commission makes a finding of fact that the circumstances of a particular application require further time for additional study and information than can be obtained within the period of forty-five (45) days, then the commission has a period of up to ninety (90) days within which to act upon the application.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> It is found that there exists, and may in the future exist within the state of Rhode Island, premises, dwellings, dwelling units, rooming units, structures, or parts thereof, which by reason of their structure, equipment, sanitation, maintenance, use, or occupancy, affect or are likely to adversely affect the public health, including the physical, mental, and social well-being of persons and families, safety, and general welfare. To correct and prevent the existence of these adverse conditions, and to achieve and maintain levels of residential environmental quality as will protect and promote health, safety, and general welfare, it is further found that the establishment of minimum housing standards for the state of Rhode Island is required.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> It is further found that conditions existing on blighted premises are dangerous to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the people, and that conditions existing on blighted premises necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditure of public funds for public health and safety, crime prevention, fire protection, and other public services, and that the conditions existing on blighted premises cause a drain upon public revenue, impairing the efficient and economical exercise of governmental functions in these areas.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> It is further found that the elimination of blighted premises, and the prevention of the recurrence of blighted premises, is in the best interest of the public, and that the accomplishment of this end will be fostered and encouraged by the enactment of this chapter.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> It is declared that there exist within the various cities of the state, including, but not limited to, Providence, numerous railroad or former railroad properties and adjacent lands that are or may be the subject of railroad relocation projects involving the coordination of federal, state, local, and private action. These areas represent or are contiguous with urban areas of historical, aesthetic, social, cultural, and economic importance, and are an important public asset.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> It is further declared that there is a statewide need for coordinated attention to and supervision of the development of these areas for the purpose of preserving for the education, enjoyment, and welfare of the general public, important historical and aesthetic features, the promotion of commercial and economic development, the attraction to our urban centers of appropriate business, industrial, and tourist trade, resources, and investment, the development of an attractive urban environment that fosters the social welfare and health of the public and is harmonious with the social, historic, and cultural environment that already exists, and the harmonious coordination of the federal, state, local, and private action that influences the urban railroad relocation project.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> It is further declared that the developmental tools presently available to cities in the state do not contain sufficient flexibility to address the unique problems arising from the urban railroad relocation project and to govern comprehensive and coordinated development of areas subject to these projects consistently with the previously-declared public needs and purposes. Proper development of these areas, consistent with the general welfare, may require designation of special land use districts and special land-use controls which may be more stringent or more flexible than existing zoning, planning, and other developmental tools, and may require the adoption, implementation, and administration of a plan that establishes a framework for development and sets out detailed design and development criteria, regulations, and enforcement procedures.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> It is further declared that the most efficient and effective method to further the previously-declared public policy of the state to encourage the appropriate, comprehensive, and coordinated development of railroad or former railroad properties and adjacent lands that are or may be the subject of railroad relocation projects involving federal, state, local, and private action, is to permit the creation of special development districts in the cities of the state and the creation of special development district commissions to adopt, implement, and administer plans of development that establish and enforce design and development criteria and regulations for the development of these areas.</p>

<p class="p6">The general assembly recognizes and declares that:</p>
<p class="p6">Septic systems or individual subsurface disposal systems (ISDS) are prone to failure without proper maintenance. ISDS failure poses a risk to public health through the contamination of the state’s surface and underground waters. Improperly treated waste water from malfunctioning ISDS can impair or prevent the use of the state’s waters for drinking and domestic purposes, as well as swimming, wildlife habitat, boating, fishing, and other water-based recreation. In many suburban and rural areas of the state, the use of ISDS is the only practical or available means to treat waste water. Most community and individual drinking water supplies and some of the state’s prime recreational waters are located in areas that rely on ISDS. Recreational and drinking supply waters are the least tolerant of waste water contamination and, therefore, require rigorous protection. ISDS will continue, for the near term, to be the primary means of waste water treatment in many areas of the state where public and private water supplies and recreational waters exist. Therefore, to help avoid both contamination of state waters and the associated risks to the public health, and to help preserve the natural ecosystems, waste water disposal systems must be properly maintained to prevent their malfunction and/or failure.</p>

<p class="p6">The purpose of this chapter is to authorize the cities and towns of the state to adopt ordinances creating waste water management districts (WWMD), the boundaries of which may include all or a part of a city or town, as specified by the ordinance. These ordinances must be designated to eliminate and prevent the contamination of state waters, caused by malfunctioning individual subsurface disposal systems (ISDS), through the implementation of ISDS inspection and maintenance programs. The waste water management district ordinance programs shall be designed to operate as both an alternative to municipal sewer systems and as a method to protect surface and ground waters from contamination.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> According to the United States Census Bureau estimates as of 2015, Rhode Island ranks second among the fifty (50) states in terms of population density. Notwithstanding this, there exists within the various municipalities of the state, certain large tracts of developable or blighted state-owned land, which areas represent in and of themselves and are often contiguous with areas of vital economic importance to the state. In light of this, the state declares that these tracts of state-owned land, and more specifically those tracts that are twenty (20) or more contiguous acres in size, are important state assets which require the coordination of federal, state, local, or private action to efficiently make use of these lands.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> It is further declared that coordination is paramount to development as time delays, redundant approvals, and local eccentricities often impede development projects.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> It is further declared that there is a statewide need for coordinated attention to and supervision of the development of these areas for the purpose of education, enjoyment, and welfare of the general public, the promotion of commercial and economic development, the attraction to our state of appropriate business, industrial, and tourist trade, resources, and investment, the development of an attractive environment that fosters the social welfare and health of the public.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> It is further declared that the developmental tools presently available to municipalities in the state do not contain sufficient flexibility to address the unique problems arising from the projects and to govern comprehensive and coordinated development of areas subject to these projects consistently with the previously-declared public needs and purposes. Proper development of these areas, consistent with the general welfare, may require designation of special land-use districts and special land-use controls, which may be more stringent or more flexible than existing zoning, planning, and other developmental tools, and the adoption, implementation, and administration of a plan that establishes a framework for development including detailed design and development criteria, regulations, and enforcement procedures.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> It is further declared that the most efficient and effective method to further the previously declared public policy of the state to encourage the appropriate, comprehensive, and coordinated development of these properties is to permit the creation of special economic development districts in the municipalities of the state and the creation of special economic development district commissions to adopt, implement, and administer plans of development that establish and enforce design and development criteria and regulations for the development of these areas.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> A special economic development district commission shall adopt a plan of development. Any plan of development adopted by a special economic development district commission pursuant to this chapter may regulate and restrict, by means of regulations duly adopted by the commission, the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, or use of buildings, structures, or land within the special economic development district in a uniform, consistent, and nondiscriminatory manner that is rationally related to the purposes of this chapter. The plan may include regulations relating to allowable land uses; the location and use of buildings; street systems; dimensional, height, and area coverage requirements; setbacks and build-to lines; frontage; parking requirements; landscaping; pedestrian travel; signs; design review; open spaces; and population density.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Pursuant to the plan of development, the commission may divide the special economic development district into several parcels as indicated on a development map, and may regulate structures and uses differently in different parcels, so long as regulation of similar structures and uses is uniform within any one parcel.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> A plan of development may be adopted or amended only after a public hearing before the commission, at which all interested parties have an opportunity to be heard. Notice of the time, place, nature, and purpose of the public hearing shall be given to all owners of real property within the bounds of the special economic development district and within two hundred feet (200´) of the perimeter thereof, by registered or certified mail at least seven (7) days before the date of the hearing, and by publication of notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the municipality at least once each week for three (3) successive weeks prior to the date of the hearing.</p>

It is the duty of the commission to review the application, plans, and specifications, and no building permit shall be granted until the commission has acted on it. No construction or other alteration of a structure may be undertaken within a special development district without a permit. The commission may, by regulation, coordinate permit approvals with state building officials and fire marshals, city or town officials, or duly qualified independent staff or consultants.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Nothing in this chapter prevents, or is to be construed to prevent, ordinary maintenance or repair of any structure within the special economic development district; nor shall anything in this chapter prevent, or be construed to prevent, the continuance of the use of any building or improvement for any purpose to which the building or improvement was lawfully devoted at the time of the adoption of a plan of development, or to prevent or be construed to prevent the erection, construction, alteration, repair, or demolition of any structure under a permit issued by the inspector of buildings prior to the adoption of a plan of development pursuant to this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> At all meetings of the commission, a majority of the commissioners is necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the commissioners present at any meeting at which there is a quorum is the act of the commission, except as otherwise provided by law.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by a decision of the commission may appeal to the superior court for the county in which the special economic development district is situated by filing a complaint stating the reasons of appeal within twenty (20) days after the decision has been filed in the office of the commission. The commission shall file the original documents acted upon by it and constituting the record of the hearing appealed from, or certified copies of the documents, together with any other facts that may be pertinent, with the clerk of the court within ten (10) days after being served with a copy of the complaint. When the complaint is filed by someone other than the original applicant or appellant, the original applicant or appellant and the members of the commission shall be made parties to the proceedings. The appeal shall not stay proceedings upon the decision being appealed, but the court may, in its discretion, grant a stay on appropriate terms and make any other orders that it deems necessary for an equitable disposition of the appeal.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> If, before the date set for hearing in the superior court, an application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence before the commission, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for the failure to present it at the hearing before the commission, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the commission upon conditions determined by the court. The commission may modify its findings and decision by reason of the additional evidence and file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the superior court.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The review shall be conducted by the superior court without a jury. The court shall consider the record of the hearing before the commission, and if it appears to the court that additional evidence is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may allow any party to the appeal to present evidence in open court, which evidence, along with the record shall constitute the record upon which the determination of the court is made.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.

The contract may further provide that in the case of a conveyance, the federal government may complete, operate, manage, lease, convey, or otherwise deal with the project in accordance with the terms of the contract; provided, that the contract requires that, as soon as practicable after the federal government is satisfied that all defaults with respect to the project have been cured and that the project will be operated in accordance with the terms of the contract, the federal government shall reconvey to the authority the project as then constituted. It is the purpose and intent of chapters 25 — 27 of this title to authorize every authority to do any and all things necessary to secure the financial aid and the cooperation of the federal government in the undertaking, construction, maintenance, and operation of any housing project which the authority is empowered to undertake.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> If, for any of the purposes of this chapter, an agency shall find it necessary to acquire any real property, whether for immediate or future use, the agency may find and determine that the property, whether a fee simple absolute or a lesser interest, is required for the acquisition, construction, or operation of a project, and upon that determination, the property shall be deemed to be required for public use until otherwise determined by the agency; and with the exceptions hereinafter specifically noted, the determination shall not be affected by the fact that the property has been taken for, or is then devoted to, a public use; but the public use in the hands or under the control of the agency shall be deemed superior to the public use in the hands of any other person, association, or corporation; provided further, however, that no real property or interest, estate, or right in these belonging to the state shall be acquired without consent of the state; and no real property or interest, estate, or right in these belonging to any municipality shall be acquired without the consent of the municipality; and no real property, or interest or estate in these, belonging to a public utility corporation may be acquired without the approval of the public utility commission or another regulatory body having regulatory power over the agency.</p>

Within six (6) months after its passage, the agency shall cause to be filed in the appropriate land evidence records a copy of its vote together with a statement signed by the chairperson or vice-chairperson of the agency that the property is taken pursuant to this chapter, and also a description of the real property indicating the nature and extent of the estate or interest in the estate taken and a plat of the real property, which copy of the vote and statement of the chairperson or vice-chairperson shall be certified by the secretary of the agency and the description and plat shall be certified by the city or town clerk for the city or town within which the real property lies.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> Forthwith thereafter the agency shall cause to be filed, in the superior court in and for the county within which the real property lies, a statement of the sum of money estimated to be just compensation for the property taken, and shall deposit in the superior court to the use of the persons entitled to the money the sum set forth in the statement. The agency shall satisfy the court that the amount deposited with the court is sufficient to satisfy the just claims of all persons having an estate or interest in the real property. Whenever the agency satisfies the court that the claims of all persons interested in the real property taken have been satisfied, the unexpended balance shall be ordered repaid forthwith to the agency.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> Upon the filing of the copy of the vote, statement, description, and plat in the land evidence records, and upon the making of the deposit in accordance with the order of the superior court, title to the real property in fee simple absolute or any lesser estate or interest specified in the resolution shall vest in the agency, and that real property shall be deemed to be condemned and taken for the use of the agency and the right to just compensation for the condemned property shall vest in the persons entitled to compensation, and the agency thereupon may take possession of the real property. No sum paid unto the court shall be charged with clerks’ fees of any nature.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(j)</b> After the filing of the copy of the vote, statement, description, and plat, notice of the taking of that land or other real property shall be served upon the owners of, or persons having any estate or interest in, the real property by the sheriff, or his or her deputies, of the county in which the real estate is situated by leaving a true and attested copy of the vote, statement, description, and plat with each of those persons personally, or at the last and usual place of abode in this state with some person living there, and in case any of those persons are absent from this state and have no last and usual place of abode therein occupied by any person, the copy shall be left with the person or persons, if any, in charge of, or having possession of, the real property taken of the absent persons, and another copy shall be mailed to the address of the person, if the address is known to the officer serving the notice.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(k)</b> After the filing of the vote, description, and plat, the agency shall cause a copy to be published in some newspaper having general circulation in the city or town in which the real property lies at least once a week for three (3) successive weeks.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(l)</b> If any party shall agree with the agency upon the price to be paid for the value of the real property so taken and of appurtenant damage to any remainder or for the value of his or her estate, right, or interest therein, the court, upon application of the parties in interest, may order that the sum agreed upon be paid forthwith from the money deposited, as the just compensation to be awarded in the proceedings.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(m)</b> Any owner of, or person entitled to any estate or right in, or interested in any part of, the real property taken, who cannot agree with the agency upon the price to be paid for his or her estate, right, or interest in the real property taken and the appurtenant damage to the remainder, may, within three (3) months after personal notice of the taking, or if he or she has no personal notice, may, within one year from the time the sum of money estimated to be just compensation is deposited in the superior court to the use of the persons entitled to the compensation, apply by petition to the superior court for the county in which the real property is situated, setting forth the taking of his or her land or his or her estate or interest in these and praying for an assessment of damages by the court or by a jury. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall cause twenty (20) days’ notice of the filing of the petition to be given to the agency by serving the chairperson or vice chairperson of the agency with a certified copy of the notice.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(n)</b> After the service of notice, the court may proceed to the trial thereof. The trial shall be conducted as other civil actions at law are tried. The trial shall determine all questions of fact relating to the value of the real property, and any estate or interest, and the amount of this value and the appurtenant damage to any remainder and the amount of this damage, and the trial and decision or verdict of the court or jury shall be subject to all rights to except to rulings, to move for new trial, and to appeal, as are provided by law. Upon the entry of judgment in those proceedings, execution shall be issued against the money deposited in court and in default against any other property of the agency. Pre-judgment interest and post-judgment interest, notwithstanding § 9-21-10, shall be computed in accordance with either the methodology set forth in § 37-6-23 or § 9-21-10, whichever produces the lower interest cost. The interest shall be paid by the agency out of any funds appropriated and available therefor.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(o)</b> In case two (2) or more petitioners make claim to the same real property, or to any estate or interest, or to different estate or interests in the same real property, the court shall, upon motion, consolidate their several petitions for trial at the same time, and may frame all necessary issues for the trial.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(p)</b> If any real property or any estate or interest, in which any minor or other person not capable in law to act in his or her own behalf is interested, is taken under the provisions of this chapter, the superior court, upon the filing of a petition by or in behalf of the minor or person or by the agency, may appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor or other person. Guardians may, with the advice and consent of the superior court, and upon any terms as the superior court may prescribe, release to the agency all claims for damages for the land of the minor or other person or for any estate or interest. Any lawfully appointed, qualified, and acting guardian or other fiduciary of the estate of any minor or other person, with the approval of the court of probate within this state having jurisdiction to authorize the sale of lands and properties within this state of the minor or other person, may before the filing of any petition, agree with the minor or other person for any taking of his or her real property or of his or her interest or estate, and may, upon receiving the amount, release to the agency all claims for damages for the minor or other person for the taking.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(q)</b> In case any owner of, or any person having an estate or interest in, the real property fails to file his or her petition, the superior court for the county in which the real property is situated, in its discretion, may permit the filing of the petition within one year subsequent to the year following the time of the deposit in the superior court of the sum of money estimated to be just compensation for the property taken; provided, the person shall have had no actual knowledge of the taking of the land in season to file the petition; and provided, no other person or persons claiming to own the real property or estate or interest shall have been paid the value; and provided, no judgment has been rendered against the agency for the payment of the value to any other person or persons claiming to own the real estate.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(r)</b> If any real property or any estate or interest is unclaimed or held by a person or persons whose whereabouts are unknown, after making inquiry satisfactory to the superior court for the county in which the real property lies, the agency, after the expiration of two (2) years from the first publication of the copy of the vote, statement, description, and plat, may petition the court that the value of the estate or interest of the unknown person or persons be determined. After the notice by publication to any person or persons that the court in its discretion may order, and after a hearing on the petition, the court shall fix the value of the estate or interest and shall order the sum to be deposited in the registry of the court in a special account to accumulate for the benefit of the person or persons, if any, entitled to it. The receipt of the clerk of the superior court shall constitute a discharge of the agency from all liability in connection with the taking. When the person entitled to the money deposited shall have satisfied the superior court of his or her right to receive that money, the court shall cause it to be paid over to him or her, with all accumulations thereon.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(s)</b> The superior court shall have power to make any orders with respect to encumbrances, liens, taxes, and other charges on the land, if any, as shall be just and equitable.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The state, acting by and through the department of revenue, is authorized to enter into an economic activity taxes agreement with the agency and the city for the purposes of financing projects, bonding costs, including capitalized interest, debt service reserves, and costs of issuance. Such economic activity taxes agreement may include such covenants and undertakings of the state as the state director of the department of revenue and the governor deem reasonable, including, without limitation, provisions enabling the payment of amounts under the economic activity taxes agreement from legally available funds for each fiscal year during which any bonds are outstanding.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Such economic activity taxes agreement and the pledge and assignment of the state economic activity taxes shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter rather than the provisions of chapter 64.21 of title 42. Upon the execution of an economic activity taxes agreement, such economic activity taxes shall be segregated by the state division of taxation from all other tax revenues of the state and deposited on a monthly basis into a restricted account known as the “downtown Pawtucket redevelopment economic activity taxes fund.” However, in the event an economic activity taxes agreement has not been signed by June 30, 2020, incremental tax revenues realized in the arts district, the growth center district, and the ballpark district assessed and collected under chapters 18 and 19 of title 44 shall be segregated by the state division of taxation and deposited into the downtown Pawtucket redevelopment economic activity taxes fund. Monies deposited in the downtown Pawtucket redevelopment economic activity taxes fund may be applied to payment of debt service on the bonds; to fund debt service reserves; to costs of infrastructure improvements in and around the ballpark district, arts district, and the growth center district; to fund future debt service on the bonds; and to fund a redevelopment revolving fund established in accordance with § 45-33-1. If economic activity taxes remain in such downtown Pawtucket redevelopment economic activity taxes fund at the end of the state’s fiscal year, the monies shall be retained in the fund to be applied in future fiscal years and shall not be applied to reduce future payments but may be applied to “super sinker,” “turbo,” or other redemption of the bonds, such that if the agency receives revenues in excess of requirements in the bond indenture or trust agreement securing the bonds, the bonds may be retired. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the pooling of revenues for the payment of the bonds, provided that the economic activity taxes agreement, bond indenture, or trust agreement shall provide for a reconciliation of contributions of the agency, the city, and the state from time to time; provided however, that the state hereby pledges to and agrees with any person, firm, or corporation, or federal agency subscribing to or acquiring any bonds secured by revenues under this chapter, that the state will not limit or alter the rights vested in the city or the agency or such bondholders until all bonds at any time issued, together with their interest, are fully met and discharged. The state does further pledge to and agree with the United States, and any other federal agency, that in the event that any federal agency constructs or contributes any funds for the construction, extension, improvement, equipping, furnishing, or enlargement of any project, or any portion of it, the state will not alter or limit this chapter in any manner that would be inconsistent with the due performance of any agreements with the federal agency; and the city and the agency continue to have and may exercise all powers granted by this chapter, so long as the powers are necessary or desirable for the carrying out of the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The economic activity taxes agreement shall not constitute indebtedness of the state or any of its subdivisions, or a debt for which the full faith and credit of the state or any of its subdivisions is pledged. The state’s obligation to make payments of state economic activity taxes under the state economic activity taxes agreement shall be solely from legally available funds.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The economic activity taxes agreement may be terminated upon agreement of the parties thereto, provided, however, the economic activity taxes agreement shall not be terminated so long as any bonds secured by the economic activity taxes remain outstanding.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> By no later than September 30, 2019, the state department of revenue shall establish the baseline to be used in the calculation of state revenues in the state economic activity tax agreement. By that date, the department of revenue, in consultation with the state commerce corporation shall develop a template of an economic activity tax agreement to be executed between the city, the agency, and the state at such time that a redevelopment project is submitted for consideration. Upon submission of a redevelopment project by the city or the agency for financing under this statute, the state shall complete negotiations and finalize approval of an economic activity agreement within 120 days of the submission of the request for financing.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Not later than February 1 of each year commencing February 1, 2022, the city, the agency, and the Rhode Island commerce corporation shall submit a performance review report to the general assembly which includes, but is not limited to, the following information: sources and uses of project funds, permanent job and construction job creation numbers, local and state tax revenue estimates, and project completion schedules.</p>

It is further declared that the acquisition of title to those facilities and the lease or sale of those facilities, as provided under this chapter, is a public purpose and shall be regarded as performing an essential governmental function in carrying out the provisions of this chapter. However, competition between communities in this state merely for the purpose of seeking relocation of industrial facilities located in this state is contrary to the policy of this chapter.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The corporation is authorized to issue its negotiable revenue bonds and notes from time to time for any of its corporate purposes. All bonds and notes issued by the corporation are payable solely out of the revenues and receipts derived from the leasing or sale by the corporation of its projects or of any thereof, or from any other financing arrangement with respect thereto, as may be designated in the proceedings of the corporation under which the bonds or notes are authorized to be issued. The bonds and notes may be executed and delivered by the corporation at any time and, from time to time, may be in a form and denominations and of a tenor and maturities, may be in bearer form or in registered form, as to principal and interest or as to principal alone, may be payable in installments and at a time or times may be payable at places whether within or without the state, may bear interest at a rate or rates payable at a time or times and at a place or places and evidenced in a manner, and may contain provisions not inconsistent herewith, all as are provided in the proceedings of the corporation under which the bonds are authorized to be issued; provided, however, that bonds of the corporation are payable not more than forty (40) years from their date of issue and notes are payable not more than ten (10) years from their date of issue. If deemed advisable by the corporation, there may be retained in the proceedings, under which any bonds or notes of the corporation are authorized to be issued, an option to redeem all or any part of the bonds or notes as may be specified in the proceedings, at a price or prices and after notice or notices and on terms and conditions as may be stated in the proceedings and as may be recited on the face of the bonds or notes, but nothing herein contained shall be construed to confer on the corporation any right or option to redeem any bonds or notes, except as may be provided in the proceedings under which they are issued. Any bonds or notes of the corporation may be sold at a price or prices, at public or private sale, in a manner and, from time to time, as may be determined by the corporation, and the corporation may pay all expenses, premiums, and commissions which it may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with their issuance and sale. Any moneys of the corporation, including proceeds from the sale of any bonds or notes, and revenues, receipts, and income from any of its projects, may be invested and reinvested in obligations, securities, and other investments that are provided in the resolution or resolutions under which the bonds or notes are authorized.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Issuance by the corporation of one or more series of bonds or notes for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds or notes in connection with the same project or any other projects, but the proceedings, whereunder any subsequent bonds or notes may be issued, shall recognize and protect any prior pledge or mortgage made for any prior issue of bonds or notes, unless in the proceedings authorizing the prior issue, the right is reserved to issue subsequent bonds or notes on a parity with the prior issue.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Without limiting the generality of the preceding, the corporation may issue its bonds or notes to finance any industrial facilities which may have been initiated by the Rhode Island industrial facilities corporation prior to February 27, 1967, and without regard to the stage of completion of any of the industrial facilities.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The corporation is authorized to provide for the issuance of its revenue bonds or notes for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds or notes of the corporation then outstanding, including the payment of any redemption premium on the bonds or notes and any interest accrued or to accrue to the earliest or subsequent date of redemption, purchase, or maturity of the revenue bonds or notes, and, if deemed advisable by the corporation, for the additional purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of constructing and acquiring additions, improvements, extensions, or enlargements of a project or any portion of it.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The proceeds of the revenue bonds or notes issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding revenue bonds or notes may, in the discretion of the corporation, be applied to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of the outstanding revenue bonds or notes either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date, and may, pending the application, be placed in escrow to be applied to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on a date that may be determined by the corporation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The escrowed proceeds, pending that use, may be invested and reinvested in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, or in certificates of deposit or time deposits secured by direct obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, maturing at an appropriate time or times to assure the prompt payment, as to principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, on the outstanding revenue bonds or notes to be refunded. The interest, income, and profits, if any, earned or realized on any investment may also be applied to the payment of the outstanding revenue bonds or notes to be refunded. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied and carried out, any balance of the proceeds and interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on the investments, may be returned to the corporation for use by it in any lawful manner. The portion of the proceeds of any revenue bonds or notes issued for the additional purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of constructing and acquiring additions, improvements, extensions, or enlargements of a project may be invested and reinvested in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, or in certificates of deposit or time deposits secured by direct obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, maturing not later than the time or times when proceeds will be needed for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost. The interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on the investments may be applied to the payment of all or any part of that cost or may be used by the corporation in any lawful manner.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> All the revenue bonds or notes shall be issued and secured and shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter in the same manner and to the same extent as any other revenue bonds and notes issued pursuant to this chapter. All revenue bonds and notes authorized under this section and the interest coupons if any, applicable thereto, are hereby made and shall be construed to be negotiable instruments.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> Money borrowed by the corporation for the purpose of providing temporary financing of a project or projects or combination of projects pending the issuance of bonds or other notes shall be evidenced by notes or other obligations. The principal and interest of all notes or other obligations of the corporation so issued under the provisions of this section are payable from the following:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> From the proceeds of bonds subsequently issued; or</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> From the proceeds of subsequent borrowings which comply with the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, all of these notes are deemed to be negotiable instruments under the laws of the state subject only to the provisions for registration contained therein.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The principal of and interest on any bonds or notes issued by the corporation may be secured by a pledge of any revenues and receipts of the corporation and may be secured by a mortgage or deed of trust or trust indenture covering all or any part of a project, including any additions, improvements, extensions to or enlargements of any projects thereafter made. The bonds or notes may also be secured by an assignment of the lease or other financing agreement, with respect to any project for the construction and acquisition of which the bonds or notes are issued, and by an assignment of the revenues and receipts derived by the corporation from the lease or other financing agreement. The resolution under which the bonds or notes are authorized to be issued and the mortgage, deed of trust, trust indenture, lease, or other financing agreement may contain agreements and provisions respecting the maintenance of the projects covered by them, the fixing and collection of rents or other revenues for any portions of them leased or sold by the corporation to others, the creation and maintenance of special funds from those revenues, and the rights and remedies available in the event of default, all as the corporation deems advisable and not in conflict with the provisions hereof. Each pledge, agreement, mortgage, deed of trust, and trust indenture made for the benefit or security of any of the bonds or notes of the corporation are valid and binding from the time the pledge is made, and shall continue to be in effect until the principal of and interest on the bonds or notes for the benefit of which the bonds or notes were made have been fully paid, or until provision has been made for payment in the manner provided in the resolution or resolutions under which the bonds or notes may be authorized. The revenues, moneys, or property pledged by the corporation are immediately subject to the lien of a pledge without any physical delivery or further act, and the lien of the pledge is valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the corporation, irrespective of whether the parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. In the event of a default in the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds or notes or in any agreements of the corporation made as a part of the contract under which the bonds or notes are issued, whether contained in the proceedings authorizing the bonds or notes or in any instrument executed as security for them, the rights of affected bondholders or noteholders may be enforced by mandamus, the appointment of a receiver in equity, or by foreclosure of the mortgage, deed of trust, or other instrument, or any one or more of those remedies or any other remedy provided in the proceedings.</p>

<p class="p6">The general assembly finds that excessive quantities of soil are eroding from certain areas of the state that are undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses as housing developments, industrial areas, recreational facilities, commercial facilities, and roads. Erosion occurring in these areas makes necessary costly repairs to gullies, washed out fills, roads, and embankments. The resulting sediment clogs storm sewers and road ditches, roils streams, and deposits silt in ponds and reservoirs. In some of the state’s waters, silt resulting from erosion has become a major water pollutant and threatens water supply, recreational, aesthetic, and wildlife habitat values associated with these waters. The general assembly finds that certain agricultural lands also experience extensive erosion and sedimentation. The general assembly directs the department of environmental management division of agriculture and the Rhode Island state conservation committee to work with landowners on these lands to implement conservation plans and/or activities.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a) (1)</b> It is unlawful for any person to disturb any existing vegetation, grades, and contours of land in a manner which may increase the potential for soil erosion, without first applying for a determination of applicability from the building official or his or her designee. Upon determination of applicability, the owner/applicant shall submit a soil erosion and sediment control plan for approval by the building official or his or her designee, as provided in article IV. The application for determination of applicability shall describe the location, nature, character, and time schedule of the proposed land disturbing activity in sufficient detail to allow the building official or his or her designee to determine the potential for soil erosion and sedimentation resulting from the proposed project. In determining the applicability of the soil erosion and sediment control ordinance to a particular land disturbing activity, the building official or his or her designee shall consider site topography, drainage patterns, soils, proximity to watercourses, and other information deemed appropriate by the building official or his or her designee. A particular land disturbing activity shall not be subject to the requirements of this ordinance if the building official or his or her designee finds that erosion resulting from the land disturbing activity is insignificant and represents no threat to adjacent properties or to the quality of any coastal feature or watercourse, as defined in Article IX. The current “Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook,” U.S. department of agriculture soil conservation service, R.I. department of environmental management, and R.I. state conservation committee shall be consulted in making this determination.</p>

<p class="p6">There is created a lien in favor of any taking jurisdiction in this state on the proceeds of any insurance policy based upon a claim made for damage or loss to a building or other structure caused by or arising out of any fire or explosion. The lien arises upon any unpaid tax, special ad valorem levy, special assessment, or other charge imposed upon real property by or on behalf of the state, a municipal corporation, or a special district which is an encumbrance on real property, whether or not evidenced by written instrument, that has remained undischarged for at least one year prior to the filing of a proof of loss. The lien also arises as a result of any costs incurred by a municipal corporation to secure, demolish, or render an unsafe building or structure or part of the structure safe, in accordance with chapter 27.3 of title 23.</p>

In the event that the Nasonville district is furnished with water through the extension of an existing water system not within the district, the extension to the Nasonville district shall not cause the existing water system to be deemed a public utility if, prior to the extension, the system had not been a public utility as defined in § 39-1-2(20). Nor shall Nasonville district be deemed a public utility pursuant to that section if it supplies water to homes outside of the district where the groundwater is, or reasonably may be expected to become, contaminated in a manner that would render it unfit for consumption.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The necessity for the acquisition of property under this act shall be conclusively presumed upon the adoption by the district of a vote determining that the acquisition of property or any interest in property described in its vote is necessary for the acquisition, construction or operation of a water supply facility. Within six (6) months after its passage, the district shall cause to be filed in the appropriate land evidence records a copy of its vote together with a statement signed by the chairperson or treasurer of the district that the property is taken pursuant to this act, and also a description of real property indicating the nature and extent of the estate or interest therein taken as aforesaid and a plat thereof, a copy of the vote and statement of the chairperson or treasurer shall be certified by the secretary of the district and the description and plat shall be certified by the city or town clerk for the city or town where the real property lies.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(n)</b> In case any owner of or any person having an estate or interest in real property shall fail to file his or her petition as above provided, the superior court for the county in which the real property is situated, in its discretion, may permit the filing of a petition within one year subsequent to the year following the time of the deposit in the superior court of the sum of money estimated to be just compensation for the property taken; provided, the person shall have had no actual knowledge of the taking of land in season to file the petition; and provided, no other person or persons claiming to own the real property or estate or interest therein shall have been paid the value thereof; and provided, no judgment had been rendered against the district for the payment of the value to any other person or persons claiming to own the real estate.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(o)</b> In any real property or any estate or interest therein is unclaimed or held by a person or persons whose whereabouts are unknown, after making inquiry satisfactory to the superior court for the county in which the real property lies, the district, after the expiration of two (2) years from the first publication of the copy of the vote, statement and description, may petition the court that the value of the estate or interest or the unknown person or persons be determined. After notice by publication to the person or persons as the court in its discretion may order, and after hearing on the petition, the court shall fix the value of the estate or interest and shall order the sum to be deposited in the registry of the court in a special account to accumulate for the benefit of the person or persons, if any, entitled thereto. The receipt of the clerk of the superior court shall constitute a discharge of the district from all liability in connection with the taking. When the person entitled to the money deposited shall have satisfied the superior court of his or her right to receive the same, the court shall cause it to be paid over to him or her, with all accumulations thereon.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(p)</b> The superior court shall have power to make orders with respect to encumbrances, liens, taxes and other charges on the land, if any, as shall be just and equitable.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(q)</b> Whenever in the opinion of the district a substantial saving in the cost of acquiring title can be effected by conveying other real property, title to which is in the district, to the person or persons from whom the estate or interest in real property is being purchased or taken, or by the construction or improvement by the district of any work or facility upon the remaining real property of the person or persons from whom the estate or interest in real property is being purchased or taken, the district shall be and hereby is authorized to convey other real property to the person or persons from whom the estate or interest in real property is being purchased or taken and to construct or improve any work or facility upon the remaining land of the person or persons.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(r)</b> At any time during the pendency of any proceedings for the assessment of damages for property or interests taken or to be taken by eminent domain by the district, the district or any owner may apply to the court for an order directing an owner or the district, as the case may be, to show cause why further proceedings should not be expedited, and the court may upon the application make an order requiring that the hearings proceed and that any other steps be taken with all possible expedition.</p>

Bonds may be issued in bearer or in registered form, or both, and if notes, may be made payable to bearer or to order, as the district may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of bonds registered as to both principal and interest and for the interchange of bonds registered as to both principal and interest and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The issue of notes shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter relating to the issue of bonds in anticipation of bonds as may be applicable.

Any lawfully appointed, qualified, and acting guardian or other fiduciary of the estate of any minor or other person, with the approval of the court of probate within this state having jurisdiction to authorize the sale of lands and properties within this state of any minor or other person, may, before the filing of any petition, agree with the authority upon the amount of damages suffered by the minor or other person by any taking of his or her lands or of his or her interests in any lands, and may, upon receiving that amount, release to the authority all claims of damages of the minor or other person for the taking.</p>

Whenever the authority has satisfied the court that the claims of all persons interested in the land taken have been satisfied, the unexpended balance, including any interest or increment on any sums deposited, shall be paid immediately to the authority.</p>

Laws § 45-50-13(a)(2), the General Assembly empowered the Providence Public Building Authority (PPBA) to take land, including property owner’s easements, by eminent domain; furthermore, in creating public building authorities such as the PPBA, the legislature, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-50-2, chose to give them a legal existence apart from the city or town in which a particular authority operates. Root v. Providence Water Supply Bd., 850 A.2d 94, 2004 R.I.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The authority is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance, at one time, or from time to time, of revenue bonds of the authority for the purpose of paying all or a part of the cost of any one or more projects, the construction or acquisition of which is authorized by this chapter. The principal of and the interest on the bonds shall be payable from the funds provided for payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, bear interest at a rate or rates that the authority determines, payable from time to time, shall mature at a time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the authority, and may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at a price or prices and under terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The authority shall determine the form of bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached to them, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of the principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. The bonds shall be signed by the chairperson of the authority or a facsimile shall be impressed or imprinted on the bonds and attested by the manual or facsimile signature of the secretary of the authority, and any coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairperson of the authority. In case any officer, whose signature or facsimile of whose signatures appears on any bonds or coupons, ceases to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds, the signature or the facsimile is nevertheless valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he or she had remained in office until the delivery. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone, and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered and coupon bonds. The authority may sell bonds in a manner, either at public or private sale, and for a price that it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used for the payment of the cost of the project or projects for which the bonds have been issued, and shall be disbursed in a manner and under restrictions, if any, that the authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates, are less than the cost, additional bonds may in the same manner be issued to provide the amount of the deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds, are deemed to be of the same issue and are entitled to payment from the same fund without preference of priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue exceed the cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for the bonds, or may be applied to the payment of the cost of any project financed under the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when definitive bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which become mutilated or are destroyed or lost. Bonds, other than school housing bonds pursuant to chapter 7 of title 16, may be issued under the provisions of this chapter without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of the state, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions, or things, than those proceedings, conditions, or things which are specifically required by this chapter. All bonds, notes and other forms of indebtedness, other than interim finance mechanisms, issued in support of school housing projects shall require passage of an enabling act by the general assembly.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> However, in no event shall the authority borrow in principal amount for any one bond issue more than fifteen percent (15%) of the total of the most recent adopted municipal budget. In addition, the total outstanding principal amount of bonds of the authority shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the most recent adopted municipal budget; provided, however, that there shall not be included in the calculation of this limitation fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding principal amount of any bonds issued for projects for which the authority or the municipality receives school housing aid pursuant to §§ 16-7-44 and 16-7-41.</p>

<p class="p6">In the discretion of the authority, any bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. The trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received, and may convey or mortgage or grant a security interest in any project or any part of it or any combination of projects or parts of them. The trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders or noteholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants stating the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation, and insurance of the project or projects in connection with which the bonds have been authorized, the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, and conditions or limitations with respect to the issuance of additional bonds. It is lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish indemnifying bonds or to pledge securities as may be required by the authority. Any trust agreement may state the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the preceding, any trust agreement or resolution may contain any other provisions that the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of the trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the authority’s cost of operation and maintenance.</p>

It is further declared to be the purpose of this chapter to provide for housing opportunities for low and moderate income individuals and families in each city and town of the state and that an equal consideration shall be given to the retrofitting and rehabilitation of existing dwellings for low and moderate income housing and assimilating low and moderate income housing into existing and future developments and neighborhoods.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The state housing appeals board shall have the powers to: (i) adopt, amend and repeal rules and regulations that are consistent with this chapter and are necessary to implement the requirements of §§ 45-53-5, 45-53-6, and 45-53-7; (ii) receive and expend state appropriations; and (iii) establish a reasonable fee schedule, which may be waived, to carry out its duties.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> In hearing the appeal, the state housing appeals board shall determine whether: (i) in the case of the denial of an application, the decision of the local review board was consistent with an approved affordable housing plan, or if the town does not have an approved affordable housing plan, was reasonable and consistent with local needs; and (ii) in the case of an approval of an application with conditions and requirements imposed, whether those conditions and requirements make the construction or operation of the housing infeasible and whether those conditions and requirements are consistent with an approved affordable housing plan, or if the town does not have an approved affordable housing plan, are consistent with local needs.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> In making a determination, the standards for reviewing the appeal include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The consistency of the decision to deny or condition the permit with the approved affordable housing plan and/or approved comprehensive plan;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The extent to which the community meets or plans to meet housing needs, as defined in an affordable housing plan, including, but not limited to, the ten percent (10%) goal for existing low and moderate income housing units as a proportion of year-round housing;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The consideration of the health and safety of existing residents;</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> If the appeals board finds, in the case of a denial, that the decision of the local review board was not consistent with an approved affordable housing plan, or if the town does not have an approved affordable housing plan, was not reasonable and consistent with local needs, it shall vacate the decision and issue a decision and order approving the application, denying the application, or approving with various conditions consistent with local needs. If the appeals board finds, in the case of an approval with conditions and requirements imposed, that the decision of the local review board makes the building or operation of the housing infeasible, and/or the conditions and requirements are not consistent with an approved affordable housing plan, or if the town does not have an approved affordable housing plan, are not consistent with local needs, it shall issue a decision and order, modifying or removing any condition or requirement so as to make the proposal no longer infeasible and/or consistent, and approving the application; provided, that the appeals board shall not issue any decision and order that would permit the building or operation of the housing in accordance with standards less safe than the applicable building and site plan requirements of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Rhode Island housing and mortgage finance corporation, whichever agency is financially assisting the housing. Decisions or conditions and requirements imposed by a local review board that are consistent with approved affordable housing plans and/or with local needs shall not be vacated, modified, or removed by the appeals board notwithstanding that the decision or conditions and requirements have the effect of denying or making the applicant’s proposal infeasible.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The appeals board or the applicant has the power to enforce the orders of the appeals board by an action brought in the superior court. The local review board shall carry out the decision and order of the appeals board within thirty (30) days of its entry and, upon failure to do so, the decision and order of the appeals board is, for all purposes, deemed to be the action of the local review board, unless the applicant consents to a different decision or order by the local review board. The decision and order of the appeals board is binding on the city or town, which shall immediately issue any and all necessary permits and approvals to allow the construction and operation of the housing as approved by the appeals board.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>Constitutionality.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State Housing Appeals Board’s required standard of review of a denial of an application to develop affordable housing, which under R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 45-53-6 and 45-53-3 was more stringent when a municipality had failed to reach its statutory quota of affordable housing, did not violate equal protection or substantive due process. The state had a legitimate interest in addressing the housing needs of its poorer citizens, and the court could not say that the Low and Moderate Income Housing Act was unrelated to the health, safety, or welfare of the individuals and families whom the General Assembly sought to affect through its enactment. E. Bay Cmty. Dev. Corp. v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 901 A.2d 1136, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 137 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-53-6(c), the State Housing Appeals Board could not vacate, modify, or reverse a decision or remove any conditions attached to a conditional approval of a low-income housing project that were consistent with local needs, even though the conditions might make the project infeasible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Board failed to make specific findings, failed to take into account existing subdivision regulations, and failed to use the correct standard of review found in R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-53-6(a). Town of Coventry Zoning Bd. of Review v. Omni Dev. Corp., 814 A.2d 889, 2003 R.I. LEXIS 31 (R.I. 2003).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Denial of Application.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State Housing Appeals Board (SHAB), in applying analyses required by R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 45-53-6 and 45-53-3(2) when reviewing a denial of an application to develop affordable housing, did not violate a town’s procedural due process rights, given the clear and unambiguous language of the statutes and the Rhode Island Supreme Court’s amplification of SHAB’s analytical responsibilities five months before an application for a low-income-housing permit was filed. The town’s contention that it was somehow prohibited from having an adequate opportunity to research applicable case law fell far short of a due process violation. E. Bay Cmty. Dev. Corp. v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 901 A.2d 1136, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 137 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Factors for Review.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Because the developer sold the property to a limited liability company of which the developer was the controlling member prior to the effective date of R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-53-6(f)(1), the State Housing Appeals Board properly dismissed for lack of standing the developer’s appeal of a town zoning board decision denying the developer’s application for a comprehensive permit to develop low and moderate income housing. Cortellesso v. Town of Smithfield Zoning Bd. of Review, 888 A.2d 979, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 198 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Since the record was replete with evidence that the developer’s proposal would not fit harmoniously within the surrounding neighborhood, and the State Housing Appeals Board (SHAB) weighed the evidence in light of other considerations set forth in R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 45-53-3(2) and 45-53-6(c), such as the need for low and moderate income housing, the number of low income residents, and the extent to which the community met its housing needs, SHAB did not err when it found that the zoning board’s decision was consistent with the town’s comprehensive plan. Hous. Opportunities Corp. v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 890 A.2d 445, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 4 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State Housing Appeals Board properly found that a zoning board’s denial of an application to develop affordable housing was not consistent with local needs. Based on its reasoned findings, the board concluded that the development would not have a negative impact on traffic safety, did not exhibit fire risks that could not be adequately addressed at the building permit stage, and was not excessively dense, and that the zoning board had unreasonably found otherwise. E. Bay Cmty. Dev. Corp. v. Zoning Bd. of Review, 901 A.2d 1136, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 137 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><b>Substantially Complete.</b></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Although R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-53-6(f)(1) delineates alternative standards for the State Housing Appeals Board to deem a comprehensive permit application substantially complete, the Board’s finding that the statute was inapplicable was not clearly erroneous; thus, the Board’s finding that a company’s application was not substantially complete as of February 13, 2004, was affirmed. W. Reservoir, LLC v. Town of Smithfield Zoning Bd. of Review, 884 A.2d 977, 2005 R.I. LEXIS 197 (R.I. 2005).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-53-5 does not provide for a direct appeal from an adverse substantial completeness determination made by the Rhode Island State Housing Appeals Board pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-53-6(f)(1); however, pursuant to R.I. Const. art. 10, § 2, relief may be sought in the Rhode Island Supreme Court by way of a writ of certiorari. New Harbor Vill., LLC v. Town of New Shoreham Zoning Bd. of Review, 894 A.2d 901, 2006 R.I. LEXIS 39 (R.I. 2006).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State Housing Appeals Board made an error of law in determining that a developer’s comprehensive permit application was substantially complete as of the moratorium date on such applications because the application contained no master plan in disregard of the plain language of R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-53-6(f)(1)(i)(H) and the Board, in erroneously finding that the Town of Smithfield’s zoning board treated the application as substantially complete, did not consider the statutory pressure the board was under to convene and continue to hold hearings to comply with the pre-moratorium version of R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-53-4. Town of Smithfield v. Churchill &amp; Banks Cos., LLC, 924 A.2d 796, 2007 R.I. LEXIS 82 (R.I. 2007).</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>State Housing Appeals Board’s definition of substantial completeness, “substantial” meaning material or important and “complete” meaning having all parts or elements, was misapplied by the Board in finding the developers’ comprehensive permit applications to be substantially complete, improperly focusing on sufficiency rather the substantial completeness; the applications were missing, waivers, time tables, and evidence of eligibility for a government subsidy.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The corporation has the right to acquire any land, or any interest in it, including development rights, by the exercise of the power of eminent domain, whenever it is determined by the corporation that the acquisition of the land, or interest, is necessary for the construction or the operation of any project.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The power of eminent domain shall be exercised only within the boundaries of the city or town whose council established the corporation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The necessity for acquisition is conclusively presumed upon the adoption by the corporation of a resolution declaring that the acquisition of the land, or interest in it, described in the resolution is necessary for the construction or operation of any project. Within six (6) months thereafter, the corporation shall cause to be filed, in the land evidence records of the city or town in which the land is located, a copy of the resolution of the corporation, together with a plat of the land, or interest in it described, and a statement signed by the chairperson of the corporation, that the land, or interest in it, is taken pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Thereupon, the corporation shall file, in the superior court in and for the county in which the land, or interest in it, lies, a statement of the sum of money estimated by the corporation to be just compensation for the land taken.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Upon filing of the copy of the resolution, plat, and statement in the land evidence records of the city or town, the filing, in the superior court, of the statement, and the depositing in the superior court, to the use of the person entitled to it, of such a sum as the court determines to be amply sufficient to satisfy the claims of all persons interested in the land (and the court may, in its discretion, take evidence on the question to determine the sum to be deposited), title to the land, or interest in it, shall vest in the corporation in fee simple absolute and the corporation thereupon may take possession of the land, or interest in it.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> No sum so paid into the court shall be charged with clerk’s fees of any nature. After the filing of the copy, plat, and statement, notice of the taking of the land, or interest in it, shall be served upon the owners of and persons having an estate in and interest in the land by the sheriff or the sheriff’s deputies of the county in which the land, or interest in it, lies, leaving a true and attested copy of the description and statement with each of the persons personally, or at their last and usual place of abode in this state with some person living there, and in case any of the persons are absent from this state and have no last and usual place of abode in this state occupied by any person, the copy shall be left with the persons, if any, in charge of or having possession of the land, or interest in it, taken of the absent persons if the persons are known to the officer; and after the filing of the resolution, plat, and statement, the secretary of the corporation shall cause a copy of the resolution and statement to be published in some newspaper published or having general circulation in the county where the land, or interest in it, may be located, at least once a week for three (3) successive weeks. If any persons agree with the corporation for the price of land, or interest in it, so taken, the court, upon the application of the parties in interest, may order that the sum agreed upon be paid immediately from the money deposited, as the just compensation to be awarded in the proceeding.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> Any owner of or person entitled to any estate in or interest in any part of the land, or interest in it, so taken, who cannot agree with the corporation for the price of the land, or interest in it, so taken, in which he or she is interested, may, within three (3) months after personal notice of the taking, or, if he or she has no personal notice, within one year from the first publication of the copy of the resolution and statement, apply, by petition, to the superior court in and for the county in which the land, or interest in it, lies, setting forth the taking of his or her land or interest in it, and praying for an assessment of damages by a jury. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall cause twenty (20)days’ notice of the pendency of the petition to be given to the corporation with a certified copy, and may proceed after the notice to the trial; and the trial shall determine all questions of fact relating to the value of the land, or interest in it, and the amount and judgment shall be entered upon the verdict of the jury and execution shall be issued against the money so deposited in court and in default against any other property of the corporation. In case two (2) or more conflicting petitioners make claim to the same land, or to any interests in it, or to different interests in the same parcel of land, the court, upon motion, shall consolidate their several petitions for trial at the same time by the same jury, and may frame all necessary issues for the trial; and all proceedings taken pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall take precedence over all other civil matters then pending before the court, or if the superior court, in and for the county in which the land, or interest in it, lies, is not in session in that county, then the proceedings may be heard in the superior court for the counties of Providence and Bristol.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> If any lands, or interests in them, in which any minor, or other person not capable in law to act in his or her own behalf, is interested are taken by the corporation under the provisions of this chapter, the superior court, upon the filing of any petition by or in behalf of the minor or other person, may appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor or other person, and the guardian may appear and be heard in behalf of the minor or other person, and the guardian may also, with the advice and consent of the superior court and upon those terms that the superior court may prescribe, release to the corporation all claims for damages for the lands of the minor or other persons, or for any interest in them. Any lawfully appointed, qualified, and acting guardian or other fiduciary of the estate of any minor or other person, with the approval of the court of probate within this state having jurisdiction to authorize the sale of lands and properties within this state of any minor or other person, may, before the filing of any petition, agree with the corporation upon the amount of damages suffered by the minor or other person by any taking of his or her lands or of his or her interests in any lands, and may, upon receiving that amount, release to the corporation all claims of damages of the minor or other person for the taking.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> Whenever, from time to time, the corporation has satisfied the court that the amount deposited with the court is greater than is amply sufficient to satisfy the claims of all persons interested in the land, the court may order that the amount of any excess, including any interest or increment on any sums so deposited, shall be repaid to the corporation. Whenever the corporation has satisfied the court that the claims of all persons interested in the land taken have been satisfied, the unexpended balance, including any interest or increment on any sums so deposited, shall immediately be paid to the corporation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(i)</b> In any proceedings for the assessment of compensation and damages for land or interest in it taken or to be taken by eminent domain by the corporation, the following provision is applicable: At any time during the pendency of any action or proceeding, the corporation or an owner may apply to the court for an order directing an owner or the corporation, as the case may be, to show cause why further proceedings should not be expedited, and the court may upon that application make an order requiring that the hearings proceed and that any other steps be taken with all possible expedition.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(j)</b> If any of the land, or interest therein, is devoted to a public use, it may be acquired, and the taking is effective, provided that no land, or interest in it, belonging to a public utilities administrator or other officer or tribunal having regulatory power over a public utility is taken. Any land, or interest in it, already acquired by the corporation may nevertheless be included within the taking for the purpose of acquiring any outstanding interests in the land.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The corporation is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance, at one time or from time to time, of revenue bonds of the corporation for the purpose of paying all or part of the cost of any one or more projects, the construction or acquisition of which is authorized by this chapter. The principal of and the interest on the bonds are payable from the funds provided for payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, bear interest at the rate or rates that the corporation determines, payable from time to time, shall mature at a time or times not exceeding fifty (50) years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the corporation, and may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of the corporation, at the price or prices and under terms and conditions that may be fixed by the corporation prior to the issuance of the bonds. The corporation shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached to them, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of the principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. The bonds shall be signed by the chairperson of the corporation, or a facsimile of the signature shall be impressed or imprinted on the bonds and attested by the manual or facsimile signature of the secretary of the corporation, and any coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairperson of the corporation. In case any officer whose signature, or the facsimile of whose signature, appears on any bonds or coupons ceases to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds, the signature or the facsimile is nevertheless valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if he or she had remained in office until the delivery. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the corporation may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and, also, as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered and coupon bonds. The corporation may sell bonds in a manner, either at public or private sale, and for a price, as it may determine will best effect the purpose of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used for the payment of the cost of the project or projects for which the bonds have been issued, and shall be disbursed in a manner and under restrictions, if any, that the corporation may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, are less than the cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of the deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds, are deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference of priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue exceed the cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for the bonds or may be applied to the payment of the cost of any project thereafter financed under the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the corporation may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when definitive bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. The corporation may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which become mutilated or are destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this chapter without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of the state, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things, other than those proceedings, conditions, or things which are specifically required by this chapter.</p>

<p class="p6">In the discretion of the corporation, any bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the corporation and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. The trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received and may convey, or mortgage or grant, a security interest in any project or any part of it or any combination of projects or parts of them. The trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders or noteholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including: covenants establishing the duties of the corporation in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation, and insurance of the project or projects in connection with which the bonds have been authorized, and in relation to the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys; and conditions or limitations with respect to the issuance of additional bonds. It is lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish indemnifying bonds or to pledge those securities that may be required by the corporation. Any trust agreement may establish the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the preceding, any trust agreement or resolution may contain any other provisions that the corporation may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of the trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the corporation’s cost of operation and maintenance.</p>

Laws § 45-55-9 explicitly provided that the contracts to which R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-55-5 applied were procurements and purchases. Kayak Ctr. at Wickford Cove, LLC v.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>City was entitled to judgment on a contractor’s claim of improper award of a concessions contract because (1) R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-55-5 did not apply to concession contracts, (2) the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in finding that the contractor failed to show corruption, bad faith, or abuse of discretion, (3) a competitor’s bid was financially superior, (4) the RFP provided that the city could accept or reject any proposal, and (5) the parties did not agree to a contract extension.

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The school committee properly arrived at its decision to award the school improvement contract to the second highest bidder. The school committee evaluated each of the bids on the basis of objective, measurable criteria, all of which were published in the RFP, and the judiciary does not want to assume the position of litigating the award of every government contract nor does it want to put public officials in a “legalistic straitjacket”.

<p class="p6">The general assembly hereby recognizes and declares that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> The general assembly finds that stormwater, when not properly controlled and treated, causes pollution of the waters of the state, threatens public health, and damages property. Stormwater carries pollutants and other material from the land — such as human and animal waste, oil, gasoline, grease, fertilizers, nutrients, and sediments — into rivers, streams, ponds, coves, drinking water aquifers, and Narragansett Bay. Stormwater reaches the state’s waters by streets, roads, lawns, and other means. As a result, public use of the natural resources of state for drinking water, swimming, fishing, shellfishing, and other forms of recreation is limited and in some cases prohibited.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> The general assembly further finds that inattention to stormwater management results in erosion of soils and destruction of both public and private property, thereby putting public safety at risk and harming property values and uses, including agriculture and industry. Therefore, to help alleviate existing and future degradation of the state’s waters and the associated risks to public health and safety, and to comply with state and federal stormwater management requirements, stormwater conveyance systems must be maintained and improved. The state of Rhode Island is delegated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to implement “Phase II” stormwater management regulations, which require municipalities and other persons to increase their capacity to control stormwater. The Department of Environmental Management’s Pollution Discharge Elimination System program has promulgated these regulations.</p>

Said assessment shall be adopted by ordinance of the town council after public hearing thereon, shall be imposed only after said stormwater control system shall have been installed and shall be formulated to repay to the town the actual costs of construction of said storm water control system, including design, permitting, debt service and costs on any issuance of bonds or notes issued to finance the same, or such portion thereof as the town shall deem appropriate, over a period not to exceed twenty (20) years, (or the repayment term of any bonds or notes utilized to finance same, whichever may be greater). Said assessment to owners of abutting land shall be at a uniform rate for each foot of frontage of land abutting on a street, highway or right-of-way, into which a subsurface stormwater control system shall have been installed by the town; provided, however, that a minimum rate may be established for any lot having foot frontage of less than fifty (50) feet which rate may be equal to that charged for a lot with foot frontage of fifty (50) feet; provided, that a higher rate per foot frontage may be assessed to a lot of land upon which a dwelling or other structure is located than an unimproved lot of land, and further provided, that whenever any lot is located at the intersection of two (2) streets, highways or rights-of-way in which stormwater drainage lines have been constructed at the expense of the town of Middletown hereunder the assessment on such lot shall be made only for the stormwater drainage line on one street, highway or right-of-way, that being the street, highway or right-of-way having the greatest linear foot frontage.

<p class="p4"><b>45-65-3.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Legislative findings.</b></p>
<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">It is the intention of the general assembly to begin the process of ensuring the sustainability of locally administered pension plans and to advance and maintain the long-term stability of such plans. The general assembly finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Rhode Island law authorizes and empowers municipalities to administer their own municipal pension plans; currently, there are thirty-six (36) such plans administered by twenty-four (24) municipalities.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> According to a report by the Office of the Auditor General entitled Pension and OPEB Plans Administered by Rhode Island Municipalities (September 2011): “Many municipal pension plans are severely underfunded which presents the risk that sufficient funds will not be available to meet promised benefits to retirees. It also undermines the overall fiscal health of the plan’s sponsor.”</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> It is in the best interests of individual employees, taxpayers, municipalities and the state itself to maintain viable and sustainable municipal public pension plans. These interests include:</p>
<p class="p6">Preserving a level of pension benefits that is, over the long term, reasonable for current and retired municipal employees and affordable for taxpayers;</p>
<p class="p6">Avoiding significant and unanticipated retirement benefit reductions, which could cause an increase in poverty among retired municipal employees and a resulting strain on state social services;</p>
<p class="p6">Maintaining investments in infrastructure and education on the state and local levels in lieu of diverting critical resources to satisfy pension obligations;</p>
<p class="p6">Preventing the financial downgrade of municipalities by rating agencies as a result of unfunded pension obligations, which would make it more difficult to access the capital markets and increase the costs of borrowing;</p>
<p class="p6">Encouraging rating agencies, in recognition of the state’s proactive approach toward financial discipline, to take positive credit actions on Rhode Island municipal bonds; and</p>
<p class="p6">Creating a more stable and well-managed environment in Rhode Island to attract new businesses and maintain and expand existing businesses, which will diminish the uncertainty and fiscal instability that accompany uncontrolled pension obligations.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> The first step in ensuring the viability and sustainability of local pension plans is to get an accurate analysis of the current condition and fiscal health of the individual plans.</p>

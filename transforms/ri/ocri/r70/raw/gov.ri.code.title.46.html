Furthermore, it is the policy of the state of Rhode Island that the state permission to use tidal lands is separate and distinct from the state’s conveyance of its fee title estate, or any real estate interest, in the tidal lands.

Moreover, any leasehold interest or license to use those lands may only arise under the authority of the general assembly whether exercised by the general assembly itself or exercised pursuant to a valid delegation to a duly authorized instrumentality of the state.

Without impairing any right, title, or interest that may have previously vested, any placement of fill to a harbor line or other filling of tidal lands, which has not been commenced and completed as of the date of the enactment of this section [July 18, 2000], shall not be effective as conveying the state’s title nor as a limitation on the public trust.</p>

Subsequent to the effective date of this section [July 18, 2000], no title to any freehold estate in any tidal land or filled land can be acquired by any private individual unless it is formally conveyed by explicit grant of the state by the general assembly for public trust purposes.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Subsequent to the effective date of this section [July 18, 2000], no lease of any tidal land or filled land, and no license to use any of that land, can be acquired by any private individual or entity unless the lease or license has been specifically approved for public trust purposes by the general assembly itself or under the specific authority of the general assembly such as, but not limited to, the delegation of authority under chapter 23 of this title.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> No filling or dredging operation commenced or continued subsequent to the effective date of this section [July 18, 2000] on tidal lands, whether or not title to the tidal land is held by the state pursuant to this section, may be conducted unless the individual or entity conducting the operation obtains and satisfies all appropriate and applicable regulatory authorizations and approvals.

The general assembly has the responsibility and the sole authority to arrive at, and define, by its enactment, a policy balance between or among the competing proposed uses or developments for tidal lands and the respective competing assertions concerning the public interests in those lands, and that determination shall be deemed to be, and be accepted as, the authoritative definition of the public interest in relation to the preservation and use of tidal lands.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Where an insured alleges that a spill of hazardous contaminants in 1974 migrated through the groundwater, causing immediate injury to the pertinent property which was not discovered, however, until at least 1979, coverage under a general liability policy would be triggered by an occurrence that took place when property damage, which includes property loss, manifested itself or was discovered or in the exercise of reasonable diligence would be discoverable.

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> It is hereby found that there exists and will in the future exist within the state of Rhode Island the need to construct facilities and to facilitate projects for the abatement of pollution caused by wastewater for the enhancement of the waters of the state, and for the completion of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in order to save property owners money and to encourage job and business growth in Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> It is hereby further found that to meet water quality goals under federal and state law, and to secure maximum benefit of funding programs available under federal and state law pertaining to wastewater pollution abatement projects, it is necessary to establish a revolving loan fund program in accordance with federal and state law to provide a perpetual source of low cost financing for water pollution abatement projects.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> It is hereby further found that to secure maximum benefit to the state from funding programs available under federal and state law and, to the extent permissible to attract private capital, for water pollution abatement projects, for safe drinking water projects, for municipal road and bridge projects, and other infrastructure related projects, it is necessary to establish a finance agency to administer the revolving loan funds and other financing mechanisms, and for the finance agency to work with the department of environmental management, Rhode Island department of transportation, the Rhode Island office of energy resources and other federal and state agencies for proper administration of revolving loan funds and other financing mechanisms.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> It is hereby further found that cities and towns can lower the costs of borrowing for road and bridge projects through cooperation with the Rhode Island infrastructure bank and that greater coordination among cities and towns will enable more efficient allocation of infrastructure resources by the state of Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> It is hereby further found that the geographic size of and population of Rhode Island, while often derided as an impediment to economic growth, are potential assets, not handicaps, to better infrastructure development.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> It is hereby further found that initiatives for infrastructure finance can best be accomplished through a new, streamlined entity that seeks to foster and develop a public-private sector partnership that takes advantage of all of Rhode Island’s strengths.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> It is hereby further found that expanding the Rhode Island clean water finance agency and renaming it the Rhode Island infrastructure bank provides the best avenue for reducing ongoing pollution to the waters of the state and emissions that degrade air quality and contribute to climate change while fostering the creation of jobs and the realization of energy cost savings through the facilitation of infrastructure improvements.</p>

Effective September 1, 2015, whenever, in any general law, public law, rule, regulation, bylaw and/or otherwise, any reference is made to the Rhode Island clean water finance agency, by name or otherwise, the reference shall be deemed to refer to and mean the “Rhode Island infrastructure bank.” The agency shall take all necessary actions to effectuate this name change, including, but not limited to, changing the name of the agency on file with any government office. The exercise by the agency of the powers conferred by this chapter shall be deemed to be the performance of an essential public function.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Nothing in this act shall be construed to change or modify the corporate existence of the former Rhode Island clean water finance agency, or to change or modify any contracts or agreements of any kind by, for, or to which the Rhode Island clean water finance agency is a party thereto.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The powers of the agency shall be exercised by or under the supervision of a board of directors consisting of five (5) members, four of whom shall be members of the public appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the senate. The governor in making these appointments shall give due consideration to persons skilled and experienced in law, finance, and public administration and give further due consideration to a recommendation by the general treasurer for one of those appointments. All appointments made by the governor shall serve for a term of two (2) years. No one shall be eligible for appointment unless he or she is a resident of this state. The members of the board of directors as of the effective date of this act [July 15, 2005] who were appointed to the board of directors by members of the general assembly shall cease to be members of the board of directors on the effective date of this act. As of the effective date of this act, the general treasurer or his or her designee, who shall be a subordinate within the general treasurer’s department, shall serve on the board of directors as an ex-officio member. Those members of the board of directors as of the effective date of this act who were appointed to the board of directors by the governor shall continue to serve the balance of their current terms.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Each member of the board of directors shall serve until his or her successor is appointed and qualified. The appointed member of the board of directors shall be eligible for reappointment. Any member of the board of directors appointed to fill a vacancy of a public member on the board shall be appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the senate, for the unexpired term of the vacant position in the same manner as the member’s predecessor as set forth in subsection (c) of this section. The public members of the board of directors shall be removable by the governor, pursuant to § 36-1-7 and for cause only, and removal solely for partisan or personal reasons unrelated to capacity or fitness for the office shall be unlawful. The governor shall designate one member of the board of directors to be the chairperson of the agency to serve in such capacity during his or her term as a member. The board of directors may elect from among its members such other officers as they deem necessary. Three (3) members of the board of directors shall constitute a quorum. A majority vote of those present shall be required for action. No vacancy in the membership of the board of directors shall impair the right of a quorum to exercise the powers of the board of directors. The members of the board of directors shall serve without compensation, but each member shall be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of his or her duties.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Notwithstanding any other provision of general or special law to the contrary, any member of the board of directors, who is also an officer or employee of the state or of a local governmental unit or other public body, shall not thereby be precluded from voting for or acting on behalf of the agency, the state, or local governmental unit or other public body on any matter involving the agency, the state, or that local governmental unit or other public body, and any director, officer, employee, or agent of the agency shall not be precluded from acting for the agency on any particular matter solely because of any interest therein which is shared generally with a substantial segment of the public.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> In addition to the board of directors, there is hereby created a green infrastructure strategic advisory council (the “advisory council”). The advisory council shall exist to advise the board of directors on advances related to green infrastructure, energy efficiency, and renewable energy and to make recommendations on potential opportunities for new programs and/or updates to existing programs. The advisory council shall consist of: the executive director of the Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank, or designee, the chairperson of the Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank board of directors, or designee, the secretary of commerce, or designee, the director of the department of environmental management, or designee, the commissioner of the office of energy resources, or designee, the director of the department of health, or designee, the director of the department of transportation, or designee and the executive director of Rhode Island housing, or designee.

The agency shall determine the form of bonds, and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds, and the place or places of payment of principal, redemption premium, if any, and interest, which may be paid at any bank or trust company within or without the state. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds shall cease to be the officer before the delivery thereof, the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if the officer had remained in office until delivery. The agency may provide for authentication of bonds by a trustee, fiscal agent, registrar, or transfer agency. Bonds may be issued in bearer or in registered form, or both, and, if notes, may be made payable to the bearer or to order, as the agency may determine. The agency may also establish and maintain a system of registration for any bonds whereby the name of the registered owner, the rights evidenced by the bonds, the transfer of the bonds, and the rights and other similar matters, are recorded in books or other records maintained by or on behalf of the agency, and no instrument evidencing the bond or rights need be delivered to the registered owner by the agency. A copy of the books or other records of the agency pertaining to any bond registered under a registration system certified by an authorized officer of the agency or by the agent of the agency maintaining the system shall be admissible in any proceeding without further authentication. The board of directors may by resolution delegate to any member or officer of the agency, or any combination thereof, the power to determine any of the matters set forth in this section. In the discretion of the agency, bonds of the agency may be issued with such terms as will cause the interest thereon to be subject to federal income taxation. The agency may sell its bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, for the price, at the rate or rates of interest, or at discount in lieu of interest, as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter or chapter 18 of title 24, as applicable.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The agency may issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, exchangeable for definitive bonds, when the bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The agency may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall have become mutilated or shall have been destroyed or lost. The agency, by itself or through such agency as it may select, may purchase and invite offers to tender for purchase any bonds of the agency at any time outstanding; provided, however, that no purchase by the agency shall be made at a price, exclusive of accrued interest, if any, exceeding the principal amount thereof or, if greater, the redemption price of the bonds when next redeemable at the option of the agency, and may resell any bonds so purchased in such manner and for such price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter or chapter 19.16 of title 23, chapter 18 of title 24, and chapter 26.5 of title 39, as applicable.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> In the discretion of the board of directors, any bonds issued under this section may be secured by a trust agreement in such form and executed in such manner as may be determined by the board of directors, between the agency and the purchasers or holders of the bonds, or between the agency and a corporate trustee which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. The trust agreement may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, any loan agreements, local governmental obligations and non-governmental obligations, and the revenues, funds, and other assets or property held or to be received by the agency, including without limitation all moneys and investments on deposit from time to time in the water pollution control revolving fund, the Rhode Island water pollution control revolving fund, and the local interest subsidy trust fund, or the municipal road and bridge revolving fund, as applicable, and any contract or other rights to receive the same, whether then existing or thereafter coming into existence and whether then held or thereafter acquired by the agency, and the proceeds thereof. The trust agreement may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights, security, and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, provisions defining defaults and providing for remedies in the event thereof which may include the acceleration of maturities, restrictions on the individual right of action by bondholders, and covenants setting forth the duties of and limitations on the agency in relation to the custody, safeguarding, investment, and application of moneys, the enforcement of loan agreements, local governmental obligations and non-governmental obligations, the issue of additional or refunding bonds, the fixing, revision, charging, and collection of charges, the use of any surplus bond proceeds, the establishment of reserves, and the making and amending of contracts.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> In the discretion of the board of directors, any bonds issued under authority of this chapter or chapter 19.16 of title 23, chapter 18 of title 24, and chapter 26.5 of title 39 may be issued by the agency in the form of lines of credit or other banking arrangements under terms and conditions, not inconsistent with this chapter or chapter 19.16 of title 23, chapter 18 of title 24, and chapter 26.5 of title 39, and under such agreements with the purchasers or makers thereof or any agent or other representative of such purchasers or makers, as the board of directors may determine to be in the best interests of the agency. In addition to other security provided herein or otherwise by law, bonds issued by the agency under any provision of this chapter or chapter 19.16 of title 23, chapter 18 of title 24, and chapter 26.5 of title 39 may be secured, in whole or in part, by financial guarantees, by insurance, or by letters or lines of credit issued to the agency or a trustee or any other person, by any bank, trust company, insurance or surety company, or other financial institution, within or without the state, and the agency may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, any loan agreements, local governmental obligations and non-governmental obligations, and the revenues, funds, and other assets and property held or to be received by the agency, and any contract or other rights to receive the same, whether then existing or thereafter coming into existence and whether then held or thereafter acquired by the agency, and the proceeds thereof, as security for the guarantees or insurance or for the reimbursement by the agency to any issuer of the line or letter of credit.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company to act as a depository or trustee of the proceeds of bonds, revenues, or other moneys under a trust agreement of the agency, and to furnish indemnification and to provide security as may be required by the agency. It is hereby declared that any pledge or assignment made by the agency under this chapter or chapter 19.16 of title 23, chapter 18 of title 24, and chapter 26.5 of title 39 is an exercise of the governmental powers of the agency, and loan agreements, local governmental obligations and non-governmental obligations, revenues, funds, assets, property, and contract or other rights to receive the same and the proceeds thereof, which are subject to the lien of a pledge or assignment created under this chapter or chapter 19.16 of title 23, chapter 18 of title 24, and chapter 26.5 of title 39, shall not be applied to any purposes not permitted by the pledge or assignment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> Any holder of a bond issued by the agency under the provisions of this chapter or chapter 19.16 of title 23, chapter 18 of title 24, and chapter 26.5 of title 39 and any trustee or other representative under a trust agreement securing the trustee or representative, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by the trust agreement, may bring suit upon the bonds in the superior court and may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceeding for legal or equitable relief, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the state or granted hereunder or under the trust agreement, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this chapter, chapter 19.16 of title 23, chapter 18 of title 24, and chapter 26.5 of title 39, or by the trust agreement, to be performed by the agency or by any officer thereof.</p>

The legislature therefore concludes that it is in the best interest of the state and its citizens to provide a readily available fund for the payment of expenses that the department of environmental management incurs in the protection of the environment of the state from the release of oil. The legislature further recognizes the considerable hardships which may be incurred by the citizens of the state as a direct result of the release of oil into the environment, and therefore the legislature concludes that it is in the best interest of the state to expand the scope of the fund to allow claims from citizens, in certain instances, and to provide for the disbursal of emergency loans from the fund. The legislature lastly concludes that preparedness is an essential component of prevention of and response to oil spill events and, therefore, the purpose of the fund shall be further expanded to support activities which will directly benefit the state in the event of future oil spill events.</p>

The agency shall not award financial assistance to such local government unit or privately organized water supplier hereunder until and unless the department shall have issued a certificate of approval of the project or portion thereof for which such financial assistance has been sought. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for safe drinking water projects funded outside of the drinking water state revolving fund, the Agency may provide financial assistance without the requirement of the issuance of a certificate of approval.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> If the department shall determine, in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this chapter, that an application for financial assistance or portion thereof shall be approved, it shall deliver to the agency a certificate of approval of the project or a portion thereof which shall specify the project or portion thereof eligible for financial assistance and such other terms, conditions and limitations with respect to the construction and operation of the project as the department shall determine.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection with the exercise of its powers and performance of its duties under this chapter, the department shall have all the powers provided by law to the department and its director. The department shall adopt rules, regulations, procedures, and guidelines to carry out the purposes of this chapter and for the proper administration of its powers and duties under this chapter. The rules, regulations, procedures, and guidelines shall include among other things, criteria for determining those safe drinking water projects, to be approved for financial assistance from the safe drinking water revolving fund and specification of eligible costs of the projects. In order to provide for the expenses of the department under this chapter, the agency shall transfer to the department for application to the expenses an amount from the safe drinking water revolving loan fund equal to an amount as the agency and the department shall reasonably determine. The agency and the department shall enter into an operating agreement and amend the same, from time to time, allocating their respective rights, duties, and obligations with respect to the award of financial assistance and grants to finance approved projects under this chapter and establishing procedures for the application, approval, and oversight of projects, financial assistance, and grants.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> In addition to the powers of any local governmental unit provided in any bond act, whenever a local governmental unit has applied for and accepted a loan from the agency and entered into a loan agreement therefor, any local governmental obligations issued by the local governmental unit to evidence the loan may be issued in accordance with, and subject to the limitations of this chapter, notwithstanding the provisions of the bond act authorizing the obligation or any other general or special law or provision of municipal charter to the contrary. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the issuance of local governmental obligations issued under the authority of any bond act, whether heretofore or hereafter enacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no local governmental obligation shall be issued unless authorized by a vote of the body or bodies required by the charter, ordinances, or laws governing the local governmental unit, or the applicable bond act for the authorization of indebtedness of the local governmental unit.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Local governmental obligations issued by any local governmental unit shall be dated, may bear interest at such rate or rates, including rates variable, from time to time, subject to such minimum or maximum rate, if any, as may be determined by such index or other method of determination provided in the applicable loan agreement, shall mature in such amount or amounts and at such time or times, not later than the maximum dates, if any, provided herein, and may be made redeemable in whole or in part before maturity at the option of the local governmental unit or at the option of the agency, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed in the loan agreement prior to the issue of the local governmental obligations. Local governmental obligations may be issued as serial bonds or term bonds or any combination thereof with such provision, if any, for sinking funds for the payment of bonds as the local governmental unit and the agency may agree. The local governmental obligations may be sold at private sale and may be in such form, payable to the bearer thereof or the registered owner, whether certificated or uncertificated, be in such denominations, payable at such place or places, within or without the state, and otherwise bear such terms and conditions not inconsistent with this chapter, as provided in the applicable loan agreement or as the agency and the local governmental unit shall otherwise agree. The local governmental obligations may be issued in principal amount equal to the loan evidenced thereby or at such discount as the agency and the local governmental unit shall agree.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Local governmental obligations shall be payable within a period not exceeding the greater of the period, if any, specified in the applicable bond act or the useful life of the approved project financed by such obligations as determined by the department, or if incurred to finance more than one project, the average useful life of the projects. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the local governmental obligations shall be payable by such equal, increasing, or decreasing installments of principal, annual or otherwise, as will extinguish the obligations at maturity, the first installment to be payable no later than one year after the date of issuance of the obligations or one year after the date of completion of the approved project financed by the obligations, as determined by the department, whichever date is later, and the remaining installments of principal, if any, to be in such amounts and payable on such dates as the agency and the local governmental unit shall agree.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> If a local governmental unit has authorized borrowing in accordance with this chapter and the issuance of local governmental obligations to evidence the borrowing under any bond act, the local governmental unit may, subject to the applicable loan agreement and with the approval of the agency, issue notes to the agency in anticipation of the loan. The issuance of the notes shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter relating to the issue of bonds other than notes, to the extent applicable, provided the maturity date of the notes shall not exceed five (5) years from the date of issue of the notes, or the expected date of completion of the approved project financed thereby as determined by the department, if later. Notes issued for less than the maximum maturity date may be renewed by the issue of other notes maturing no later than the maximum maturity date.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> A local governmental unit may issue local governmental obligations to refund or pay at maturity or earlier redemption any local governmental obligations outstanding under any loan agreement, or to refund or pay any other debt of the local governmental unit issued to finance the approved project to which the loan agreement pertains. The refunding local governmental obligations may be issued in sufficient amounts to pay or provide for the principal of the obligations refunded, any redemption premium thereon, any interest accrued and to accrue to the date of payment of the obligations, the costs of issuance of the refunding obligations and any reserves required by the applicable loan agreement. The issue of refunding local governmental obligations, the amount and dates of maturity or maturities of local governmental obligations, the amount and dates of maturity or maturities and other details thereof, the security therefor, and the rights, duties, and obligations of the local governmental unit in respect to the same shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter relating to the issue of local governmental obligations other than refunding obligations as this chapter may be applicable.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The agency may provide by resolution of the board of directors for the issuance, from time to time, of bonds, notes or any other evidences of indebtedness of the agency for any of its corporate purposes or for the borrowing of money in anticipation of the issuance of the bonds. Bonds issued by the agency may be issued as general obligations of the agency or as special obligations payable solely from particular revenues or funds as may be provided for in any trust agreement or other agreement securing bonds. The agency may also provide by resolution of the board of directors for the issuance, from time to time, of temporary notes in anticipation of the revenues to be collected or received by the agency, including, without limitation, in anticipation of any payments to the agency from the state, or in anticipation of the receipt of other grants or aid. The issue of notes shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter relating to the issue of bonds of the agency other than temporary notes as this chapter may be applicable; provided, however, that notes issued in anticipation of revenues shall mature no later than one year from their respective dates, or the date of expected receipt of the revenues, if later, and notes issued in anticipation of grants, or other aid and renewals thereof, shall mature no later than six (6) months after the expected date of receipt of the grant or aid.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The bonds of each issue shall be dated, may bear interest at such rate or rates, including rates variable from time to time as determined by such index, banker’s loan rate, or other method determined by the agency, and shall mature or otherwise be payable at such time or times, as may be determined by the agency, and may be made redeemable before maturity at the option of the agency or the holder thereof at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the agency. The agency shall determine the form of bonds, and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds, and the place or places of payment of principal, redemption premium, if any, and interest, which may be paid at any bank or trust company within or without the state. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds shall cease to be the officer before the delivery thereof, the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if the officer had remained in office until delivery. The agency may provide for authentication of bonds by a trustee, fiscal agent, registrar, or transfer agency. Bonds may be issued in bearer or in registered form, or both, and if notes, may be made payable to the bearer or to order, as the agency may determine. The agency may also establish and maintain a system of registration for any bonds whereby the name of the registered owner, the rights evidenced by the bonds, the transfer of the bonds, and the rights and other similar matters, are recorded in books or other records maintained by or on behalf of the agency, and no instrument evidencing the bonds or rights need be delivered to the registered owner by the agency. A copy of the books or other records of the agency pertaining to any bond registered under a registration system certified by an authorized officer of the agency or by the agent of the agency maintaining the system shall be admissible in any proceeding without further authentication. The board of directors may by resolution delegate to any member or officer of the agency, or any combination thereof, the power to determine any of the matters set forth in this section. In the discretion of the agency, bonds of the agency may be issued with such terms as will cause the interest thereon to be subject to federal income taxation. The agency may sell its bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, for the price, at the rate or rates of interest, or at discount in lieu of interest, as it may determine will best affect the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The agency may issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, exchangeable for definitive bonds, when the bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The agency may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall have become mutilated or shall have been destroyed or lost. The agency, by itself or through such agency as it may select, may purchase and invite offers to tender for purchase any bonds of the agency at any time outstanding; provided, however, that no purchase by the agency shall be made at a price, exclusive of accrued interest, if any, exceeding the principal amount thereof or, if greater, the redemption price of the bonds when next redeemable at the option of the agency, and may resell any bonds so purchased in such manner and for such price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> In the discretion of the board of directors, any bonds issued hereunder may be secured by a trust agreement in such form and executed in such manner as may be determined by the board of directors, between the agency and the purchasers or holders of the bonds, or between the agency and a corporate trustee which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. The trust agreement may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, any loan agreements and local governmental obligations, and the revenues, funds, and other assets or property held or to be received by the agency, including without limitation all moneys and investments on deposit from time to time in the safe drinking water revolving loan fund, and any contract or other rights to receive the same, whether then existing or thereafter coming into existence and whether then held or thereafter acquired by the agency, and the proceeds thereof. The trust agreement may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights, security, and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, provisions defining defaults and providing for remedies in the event thereof which may include the acceleration of maturities, restrictions on the individual right of action by bondholders, and covenants setting forth the duties of and limitations on the agency in relation to the custody, safeguarding, investment, and application of moneys, the enforcement of loan agreements and local governmental obligations, the issue of additional or refunding bonds, the fixing, revision, charging, and collection of charges, the use of any surplus bond proceeds, the establishment of reserves, and the making and amending of contracts.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> In the discretion of the board of directors, any bond issued under authority of this chapter may be issued by the agency in the form of lines of credit or other banking arrangements under terms and conditions, not inconsistent with this chapter, and under such agreements with the purchasers or makers thereof or any agent or other representative of such purchasers or makers, as the board of directors may determine to be in the best interest of the agency. In addition to other security provided herein or otherwise by law, bonds issued by the agency under any provision of this chapter may be secured, in whole or in part, by financial guarantees, by insurance, or by letters or lines of credit issued to the agency or a trustee or any other person, by any bank, trust company, insurance or surety company, or other financial institution, within or without the state, and the agency may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, any loan agreements and any local governmental obligations or obligations of any privately organized water supplier, and the revenues, funds, and other assets and property held or to be received by the agency, and any contract or other rights to receive the same, whether then existing or thereafter coming into existence and whether then held or thereafter acquired by the agency, and the proceeds thereof, as security for the guarantees or insurance or for the reimbursement by the agency to any issuer of the line or letter of credit.</p>

<p class="p6">The general assembly finds: (1) That a state administered underground storage tank (UST) clean-up fund is needed to provide an effective mechanism for USTs owners to comply with financial responsibility requirements and to insure that the environmental and public health impacts of UST leaks are addressed in an effective and timely manner.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Certain tank owners must be able to demonstrate one million dollars ($1,000,000) of liability coverage to satisfy the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR Part 280.90 et seq., as published in the Federal Register dated October 26, 1988 and by Final Rule dated February 18, 1993). Specifically the EPA requirement is that certain tank owners must demonstrate financial responsibility of up to one million dollars ($1,000,000) per incident and up to two million dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate for damages. Failure by the state to create a state-sponsored fund will result in enforcement action by the EPA which can include both financial penalties against tank owners and closure of tanks, if the owner fails to demonstrate financial responsibility.</p>

Each distributor shall be responsible to the tax administrator for the collection of the regulatory fee, and if the distributor is unable to recover the fee from the person who ordered the product, the distributor shall nonetheless remit to the tax administrator the regulatory fee associated with the delivery. In accordance with the regulations to be promulgated hereunder, the fee shall be collected, reported, and paid to the Rhode Island division of taxation as a separate, line-item entry, on a quarterly tax report by those persons charged with the collection, reporting, and payment of motor fuels taxes.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the fee shall not be applicable to purchases by the United States government.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Of the one-cent-per-gallon ($0.01) environmental protection regulatory fee collected by distributors of motor fuel and paid to the Rhode Island division of taxation, one-half cent ($0.005) shall be deposited in the intermodal surface transportation fund to be distributed pursuant to § 31-36-20 and one-half cent ($0.005) shall be paid to the fund. All environmental protection regulatory fees paid to the department shall be received by the department, which shall keep such money in a distinct, interest-bearing, restricted-receipt account to the credit of, and for the exclusive use of, the fund provided that for the period January 1, 2008, through June 30, 2008, all revenues generated by the environmental protection regulatory fee, up to a maximum of two million dollars ($2,000,000), shall be deposited into the general fund. In fiscal year 2009, all revenues generated by the environmental protection regulatory fee, up to a maximum equivalent to two million two hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred dollars ($2,237,500), shall be deposited into the intermodal surface transportation fund. All fees collected may be invested as provided by law and all interest received on such investment shall be credited to the fund.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> There is hereby established in the water resources board a Rhode Island water facilities assistance program. The board shall administer this program so as to ensure the proper and systematic development of coordinated water supply and transmission facilities and shall expend the funds available under this chapter in a manner that accomplishes this objective.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> This program shall provide twenty-five percent (25%) of the cost of approved water transmission facilities designed and constructed to serve a single water system, and shall provide fifty percent (50%) of the cost of approved intersystem facilities. Only the construction of water transmission and intersystem facilities and the acquisition of land or rights-of-way, together with necessary engineering and design, are eligible for assistance under this program. Costs of borrowing, amortization costs, legal, and all other costs attendant to the funding of water transmission and intersystem facilities are not eligible for financial assistance under this program and must be fully borne by the project applicant. The cost of distribution facilities as defined in this chapter are not eligible for financial assistance under this program. Determinations of project eligibility shall be made by the water resources board.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> Only municipalities and quasi municipal water agencies are eligible to apply for assistance under this program. Determinations of applicant eligibility shall be made by the water resources board.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> Only projects reviewed and approved by the water resources board, the division of public utilities and carriers, and the state planning council may be funded. Each project supported by this program must be consistent with a plan adopted and kept current by the water resources board in accordance with § 46-15-6 and with applicable elements of the state guide plan, as adopted and kept current by the state planning council in accordance with § 42-11-10(c); provided, however, that with respect to any project which has been approved by the board and which thereafter becomes eligible to participate as an intersystem facilities project, the submission to, and approval by, the public utilities commission and statewide planning council shall not be required.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> Each transmission facility supported by this program must link a water source with a water distribution system, both of which are complete and operational or will be so at the time that the transmission facility is completed or is projected for future construction. The capacity of both the water source and the distribution system must be adequate to meet present and future needs, considering all other demands that may be placed on the same sources and distribution systems. All determinations required under this subsection shall be made in a timely fashion by the water resources board.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> The quality of water to be conveyed through the proposed transmission system must meet the Rhode Island department of health requirements for the most restrictive current or planned use. All reasonable measures to assure that this level of water quality will be maintained must have been taken.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(g)</b> The design and construction of an approved transmission facility must ensure that it will remain operational for its design life with routine maintenance, and that it will resist all external and internal forces that can be reasonably anticipated as determined by the water resources board.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(h)</b> The water resources board will ensure that maintenance of the transmission facility is performed in a manner that ensures that it will remain operational throughout its design life and is assured by a dedicated revenue such as a user fee or some other equally reliable means.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> There is hereby imposed on each supplier of water, for the purpose of protecting the quality and safety of the public supply of water, a charge to be known as a “water quality protection charge” based upon billings for sales of every supplier of public drinking water at the rate of two and ninety two hundredth cents ($.0292) per one hundred (100) gallons of each sale, whether the water is used for drinking or other purposes. No supplier shall impose a water quality protection charge upon sales to other suppliers of drinking water. Except as provided in subsections (c), (d) and (e) hereof, the supplier shall add any water quality protection charge imposed hereunder to the sale price, and, when added, the water quality protection charge shall constitute a part of the price and shall also be a debt from the purchaser to the supplier and be collectible in the same manner and have the benefit of any lien provided for the amounts due for water charges from the purchaser to the supplier.

Subject to the provisions of § 39-1.1-1 for those suppliers which are public utilities, all suppliers may terminate service for failure of purchasers to pay the water quality protection charge.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Any water quality protection charge imposed hereunder shall not take effect earlier than January 1, 1989; provided, however, the increase in water quality protection charge by one and one-third cents ($0.01333) established by <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>P.L. 1990, Ch. 65, Art. 39, § 1 shall take effect and be chargeable on all billings for water sales made by a supplier on and after July 1, 1991.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> All commercial agricultural producers, including those who provide food and fiber, shall be exempt for that amount of water used to irrigate commercial crops either in fields or greenhouses, provided, that the producers have a conservation plan on file with their respective soil conservation districts.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> No water quality protection charge shall be imposed on that portion of such supplier’s retail billing representing potable water furnished to customers by purchase of water in its finished, potable form from sources outside the state. The water quality protection charge imposed by a supplier purchasing potable water from outside the state shall be pro rata imposed on such supplier’s retail billings for that portion of potable water supplied from within the state in accordance with rules and regulations to be finally promulgated by the water resources board on or before September 1, 1992.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> If any supplier of water fails to pay the water quality protection charge imposed upon it, upon determination by the water resources board of failure to pay and the amount unpaid, there shall be withheld from any state aid or grants of any nature due such supplier an equivalent amount and such monies shall be transferred to the appropriate water quality protection fund created under § 46-15.3-10.</p>

<p class="p6">The commission on interstate cooperation, acting with and through the office of the attorney general, is hereby directed to negotiate with the proper authorities of the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut a compact in substantially the following form, which is hereby ratified:</p>
<p class="p6"><b>NEW ENGLAND INTERSTATE WATER <br>
POLLUTION CONTROL COMPACT</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Whereas, the growth of population and the development of the territory of the New England states has resulted in serious pollution of certain interstate streams, ponds and lakes, and of tidal waters ebbing and flowing past the boundaries of two (2) or more states; and</p>
<p class="p6">Whereas, such pollution constitutes a menace to the health, welfare and economic prosperity of the people living in such area; and</p>
<p class="p6">Whereas, the abatement of existing pollution and the control of future pollution in the interstate waters of the New England area are of prime importance to the people and can best be accomplished through the co-operation of the New England states in the establishment of an interstate agency to work with the states in the field of pollution abatement;</p>
<p class="p6">Now, therefore, the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont do agree and are bound as follows:</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE I</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">It is agreed between the signatory states that the provisions of this compact shall apply to streams, ponds and lakes which are contiguous to two (2) or more signatory states or which flow through two (2) or more signatory states or which have a tributary contiguous to two (2) or more signatory states or flowing through two (2) or more signatory states, and also shall apply to tidal waters ebbing and flowing past the boundaries of two (2) states.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE II</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">There is hereby created the New England interstate water pollution control commission (hereinafter referred to as <i>“the commission”</i>) which shall be a body corporate and politic, having the powers, duties and jurisdiction herein enumerated and such other and additional powers as shall be conferred upon it by the act or acts of a signatory state concurred in by the others.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE III</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The commission shall consist of five (5) commissioners from each signatory state, each of whom shall be a resident voter of the state from which he or she is appointed. The commissioners shall be chosen in the manner and for the terms provided by law of the state from which they shall be appointed. For each state there shall be on the commission a member representing the state health department, a member representing the state water pollution control board (if such exists), and, except where a state in its enabling legislation decides that the best interests of the state will be otherwise served, a member representing municipal interests, a member representing industrial interests, and a member representing an agency acting for fisheries or conservation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE IV</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The commission shall annually elect from its members a chairperson and vice chairperson and shall appoint and at its pleasure remove or discharge such officers. It may appoint and employ a secretary who shall be a professional engineer versed in water pollution and may employ such stenographic or clerical employees as shall be necessary, and at its pleasure remove or discharge such employees. It shall adopt a seal and suitable bylaws and shall promulgate rules and regulations for its management and control. It may maintain an office for the transaction of its business and may meet at any time or place within the signatory states. Meetings shall be held at least twice each year. A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but no action of the commission imposing any obligations on any signatory state or on any municipal agency or subdivision thereof or on any person, firm or corporation therein shall be binding unless a majority of the members from such signatory state shall have voted in favor thereof. Where meetings are planned to discuss matters relevant to problems of water pollution control affecting only certain of the signatory states, the commission may vote to authorize special meetings of the commissioners of the states especially concerned. The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements and shall make an annual report to the governor and the legislature of each signatory state setting forth in detail the operations and transactions conducted by it pursuant to this compact, and shall make recommendations for any legislative action deemed by it advisable, including amendments to the statutes of the signatory states which may be necessary to carry out the intent and purposes of this compact. The commission shall not incur any obligations for salaries, office, administrative, traveling or other expenses prior to the allotment of funds by the signatory states adequate to meet the same; nor shall the commission pledge the credit of any of the signatory states. Each state reserves the right to provide hereafter by law for the examination and audit of the accounts of the commission. The commission shall appoint a treasurer who may be a member of the commission, and disbursements by the commission shall be valid only when authorized by the commission and when vouchers therefor have been signed by the secretary and countersigned by the treasurer. The secretary shall be custodian of the records of the commission with authority to attest to and certify such records or copies thereof.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE V</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">It is recognized, owing to such variable factors as location, size, character and flow and the many varied uses of the waters subject to the terms of this compact, that no single standard of sewage and waste treatment and no single standard of quality of receiving waters is practical and that the degree of treatment of sewage and industrial wastes should take into account the classification of the receiving waters according to present and proposed highest use, such as for drinking water supply, industrial and agricultural uses, bathing and other recreational purposes, maintenance and propagation of fish life, shellfish culture, navigation and disposal of wastes.</p>
<p class="p6">The commission shall establish reasonable physical, chemical and bacteriological standards of water quality satisfactory for various classifications of use. It is agreed that each of the signatory states through appropriate agencies will prepare a classification of its interstate waters in entirety or by portions according to present and proposed highest use and for this purpose technical experts employed by state departments of health and state water pollution control agencies are authorized to confer on questions relating to classification of interstate waters affecting two (2) or more states. Each signatory state agrees to submit its classification of its interstate waters to the commission for approval. It is agreed that after such approval all signatory states through their appropriate state health departments and water pollution control agencies will work to establish programs of treatment of sewage and industrial wastes which will meet standards established by the commission for classified waters. The commission may from time to time make such changes in definitions of classifications and in standards as may be required by changed conditions or as may be necessary for uniformity.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE VI</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Each of the signatory states pledges to provide for the abatement of existing pollution and for the control of future pollution of interstate inland and tidal waters as described in Article I, and to put and maintain the waters thereof in a satisfactory condition consistent with the highest classified use of each body of water.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE VII</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Nothing in this compact shall be construed to repeal or prevent the enactment of any legislation or prevent the enforcement of any requirement by any signatory state imposing any additional condition or restriction to further lessen the pollution of waters within its jurisdiction. Nothing herein contained shall affect or abate any action now pending brought by any governmental board or body created by or existing under any of the signatory states.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE VIII</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The signatory states agree to appropriate for the salaries, office, administrative, travel and other expenses such sum or sums as shall be recommended by the commission. The state of Massachusetts obligates itself only to the extent of six thousand five hundred dollars ($6,500) in any one year, the state of Connecticut only to the extent of three thousand dollars ($3,000) in any one year, the state of Rhode Island only to the extent of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) in any one year, and the states of New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont each only to the extent of one thousand dollars ($1,000) in any one year.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE IX</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">Should any part of this compact be held to be contrary to the constitution of any signatory state or of the United States, all other parts thereof shall continue to be in full force and effect.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE X</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The commission is authorized to discuss with appropriate state agencies in New York state questions of pollution of waters which flow into the New England area from New York state or vice versa and to further the establishment of agreements on pollution abatement to promote the interests of the New York and New England areas.</p>
<p class="p6">Whenever the commission by majority vote of the members of each signatory state shall have given its approval and the state of New York shall have taken the necessary action to do so, the state of New York shall be a party to this compact for the purpose of controlling and abating the pollution of waterways common to New York and the New England states signatory to this compact but excluding the waters under the jurisdiction of the interstate sanitation commission (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut).</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE XI</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">This compact shall become effective immediately upon the adoption of the compact by any two (2) contiguous states of New England but only insofar as applies to those states and upon approval by federal law. Thereafter upon ratification by other contiguous states, it shall also become effective as to those states.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE I</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The northeastern part of the United States is by virtue of geographic location and other characteristics a great natural resource area which, with more intense use of natural resources, increasingly requires coordinated planning as a basic ingredient of effective resource management and orderly growth of the region. The work of the New England-New York interagency committee demonstrated that a continuation and furtherance of activities such as those undertaken by it would be of great value. To this end, it is the intent of this compact to establish and provide for the operation of a joint agency for the northeast.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>ARTICLE II</b> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">It is the purpose of this compact to provide, in the northeastern region, improved facilities and procedures for the coordination of the policies, programs, and activities of the United States, the several states, and private persons or entities, in the field of water and related land resources, and to study, investigate, and plan the development and use of the same and conservation of such water and related land resources; to provide means by which conflicts may be resolved; and to provide procedures for coordination of the interests of all public and private agencies, persons and entities in the field of water and related land resources; and to provide an organization for cooperation in such coordination on both the federal and state levels of government.</p>

The efforts of the commission in coordination of work and resolution of conflicts may be directed towards all state and federal activities involved in water and related land resources development responsibilities and shall include coordination of the following:</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The General Assembly finds the following:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Antifoulant paints containing tributyltin based biocides are widely used on vessels in the state to inhibit the growth of marine fouling organisms, such as barnacles, that increase drag and reduce vessel speed and fuel and operating efficiency;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Laboratory and field studies have shown that tributyltin is highly toxic to marine and fresh water organisms, especially mollusks and juvenile life stages, at extremely low concentrations;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> The United States Environmental Protection Agency has determined that concentrations of tributyltin currently in the waters of the United States may pose unreasonable risks to oysters, clams, fish, and other marine life;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> The continued unrestricted use of tributyltin based antifoulant paints in this state poses a threat to commercially important fish and shellfish species and may ultimately pose a threat to public health;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> Vessels less than sixty-five (65) meters in length that are coated with tributyltin antifoulant paint account for a substantial amount of the tributyltin released into the aquatic environment, especially in restricted bays and inlets where tributyltin concentrations are most likely to build to dangerous levels; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> Most antifoulant paint containing tributyltin that is used on vessels less than sixty-five (65) meters in length is applied during the spring months prior to the summer boating season.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> The purpose of this chapter is to protect the living marine and fresh water resources of the state, as well as public health, by sharply restricting the use of antifoulant paints containing tributyltin and thus reducing the amount of tributyltin entering the waters of the state.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Any person who operates a watercraft in waters over which this state has jurisdiction impliedly consents to submit to the chemical test provisions of this chapter as a condition of operating a watercraft in this state.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> A law enforcement officer having probable cause to believe that a person has committed an offense under this chapter shall offer the person the opportunity to submit to a chemical test. It is not necessary for the law enforcement officer to offer a chemical test to an unconscious person. A law enforcement officer may offer a person more than one chemical test under this chapter. However, all tests must be administered within three (3) hours after the officer had probable cause to believe the person violated this chapter. A person must submit to each chemical test offered by a law enforcement officer in order to comply with the implied consent provisions of this chapter.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> If the chemical test results in relevant evidence, as defined in § 46-22.2-2(6) that the person is intoxicated, he or she may be arrested for an offense under this chapter. If the chemical test results in prima facie evidence as defined in § 46-22.2-2(5) that the person is intoxicated, he or she shall be arrested for an offense under this chapter.</p>

When a person is requested to submit to blood tests, only a physician or registered nurse or a medical technician certified under regulations promulgated by the director of the department of health may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content in it. This limitation shall not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.

Pursuant to 16 U.S.C. § 1452 (“The Coastal Zone Management Act”), the general assembly hereby directs the council (referred to as “CRMC”) to exercise effectively its responsibilities in the coastal zone through the development and implementation of management programs to achieve wise use of the land and water resources of the coastal zone.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> That these policies can best be achieved through the creation of a coastal resources management council as the principal mechanism for management of the state’s coastal resources.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(d)</b> The general assembly recognizes and declares that maintenance dredging is required to remove natural silt accumulations; Rhode Island has not had a general maintenance dredging policy and programs for ports, port facilities, channels, harbors, public and private marinas and boating facilities, recreational facilities and habitat areas; other major coastal states have maintenance dredging policies and in-water maintenance dredge disposal sites; as a result of the lack of a general maintenance dredging policy and program and as a result there has been:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> A decrease in the depth of the Providence Channel from forty-four (44) feet in 1971 to twenty-four (24) feet in 1996;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Navigational restrictions on ocean going vessels through the state’s waterways and channels; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> A decrease in the number of available slips and moorings at marinas throughout the state; and the lack of a maintenance dredging policy and programs have significant adverse environmental and economic effects on the state and therefore it is in the best interest of the state, the cities and towns of the state, and the citizens thereof for the state to have a general maintenance dredging policy and programs to resolve issues related to dredge maintenance and disposal and avoid future significant direct and indirect adverse impact on the environment and economy of the state.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(e)</b> The coastal resources management council is hereby designated as the lead state agency for purposes of dredging in tidal waters and as such shall have the following duties and responsibilities:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> To coordinate the interest of the state with regard to dredging;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> To formulate and adopt a state policy with regard to dredging which integrates those interests;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> To cooperate with, negotiate, and to enter into agreements on behalf of the state with the federal government and with other public bodies and private parties with regard to dredging;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> To act as the initial and primary point of contact for all applications to the state for dredging projects in tidal waters;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> To develop, prepare, adopt pursuant to § 46-23-11, implement, and maintain a comprehensive plan for dredge material management; and</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> To cooperate and coordinate with the departments of environmental management, transportation, administration, and health, and the economic development corporation in the conduct of these duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(f) (1)</b> The legislature recognizes that under Article I, § 17, the submerged lands of the state are impressed with a public trust and that the state is responsible for the protection of the public’s interest in these lands. The state maintains title in fee to all soil within its boundaries that lies below the high water mark, and it holds that land in trust for the use of the public. In benefiting the public, the state preserves certain public rights which include, but are not limited to, fishery, commerce, and navigation in these waters and the submerged lands that they cover.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Since its establishment in 1971, the CRMC has had the authority to manage and plan for the preservation of the coastal resources of the state including, but not limited to, submerged lands. The legislature hereby declares that, in light of the unique size, scope, and overall potential impact upon the environment of large scale filling projects involving twenty-five (25) acres or more, any lease of tidal lands, or any license to use those lands, is subject to approval, disapproval, or conditional approval by the direct enactment of the general assembly by legislative action. The CRMC shall review all requests for leases, licenses to use the land, and other authority to use the land made by any applicant prior to presentation of the request to the general assembly, and the CRMC shall make recommendations on the request to the general assembly. With the exception of any and all projects to fill land of twenty-five (25) acres or more, the general assembly hereby recognizes and declares that the CRMC is delegated the sole and exclusive authority for the leasing of submerged and filled lands and giving licenses for the use of that land. Accordingly, the CRMC will develop, coordinate, and adopt a system for the leasing of submerged and filled lands, and licenses for the use of that land, and will ensure that all leases and licenses are consistent with the public trust. Pursuant thereto, the CRMC shall impose a maximum fee of eighty thousand dollars ($80,000) per annum for any transatlantic cable that makes landfall in Rhode Island. All such fees collected shall be deposited into the Bays, Rivers and Watersheds Fund, established pursuant to § 46-31-12.1, and shall be disbursed according to the purposes of that fund. Nothing contained in this subsection negates, repeals, or alters the provisions, processes, and requirements for the leasing of submerged land for the conduct of aquaculture as set out under chapter 10 of title 20. Therefore, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or impair the authority of the state, or any duly established agency of the state, to regulate filling or dredging affecting tidal lands owned by the state or any other entity, and nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or impair the obligation of the applicant to obtain all applicable regulatory approvals. Specifically, and without limiting the foregoing, nothing in this subsection negates, repeals, or alters the provisions, processes, and requirements for water quality certification contained in chapter 12 of this title.</p>

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6">Coastal and estuarine habitat such as coastal wetlands, anadromous fish runs, and eelgrass beds are threatened, damaged, or have been destroyed by historic pollution, oil spills, incompatible development, and other factors. The coastal and estuarine habitats of Rhode Island’s waters provide great benefits to the citizens of this state including, but not limited to, protection from coastal storms and erosion. Coastal and estuarine habitat resources also serve as nurseries and breeding grounds for important recreational and commercial finfish and shellfish populations, capture and filter run-off pollution, and significantly contribute to the state’s economic, community and ecological health. Restoration of tidally restricted coastal wetlands can also ensure protection of human health and safety by controlling populations of certain salt marsh mosquitoes known to carry the Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus. The state’s economy is directly dependent on the health and productivity of Rhode Island’s coastal waters, including Narragansett Bay and the coastal ponds. Destruction of coastal and estuarine habitats has been identified as one of the leading causes of decline in economically important fish, shellfish, and other natural resources. Restoring degraded coastal and estuarine habitats is essential for reversing declines in fishery resources and protecting human health and safety. Since healthy and diverse coastal and estuarine habitats are better able to support fish and wildlife resources that have been impacted, and are likely to be impacted in the future, by pollution events such as oil spills, an investment by the state of Rhode Island to provide restoration planning and technical expertise and to implement measures to restore coastal and estuary habitats is vital to the economic prosperity and quality of life of the citizens of the state.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(1) The production, transport, and use of fossil fuels have significant impacts on the environment.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(2) The impacts of climate change upon Rhode Island's built and natural environments are wide-ranging, discernible, and documented, and, in many cases growing in severity and include sea level rise, coastal erosion, increased precipitation, flooding, and storm surge.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(3) As of 2016, the range in sea level rise change is projected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to be a maximum of approximately one foot (1´) in 2035, two feet (2´) in 2050, and up to nine feet (9´) by 2100.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(4) Annual precipitation has increased by two inches (2") since 1950 and more intense rainfall is flooding low-lying areas and threatening public infrastructure.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(5) Climate change has and will continue to pose significant risks for state and municipal infrastructure and our environment, public health, welfare, and economic well-being.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(6) Providing areas for coastal and estuarine habitats to migrate is essential to preserving coastal and marine wildlife resources.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(7) Ecosystem services that natural environments provide, such as dampening of wave energy and flood storage, are at risk due to climate change, and protecting natural systems is vital to protecting built infrastructure and is cost effective.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(8) Rhode Island infrastructure is at risk and the state must begin to plan and implement projects to adapt to changing conditions.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(9) Reducing the vulnerability of our infrastructure is vital to the economic prosperity and quality of life of the citizens of the state.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(10) The state, cities, and towns need a dedicated, long-term source of funding to assist in implementing projects to address the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“(11) The purpose of this chapter is to create the Ocean State Climate Adaptation and Resilience (OSCAR) fund as a dedicated long-term source of grant funds to enable cities and towns to implement projects that restore and improve the climate resilience of vulnerable coastal habitats, as well as river and stream floodplains with priority to projects that improve community resilience and public safety.”</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>P.L. 1999, ch. 307, § 3 provides that the provisions of that act or any other provisions of the general laws to the contrary, the members of the Narragansett Bay water quality management district commission and the officers thereof appointed, qualified, and in office immediately prior to the passage of that act shall continue to be members of the Narragansett Bay Commission during the remainder of the terms for which they were appointed or until their resignation, death, incapacity, or other removal from office. All property or rights to property held by the Narragansett Bay water quality management district commission shall transfer to and be held by the Narragansett Bay Commission without any necessity for any document of transfer or recording thereof. Any act taken by the Narragansett Bay water quality management district commission prior to the passage of that act, valid at the time such act was taken, shall, subject to such discretion as the commission may lawfully exercise to the continuance or modification thereof, remain valid and shall be considered to have been taken by the Narragansett Bay Commission. The secretary of the commission shall maintain the books and records of the Narragansett Bay water quality management district commission as the books and records of the Narragansett Bay Commission. The authority granted and obligations imposed by section 46-25-37 through and including section 46-25-44 of chapter 46-25 of the general laws shall apply to the Narragansett Bay Commission as the successor to the Narragansett Bay water quality management district commission. Except as otherwise set forth herein, in any action, suit or other proceeding to which the Narragansett Bay water quality management district commission was a party immediately prior to the passage of that act, the Narragansett Bay Commission shall be substituted as a party. To the extent in any such proceeding the powers and duties of the Narragansett Bay Commission after the passage of that act are in issue, the commission shall be regarded as having the powers and duties set forth in that act, as it may be amended from time to time; provided that the commission shall in any event have the power to carry out any agreement validly undertaken by the Narragansett Bay water quality management district commission for the duration of such agreement without regard to any amendment thereof or extension thereto occurring after the passage of that act.</p>

<p class="p6">It is hereby found and declared that:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> There exists in the Providence metropolitan area and Narragansett Bay severe water quality problems resulting from the discharge of pollutants, conventional, and unconventional, into Narragansett Bay.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> It is further found and declared that Narragansett Bay may be the greatest natural resource of the state of Rhode Island, and continuing discharge of these pollutants jeopardizes the environmental integrity of the entire Narragansett Bay and creates severe and detrimental ecological and economic impact upon the people of the state of Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(3)</b> It is further found and declared that because of the scope and complexity of the work necessary to correct and minimize these pollution discharges and the scope of financing required, local municipal governments in the Providence metropolitan area have been unable alone to cope properly and immediately with the magnitude of the pollution discharges.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(4)</b> It is further found and declared that economy and efficiency dictate the desirability for an overall plan for dealing with pollution discharges in the Narragansett Bay and the Providence metropolitan area.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(5)</b> It is further found and declared that the most effective and efficient method to combat the discharge of pollutants in the Narragansett Bay is to create a Narragansett Bay water quality management district commission, to be charged with the acquisition, planning, construction, financing, extension, improvement, and operation and maintenance of publicly owned sewage treatment facilities in the Narragansett Bay water quality management district, with appropriate provision for a portion of the financing of the activities to be undertaken by the pledging of the full faith and credit of the state of Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> Title 46, chapter 21 created the Blackstone Valley district commission and charged it with the planning, construction, operation, and maintenance of facilities to deal with the sewage and industrial wastes which originate in municipalities and industries located in the Blackstone and Moshassuck Valleys and are discharged into the waters of the state including the Seekonk and Blackstone rivers which flow into the Narragansett Bay without proper treatment.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(7)</b> Economy, efficiency and technological advances dictate the desirability of having one entity to formulate, coordinate, and regulate an overall plan to reduce the discharge of sewerage and industrial wastes originating from the Blackstone and Moshassuck Valleys into the waters of this state and the discharge of pollutants into Narragansett Bay from the Narragansett Bay water quality management district.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(8)</b> The most effective and efficient method of effectuating such an overall plan is to merge the Blackstone Valley district commission with and into the Narragansett Bay water quality management district commission.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(9)</b> The most effective and efficient method of effectuating an overall plan for dealing with discharges in the watershed of the Narragansett Bay is the merger, consolidation, acquisition, operation and management of other sewage treatment facilities located in the state with or by the Narragansett Bay water quality management district commission as the commission may from time to time determine.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> All revenue bonds and notes issued by the commission, may be secured by the full faith and credit of the commission and may be payable solely out of the revenues, earnings, and receipts of the commission or such other property pledged for payment. The revenue bonds and notes may be executed and delivered by the commission at any time, from time to time, may be in such form and denominations and of such tenor and maturities, and may be in bearer or registered form, as to principal and interest or as to principal alone, all as the commission, in its sole discretion, may determine.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(f)</b> There may be retained, by provision made in the proceedings under which any revenue bonds or revenue notes of the commission are authorized to be issued, an option to redeem all or any part thereof at such prices and upon such notice, and on such further terms and conditions, as shall be set forth on the record of the proceedings and on the face of the revenue bonds and notes.</p>

The proceeds of revenue bonds or revenue notes issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding revenue bonds or revenue notes may be applied, in the discretion of the commission, to the purchase, retirement at maturity, or redemption of the outstanding revenue bonds or revenue notes either on their earliest or a subsequent redemption date, and may, pending an application, be placed in escrow. Any escrowed proceeds may be invested and reinvested in obligations of the United States and, to the extent permitted by the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds to be refunded, in obligations guaranteed by the United States, or in certificates of deposit or time deposits secured or guaranteed by the state of Rhode Island or the United States, or an instrumentality of either, maturing at such time or times as shall be appropriate to assure the prompt payment, as to principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, of the outstanding revenue bonds or revenue notes to be so refunded. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the interest, income, and profits, if any, earned or realized on any investment may also be applied to the payment of the outstanding revenue bonds or revenue notes to be so refunded. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied and carried out, any balance of the proceeds and interest, income, and profits, if any, earned or realized on the investments thereof, may be returned to the commission for its use. The portion of the proceeds of revenue bonds or revenue notes issued for the additional purpose of paying all or part of the cost of acquiring, financing, extending, operating, maintaining, constructing, reconstructing, rehabilitating, developing, planning, or improving any sewage treatment facility, may be invested and reinvested in such obligations, securities, and other investments consistent herewith as shall be specified in the resolutions under which the revenue bonds or revenue notes are authorized, and which shall mature not later than the times when the proceeds will be needed for such purposes.

<p class="p5">Text</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> Rhode Island needs an affirmative, clearly articulated program to plan for, manage and protect its rivers and watershed resources on an integrated, inter-agency basis, that supports systems level planning.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b)</b> Many of the rivers of Rhode Island or sections thereof and related adjacent land possess outstanding aesthetic and recreational value of present and potential benefit to the citizens of this state. The preservation and protection of these rivers and their immediate environment together with their significant recreational, natural and cultural value is hereby declared to be a public policy. It shall be the policy of the state of Rhode Island to protect these values and to practice sound conservation policies and practices relative thereto. It is also recognized that it is in the public interest to:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Preserve open space, natural resources and features, and scenic landscapes;</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> Preserve cultural and historic landscapes and features;</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(6)</b> Continue the regional and comprehensive planning activities for rivers, water quality, and land use conducted by the Rhode Island department of environmental management and the Rhode Island department of administration; and</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> It is, therefore, essential that a Rhode Island policy be developed so that these purposes may be fulfilled. The general assembly affirms that it must assure the people of this generation and their descendants the opportunity to appreciate aesthetic and utilize the recreational qualities and resources of the state’s streams and rivers. To implement these policies is the purpose of this chapter and in furtherance thereof to establish the Rhode Island rivers council which will coordinate and oversee the clean up and preservation of the quality of rivers in Rhode Island.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(a)</b> The financial obligation for the upgrading of the public water supply system to be annexed and the continued management and operational responsibility to bring that system into compliance with the applicable regulations and on parity with the existing facilities of the governing agency must be fairly and equitably allocated to the new customers by identifying:</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(1)</b> Capital costs;</p>

<p class="p6">and adding the annexation fee to the governing agency’s existing rate structure currently in effect to be applied to the customer’s accounts, to be annexed.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>(b) (1)</b> Each year the annexation fee to be paid by the new customers shall be added to the rate apportioned to the existing customers of the governing agency and shall represent the amortized cost of the capital expenditures and the appropriate ongoing operational costs adjusted for inflation. The annexation fee shall in no event be less than ten percent (10%) the rate levied on the pre-annexation customer base, nor shall it be more than one hundred percent (100%) of the pre-annexation rate. This legislation is not intended to limit the governing agency from recovering all costs of service from its basic customer base. The annexation fee shall constitute a part of the cost of annexation and shall also be an allocated portion of the cost of annexation and become a debt of each customer from the small public water supply system to the governing agency and be collectible in the same manner and have the benefit of any lien provided for the amounts due for water charges from the small public water supply system to the governing agency. Subject to the provisions of § 39-1.1-1 for those small public water supply systems which are public utilities, all governing agencies may terminate service for failure of the customer of a small public water supply system to pay the annexation fee.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span><b>(2)</b> It shall not be necessary for any small public water supply system or governing agency whose rates may be regulated by the public utilities commission, pursuant to chapter 1 of title 39, to obtain approval from the commission for billing of the annexation fee. The public utilities commission shall not be required, in determining rates for any governing agency or small public water supply system hereunder, to consider the annexation fees billed hereunder when determining revenue requirements for the governing agency or public water supply system.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(c)</b> The annexation fee shall terminate when the contractual obligation for amortizing the upgrading of the system petitioning annexation has been discharged or no later than thirty (30) years from the date of financing said improvements, whichever comes first.</p>

The annexation as provided for herein shall not impair the obligation of any contract or agreement or alter existing bargaining units nor abate any suit, action, or other proceeding lawfully commenced by or against the public water supply system, or any member of its governing board in relation to the discharge of his or her official duties, but a court of competent jurisdiction may, on motion filed within twelve (12) months after the effective date of the annexation, allow such a suit, action, or proceeding to be maintained by or against the annexed public water supply system or any member of its governing board in relation to the discharge of his or her official duties. Upon completion of the merger, all user charges, fees or rates assessed by the governing agency as a result of the merger shall be subject to the approval of the public utilities commission.</p>
